Standing under the famous sign at Lands End in the poring rain had me bursting with anticipation, the ride to the other end of the country on my Penny Farthing was about to start. My first port of call was the village of Sennen which is the most Westerly in the country.  Wheeling away from here the undulating landscape rolled me onwards between stone walls, guiding me down moss covered lanes, with a view out over a boisterous sea. The falling rain hadn't dampened my spirits, but it had made the roadway rather slippery, the long pushes up the hills were fine, coming down on the other hand was proving to be quite an exciting experience!  Passing through the bay that is St Ives I rode onwards through the damp afternoon and ended up 55 miles from Lands End in the town of Trencreek, and placed my soggy self in my tiny Bivi tent. I bypassed the surfers paradise of Nequay in the morning, riding along the coast to Padstow which is a roller coaster ride of dips and valleys, producing somewhat aching muscles in most parts of my legs.  Taking the small ferry across the water to the town of Rock, I wheeled onwards until a coffee stop was internally required. Leaning the Bicycle against the wall of a cafe, a good deal of interest was shown by the owners as I told them of the Penny and of my trip, to the point of not having to pay for my coffee, most generous indeed. My next port of call was the fabulous Camelford Cycle Museum, a wonderful collection owned by John and Sue Middleton, who treated me ever so well during my visit, definitely a "not to be missed" place on the itinerary of any End to Ender. I crossed the river Tamer and entered Devon which significantly for me was my first new county, on the tiny lanes I became hopelessly lost, and at days end knocked on the door of a farm house to ask permission to camp on their land. An hour later, full with coffee, I found myself sitting in a holiday chalet situated on the farms land, with all mod cons at my disposal, again most generously given to me for free. Some fine and splendid pulse inducing downhill wheeling was had in the morning from Bratton Clovelly , leading me around the narrow and steep lanes on the edges of Dartmoor.  While foot riding up one of these roads I noticed some rather alarming cracks in the Penny's headset, the potholes and surface over which I had been wheeling obviously having taken there toll. One more downhill and I am sure disagreeable disaster would have occurred, which did make me quite happy to have spotted the problem. I stopped at the next garage and had them weld up the frame for me and also put in some reinforcement pieces, all again most kindly without any charge. Lost again in the afternoon I stopped outside the Beer Engine pub in Newton St Cyres and was instantly lured inside by fellow touring cyclists Rita Bryan and Paul Collins, where splendid conversation, food and ale set me up perfectly for the rest of the day.  My day finished in a farmers barn, the bivi pitched on a bed of straw which I shared with a dead rabbit, and a most lively mouse, and owl. I crossed into Somerset on the next day, missing the photo at the sign as I was heading down a hill in the poring rain, so was quite unable to stop in time. Passing through Taunton and out onto the Somerset flats the miles were now really flying away beneath me, having crossed the M5 I saw ahead a lone figure walking towards me, from his appearance I instantly knew his occupation, and we both said "End to Ender" when we met. This walking fellow had been on the road for six weeks, ski poles in hand he was soon on his way, I guess not wanting to loose his rhythm. I passed the Glastonbury Tor on the horizon, pushing on now too Cheddar Gorge, I was disappointed with both the caves that I visited, one of them being especially tacky with wizards and goblins strategically placed all about. Taking the wrong road out of town I found myself with an hours footing up and over the Mendip hills, the benefit being the long freewheel back down the other side. The end of the day found me sleeping in a horse ridding paddock having again been plied gratefully with more food and coffee. I wheeled over long flat roads in the morning which bought me to the Avon bridge, this proved to be too steep to ride so I ended up with a fair push looking down on a mist covered river. Rolling onwards along my route after a few "getting lost" diversions I came to the Seven bridge which was to deliver me into Wales. The ascent here was happily quite shallow so I was able to ride to the centre and eat the celebratery chocolate bar I had been saving for the occasion of crossing into Wales. Passing by the the expanse of Chepstow racecourse, I wheeled onwards to reach the start of the lovely Wye Valley, miles I then rode following the course of the river, with my machine and I encased in the lush trees of the valley sides. The ruins of Tintern Abbey appeared out of the foliage, the imposing structure standing strong amongst well kept lawns, here I met an old South African fellow, still carrying ice cream on his lip from a previous meal. The peace of the Abbey seemed a long way from the troubles of his country, though looking at its ruined walls it has also seen a good deal of strife before finding its current state of peace. Monmouth appeared with a great deal of charm, and from here I was once again on the tiny back lanes, placing me amid a thick forest with only the sounds of nature and my gasping lungs for company. These were real 20 step hills, to explain, I could only manage 20 steps of pushing my machine and then would have to stop to regain my breath. The sun was now low in the sky as I left the forest and came across the wonderful Skenfrith castle, I had been gratefully directed by a lady in the forest to the home of Tony and Lorraine Webb, who's wonderful hospitality I enjoyed for the evening. The Webb family sent me off in the morning with a full stomach and a happy smile, this carried me to the start of what is locally known as the Golden Valley following the course of the river Dore.  I wheeled down the verdant lanes to reach the lovely 14th century town of Pembridge, then crossing the river Arrow the heavens once again decided to open and treat me to another good soaking. By the time I had reached the remains of Hopton Castle thankfully the rain had stopped, and it was now time for me to do the same, calling at the local farm soon had me ensconced in a wheat barn with the bivi tied between a tractor and wooden pallet. The town of Bishops Castle appeared in the morning, the 13 century buildings all seemed unblemished by any modern structures, even the goods being sold within the shops appeared to be in keeping with the town, the townsfolk are obviously proud, and keen to keep it this way. The countryside now became a rolling greensward, the hills staying either side of me as I headed along the valley floor towards Church Stoke, and by lunchtime the flat wheeling had given me over 30 miles on the clock, so I stopped and treated myself to a good hours lunch as a reward. When the afternoon came I found myself lost once again, this time in the town of Oswestry, I stopped in a pub for directions and a girl by the bar set me straight. Unfortunately her confidence was not all that high, so she checked with a group of rather merry "old boys". We then had a mass discussion of about 10 very complicated routes, and so I had to surreptitiously leave them arguing as I wheeled away ! When the day ended I found myself in the White Lion pub in Wittington on the premise to ask permission to camp in their beer garden. The sea of friendly faces which met me was a real pleasure, and so I just sat and chatted for an hour, then Llew a member of the Ctc and fellow cycle tourist offered me with great generosity and kindness a bed and meal for the night. Llew sent me off with a lovely full breakfast inside in the morning which was most pleasant, a truly splendid fellow.  The long and agreeably winding road then took me to the village of Beeston, here I met a family who were sure my accent was Cornish, but when finally giving in directed me up to the fabulous ruins of the castle perched high on a hill overlooking the surrounding lands.  The next day I had planned to be one of few and easy miles, this to take me to Knutsford for the Sundays "Great Race". Unfortunately my other pedal crank decided that it also would now choose to break so the morning was spent going from town to town in the attempt to find a fellow with a welder. With this eventually accomplished I wheeled on Northwards and found myself in the afternoon arriving in Knutsford. I headed down along the highstreet and located the Penny Farthing museum and its owner and race organiser Glynn Stockdale. There I also met Nicky Armstrong the woman's Australian Penny Farthing champion who had just ridden 1200km across Germany on her Penny complete with trailer and large Penguin ! Here also was Robert Kniefacz one of the group of wheelmen from Austria I had met via the Internet who had just flown, and ridden in for the race. The race day on the Sunday dawned with heavy poring rain, and this theme it kept up for the rest of the event. The competition for the 76 riders was started by David Soul complete with blunderbuss, my stripped down Penny now feeling so light having shed it load. The first hour and a half of the race I had the leaders in my sights, but from this point onwards I started to struggle, and by two and a half hours I was dying in the saddle. As the clock wound round to the 3 hour mark it was all I could do to stay on my machine, I have really never been so close to passing out due to physical effort. At race end I had covered 42 miles in the 3 hours, the winners must have covered at least 50 miles, and I take my hat off to them as they were still going strong ! Nicky won the ladies section and very nearly won the whole event, coming second in the final standings. I think I probably came in the top 15 (there only being 15 solo riders, the rest were in teams) and Robert likewise finished in a similar position.  The Knutsford race had been the most exhausting thing that I have ever done, but looking back, was a truly fantastic event, meeting so many wonderful fellow riders was a real pleasure and is something I will not forget for a long time. The next day I wheeled to the east of Warrington and immediately noticed a strong change into a Liverpool ish accent, and when only 26 miles appeared on my clock I chose to stop for the day as my weary body was still aching. Besides I bet none of my fellow competitors had been riding their machines the day after the race! As another first, my slumbers were spent in the Forman's office of an open cast coal mine, which thankfully was dry and warm.  Arriving in Up Holland I felt it was time to retreat from the poring rain, stepping into a garage within five minutes of chatting I had a cup of coffee in hand and good conversation in mind. This set me up well for the ride onto Preston, coming into this city from the green highways and byways so far encountered did seem quite strange at first, the archetypal Northern houses standing out to my Southern eyes. I stopped in a cycle shop to buy some spare cotters, these again were given for free being the last of their stock. When I was out of the city I managed to once again become completely lost, and a severe lack of road signs also didn't really help the situation. Then a lady called Nancy stopped her car and asked what I was doing, then with a little cajoling she had me wheeling to the local primary school to show my machine to the children. Goosnargh Oliversons Primary School gave me a very warm welcome, and I gave a talk and answered lots of questions from the very lucid pupils, a quick spin for a demonstration around the playground, and I was out of the gate and once more on the road. The afternoon started to draw in, so stopping at a dairy farm I was kindly offered an old box trailer to sleep in, this was very fortunate as the rain turned into an incredible thunder storm overnight, which I was glad I wasn't camped out in. Lancaster came and went in the morning, surprising me as I had expected the city to be a good deal larger. After Lancaster Carnforth came and the scenery started to change from the rolling flatlands to stone walls and the start of the Lake district hills.  As I edged my way towards Lake Windermere, mountains started to put in a very obvious appearance on the landscape, which also caused a good deal of footing to be used to climb this new beautiful spectacle. The sky had now come down from it accustomed perch, bringing with it copious amounts of water, the roadway now becoming a river which did seem quite strange to wheel through, and spotting and avoiding pot holes proved quite difficult.  Streams running down to the lake formed waterfalls from all directions, the forest to one side and the lake to the other closed in and held me in its natural grasp. At Dunmail Raise I pushed for 3/4 of an hour to reach its summit, then downhill through the weather, for I was truly within it, the occasional cars lights showing me the way ahead even though it was only 3 o'clock in the afternoon. I finally came down into a valley and stopped at a hotel, here leaving a trail of water in my wake I stumbled in and hastily downed some revitalising coffee. I ended up having a splendid chat to two David's and their respective spouses, one of whom was David Dodsworth a well known artist. I also gave in and took a room in the hotel as the rain was still poring down in unabated fashion, and showed no signs of giving up. I partook in a huge dinner like breakfast in the morning which happily came free with the room and helped to justify sleeping inside for a night, and this feeling of being full set off again into the falling sky's of the day. I reached the A66 and then turned off onto a tiny lane which led to Mungrisedale, this was very muddy with short sharp climbs, and gates placed across the road around hidden bends to try and catch out the unwary wheelman. This nearly happened when a gate appeared at the bottom of a short hill, wet and muddy brakes not working, had me leaping from the machine as the only way to stop in time and avoid a heavy connection with the obstruction, the only witnesses to the near calamity being the many perplexed sheep by the roadside. Carlisle was reached just after lunchtime and I was extremely perplexed by how silent the city seemed, I crossed an old wooden floored bridge which is now part of the Sustrans cycle route, and performed a tricky negotiation of a cycle gate with the help of a lady cyclist. Once out of the city the wheeling was happily rather flat and at this moment I saw the sign which said "Scotland". Crossing into a new country is always special and this was no different, it is always something to be remembered.  I pulled into Gretna Green and there waiting was a horse and carriage and full Scottish piper, though awaiting a wedding party and not me. Also visiting was Swassie, a larger than life character with handlebar moustache and only one leg, who was a fellow End to Ender, and had completed the trip in May in 44 days in his wheelchair, an amazing achievement. Wheeling west I arrived in the town of Annan, finding the campsite closed for the winter I was fortunate that a Penny Farthing sized hole existed in the surrounding fence which gave me access to the empty camp. When I passed through the town of Sanquhar I started to notice how many of the small towns seemed to be based about the one passing long main road, and were all constructed of inward facing single story houses. A headwind had been making itself felt during the day so I stopped in a tiny bar to get a revitalising drink. When I entered the smoke filled and dimly lit establishment the clientele fell silent, a few smiles and hellos later half were to be found outside checking if my story was true, and the other were treating me to free drinks! The new day started with a good hard ride over the rolling countryside up to the port of Ardrossan just as the ferry to the Isle of Arran was leaving. Thankfully I only had to wait a couple of hours for the next sailing, and with an hour at sea I was on the stunning Arran. This I felt was the Scotland of my dreams, glorious mountains rising up every way you looked, your only way into their hidden delights is via the Glens they have given you for this purpose.  I fell asleep that night watching shooting stars, listening to a rushing stream, and breathing the freshest air you could imagine. In the morning I mounted my machine and wheeled along the East coast towards the town of Lochranza, the roadway initially followed the coast line then headed inland along the floor of another beautiful Glen. Here I had to start to footride for over an hour to reach the summit of the pass, as my height increased the temperature came down and so did the clouds to surround me.  The small northern island ferry took me away from Arran, and I said a fond farewell to this lovely island. At the once prosperous Herring fishing port of Tarbert, I stopped and bought some stamps from a rather butch deep voiced lady who was in need of a visit to the shaving parlour, "she" then gruffly directed me to a pub where I could procure some Haggis. This I most definitely enjoyed even though I wasn't to sure of its contents. With the wind on my back I flew along the banks of Loch Fyne making a splendid pace, the rain then came again with a torrent, soaking me immediately to the skin, but strangely this I didn't mind as looking at the occasional dry cocooned motorist I felt that I wouldn't have swapped places with them for any amount of tea that China could supply.  The new mornings mist kept company with heavy rain as I set out on the roadway, and the friendly wind of the previous day had changed allegiance to gust upon my face in an energy sapping manner. I then started a roller coaster ride through forested mountains with switchback bends taking me in all directions, craggy outcrops breathing life into the rushing streams which were my companions for the day, not so the few cars which passed, housing people shut off from the wind, rain and powerful beauty of the surrounding nature. While wheeling down one hill I rounded a bend to find myself enveloped by a group of smiling Germans.  Cameras clicking and a lure of Glenfidish whiskey pulling me to a halt, a boisterous chat with these splendid fellows, and a swig of their bait helped me acquire the energy for the rest of the day! When reaching the pretty town of Oban the rain ceased its downward course as I had a coffee in a small cafe, In came a group of people who said they had passed me earlier in the day in the storm and thought that they had been seeing things! At Barcaldine I stopped and had some more coffee and biscuits with some people who were driving a camper van and had kindly thought I could probably do with the sustenance. Their one legged dog then tried to get himself run over which was strange as you would think he would have already learnt his lesson.  The rain outside and the condensation inside my bivi tent had made everything thoroughly wet by the morning, and the rolling up of the sleeping bag had to be done in the campsites loos to keep the mud away from the bag. The wind had thankfully changed direction overnight and now lay its gentle hand to my back, assisting me in my course for the day. I arrived at a rather steep inclination at Portnacroish and spent a goodly time pushing the Penny up and out of the forest, the scene before me when I broke the cover of the trees was truly superb. Looking out across Loch Linhe you could see a tiny island upon which Castle Stalker had been built, its solitude and defiance against the elements gave it great power and beauty. Stopping at a Fort William cafe for a celebratery coffee and Haggis, four old ladies entered and sat down. The shouted conversation consisted of the cost of cabbage and who's turn it was to go to the toilet, I even managed to meet the youngest one trying to find the oldest one in the gents! Following the roadway around to the start of Loch Lochy, I found myself sweeping down through the rain and mist to the shoreside, my machine still spinning well even after all the abuse that it had been subjected to. Along the banks of Loch Oich I then wheeled, and at the end you are able to then take a canal path on to Loch Ness, coming down the hill to the swing bridge where the pathway starts I was, as usual unable to stop because of the machines wet brakes. By the time I had come to a halt the barriers had come down trapping me within, the far side was closest so these I found my way around, and not wishing to wait for the boats to pass through took the empty road on to Loch Ness. When I reached the most famous of all the Scottish Lochs I looked and called but unfortunately no monster of the reptile kind answered my calls, though two Tornado jet fighters did suddenly appear and then were gone, as quickly as to be missed by any slow moving beasty photographer.  The road surface along the banks of loch Ness were also causing a few problems, my tyre was finding the course tarmac rather rough, the constant vibration making spinning the wheel a good deal harder, and would probably make my teeth fall out if I wore the false variety. At Urquhart Castle a huge amount of construction work was being carried out and they had also placed a horrid modern unit in the grounds which looked totally out of place. I was approached by some gleefully happy people who while taking photos of my machine explained the reason for their glee. They had seen me a few days before descending a hill with legs off expecting an accident, I had apparently survived but they had missed the photo. So now they had proof of their story to take home, and thought it was even better than seeing the monster! Before reaching Inverness the two current broken spokes were joined by another so I stopped and replaced these by the roadside at the base of an enormous oak tree. I saw the Kessock bridge first off in the distance spanning the Moray Firth, then entered and left Inverness by the main route up and onto the bridge. Dismounting was the order of the day as a howling wind was blowing, which would easily take a wheelman to his watery grave as the guard rail was only just below knee height when mounted! The mornings ride out of Mulochy had me feeling the first disagreeably cold winds of winter on my person, and a stop had to be made to find my gloves as my hands had become quite numb. Heading for the Northern point of the Black Isle had me wending my footsteps for a goodly time up a large hill just outside the town of Fortrose, when this was completed my reward was given in a splendid freewheel down to the town of Cromarty. Upon arrival I discovered that the only ferry was now on winter time, and a wait until 4 o'clock in the afternoon would be in order. In some locations being marooned for a day would be rather annoying, but thankfully the Tea houses, Pubs and people of Cromarty made me feel extremely welcome for my days sojourn.  At the designated time I set foot on the rusty and small ferry with some trepidation as the sea had now taken rather a brutish swell across its stage, the captain assured me that his vessel was unlikely to sink and 15 long minutes later I was happily deposited on the opposing shore. In Lower Pitcalnie I stopped in the B+B of Richard and Sabine Cross, who treated me with great kindness and warmth, I couldn't recommend this B+B more highly. The new morning found me wheeling along the surprisingly quite A9, and being surrounded by almost Essex like countryside proved no problem to the pace of my wheeling. The Dornoch bridge directed me safely across the ever so still and beautiful Dornoch Firth then on to the town of Golspie. Here my machine and I once more joined the line of the coast and its gently rising mountains, and were rewarded for our efforts with stunning views out over the North sea. When reaching the town of Helmsdale an enormous long climb appeared before me, the grade of which I knew would be impossible to ride and filled me with a certain degree of dread. Up and up I pushed for an age, and around every bend the roadway seemed to go on ever upwards towards the clouds. When finally the summit was gained, the way fell downwards in a wondrous decent, passing the sign for the Berriedale Braes I held my breath as this had been the location of many a cropper of wheelmen of past times. Down my wheel and I flew with brakes full on and fingers stinging while holding the levers, thankfully we arrived at the base complete and unscathed. A short yet very steep switchback series of bends then bought me back to the top of the mountains, and here the steering damper broke. This caused quite a commotion with the steering of the bicycle, nearly pitching me straight to the floor by the roadside. The only cure, bar a new damper, was to transfer as much weight to the front of the handlebars as possible to prevent the shimmying, this helped and at least allowed me to ride, although only with a great deal of caution.  I took my departure from Dunbeath in the morning with a very jaunty machine beneath me, yet the excitement of possibly reaching my goal on this day had me ignoring the difficulty. As I wheeled onwards the miles ticked down to Wick, the cold grew colder and the wind grew stronger, yet I knew the only halt I was going to make during the day was going to be my final one. The signs in Wick, when I arrived, said 17 miles to John O'Groats. Each hill crested had me searching the horizon, then tormenting me the road gave more grades to push up, on we travelled and then finally a sign appeared, one that I had ridden a long way to see, "Welcome to John o'Groats".  My machine and I had covered 1100 miles in 22 days, and we had loved every minute of it, roll on the world!                                 
Questions I had before touring on a recumbent or a  tandem recumbent were: Can it be done? Can you get all the gear your need on board? Where do you put it? Can you make it up the hills. Will it be terribly slow compared to touring on a wedgie? We found that it is practical to tour on a recumbent, solo or tandem. We rode up all the hills that I was able to ride up solo, but we had to walk some extra steep pitches as I did on the solo. I have seen riders on solo wedgies doing the same. We were not as fast as some athletic riders, but were just as fast as average riders. We kept up with two groups who had sag wagons to carry their gear, so I don't feel we were slow at all. My first tour on a recumbent was to the Washington coast from Bainbridge Island on a solo bike. It worked fine. I ate in restaurants, but camped out. Next I toured the Oregon Coast doing camping and fixing my own food. Then I toured with my son from Reedsport Or. to Santa Cruz, Ca. We camped and fixed our own food. These trips were successful on the recumbent (Rans V-Rex). I averaged around 10 mph which is what most mtn bike riders told me was their average speed. My son was significantly faster on his road bike. On these trips I learned how to pack a lot of gear on a recument. Wife and I did our first tandem recumbent tour on San Juan Island with our son and daughter in law. We camped out and fixed our own breakfast and lunch. Ate dinner in a restaurant. Next we did a three day tour around Hood Canal with camping, but no cooking. October, 2001, we toured from Monterey to San Luis Obispo, Ca, yuppie camping in motels. This mountainous ride proved we could handle a tough ride on our tanden recumbent. The secret to these trips was the under seat pannier rack, a fairly new item on the market. This allowed us to carry 4 panniers (two on rear rack). We could not have done the trip with just two panniers on the rear rack.  Another trick is to carry sleeping pads behind the rear seat. This requires a brace be added from the rear rack down to the rear seat mounting plate. The brace is a piece of aluminum bar 1 inch by 1/8 inch, bent to fit the space and bolted to the rack and the frame. It keeps the sleeping pads off of the fender where they would distort or break it. A bungee cord is used to keep the pads in place against the rear seat. One sleeping bag is in an underseat pannier with clothes, the other one is in a dry bag mounted between panniers on the left side. Two long webbing straps hold it in place. Our tent is the only thing on top of the rear rack. The tent poles and a few other things go into the seat backs. A fairly large zippered bag from Outdoor Research is mounted on the back of the rear seat and holds all our lunch stuff and some other things. A full tool kit in a zippered bag sits on the frame, strapped inside the underseat rack. I have never regretted carrying a complete tool kit. It has been a life saver for us and others. We carried spare tires and tubes, 20 and 26 inch. Click on the pictures for a larger view or choose Slideshow from the menu to see each one full size.

So I devised the following: Take the first possible train at 5:55 am. Get to Airolo by 10:00 am. Ride up the Gotthard, down to Andermatt, up the Oberalp, down to Disentis, up the Lukmanier, down to Biasca. Back home at 11:30 pm. 2500 m uphill elevation but (!) 3300 m downhill. This was a great ride and I can't resist posting some of the pictures, hoping that they will able to carry a little part of what I felt and saw.                                 
7:30 am.  It was too much later that most everyone showed up that was planning on doing the ride. My Dad had really wanted to do this ride with me and so he came along with me in my car.  Upon arrival we signed in at the registration area, got our maps, grabbed a few snacks, listened to the music playing in the background and watched all of the other cyclists make their way in.  This was the first time I had ever participated in an organized cycling event so I was really taking everything in.  I was amazed how many different types of cyclists there were.  You had everything from the recreational to the serious.  You even had the families that were out for a quick ride around town.  After we took a few pictures and stretched a few muscles it was off to the hills.    08:20 am - We officially started riding around 8:20 am and headed east out of Lincoln.  They had police directing traffic as we left they park and they made sure we had the right of way to cross.  The next couple of miles were a nice warm up.  At first I was worried about having to keep an eye on the map they had given us.  But I soon found that there were yellow arrows painted on the street and yellow plates on poles directing us at every turn.  Soon the warm up was over and it was time to start climbing.  Little did I realize just what kind of climbing we would be doing.  Our first hill was up a street called Gold Hill.  It should actually be called straight up hill.  In the beginning it wasn't that bad, but the higher you got the more it went up.  This hill average between 8% and 10% as far as the grade.  It actually peaked at 15%.  There were a number of riders in the pack as we went up this hill.  At one point it was a little hairy as a car came speeding by on our left and a hummer came down the hill.  Thank goodness no one was riding double file.  You really had to stay to the right of the road, even though it was a road out in the middle of no where you still had cars.    09:00 - Soon we left Gold Hill and turned onto Ridge.  Ridge was more of the same, straight up.  Soon the climbing was done and it was a nice ride straight down, of course the down hill never seems to be as long as the up hill.  As we rode through we had a number of opportunities to take in some breath taking views.  Oak trees are along many of the roads.  Then once you break out above the tree tops you have a view of the surrounding area from about 1,000 feet above see level. Many of the fields have just started to turn brown so it is quite the patch work of light green and browns.  We then had a gently down hill slope and then it was time for our first rest stop. 10:00 am - As we came in from the hills I thought we were right next to Interstate 80, but it was only State Route 193, a smaller road that takes you up and over to Auburn.  Located in the park and ride area was Rest Stop #1.  It already had a number of cyclists there enjoying the water, oranges, bananas, grapes, strawberries, and other things to quickly eat and move on.  I took a look at my stats real quick to gauge how I was doing so far.  Considering the hills we had just gone up and down I felt it was too bad. But I was hearing talk of Bald Hill being worse than what we had just done.  I better get another handful of fruit. Stats for Rest Stop #1:   Max mph: 24.6  Avg mph: 12.0  Distance: 11.32  Actual Time Riding: 0:56.15  Elevation Climbed: 942    10:15 am - After topping off the water bottles it was back on the bike heading for Bald Hill.  I soon found out what all of the rumblings were.  Bald hill is straight up, I was actually able to make it almost to the top without stopping, but I did not walk my bike.  I merely stopped took a breather to let my heart back into my chest and then I continued on for about 50 feet and then made it to the top.  From here it is a spectacular view of the Lincoln area.  You can see past Lincoln and over towards the Sutter Buttes.  But it's not exactly the best mode of travel to get this kind of view.  I had found early on in the Tour that I would be waiting a lot for my Dad to catch up.  While he has been training over the last two months, he has been at a disadvantage.  In Elk Grove there are no hills to practice climbing.  So it has been the flat lands for him.  This was all new to him as far as cycling goes.  I decided that I would wait for him at every major turn and every major hill to let him catch up.  Once at the top of Bald Hill it was another screaming ride down the back side.  At least this one lasted longer than the last down hill ride.  And within no time at all we were already at Rest Stop #2. 11:15 am - At this point my Dad and I were able to catch up with Jerold Dougal just before he headed back out.  He was enjoying the trip but knew he would be feeling it the next day.  Again we were greeted by a very friendly volunteer staff with lots of fruits, water, and bagels.  Just enough to keep the energy levels up.  We didn't know it at the time but Chris Gale was at least 20 minutes ahead of us all.  Connie and Bryce Hathaway were probably only about 10 minutes behind. We stayed here about 10 or 15 minutes and then it was time to hit the road again.   Stats for Rest Stop #2:  Max mph: 35.0  Avg mph: 12.9  Distance: 24.56  Actual Time Riding: 1:53:52  Elevation Climbed: 1,851 11:30 am - Shortly after we left Rest Stop #2 the 65 mile route (yellow route) took a right turn while the 41 mile route (blue route) continued straight on.  It was at this point the my Dad and I would be the last of the pack.  At the time we did not know it we figured there were others behind us.  But we had lost so much time climbing the hills we had dropped way back.  We were now heading North towards Camp Far West Reservoir and the housing was getting more and more sparse.  I was amazed how little there was out here.  Not the best place to get a flat or have any kind of trouble.  Along McCourtney road I saw something very novel, cows.  But it wasn't just the cows, in the middle of the herd was a cowboy.  I thought this was the coolest thing, when was the last time you saw a guy on a horse herding his cattle?  I can't remember when I saw that, in fact this was probably a first.  So I took a picture and moved on.    12:00 pm - Upon arriving at the main entrance of Camp Far West Reservoir I decided to pull over under a shade tree to wait for my Dad since we were making another turn before continuing on.  As I pulled over an older man in a pickup truck got out in a hurry came over and asked me if everything was okay, he let me know he was part of the Tour Volunteer Staff.  I let him know I was fine I was just waiting for my Dad to catch up.  He said, "I've got a radio if you need it."  I let him know everything was okay.  About 5 minutes later Dad showed up, he rested for a minute and then we continued on our way.  It was at this point that I did some calculations and figured we were not going to make it back in time for the barbeque.  It was only being served until 2:00 pm and we would not be back until at least 3:00 pm.  Due to the waiting at each turn for my Dad and letting him catch up we were only averaging about 12 to 13 miles an hour.  Not enough to make it back in time with 30 miles to go.  The next rest stop was still about 11 miles away, at least an hour ride with our pace.  The rode became very bad at this point.  Not that it was small with no bike lanes, it was very old and bumpy.  You had to be careful where you rode or you might bang up your rim. 01:00 pm - It was right around this time that we hit Rest Stop #3.  As we pulled up the older man in the truck had passed us up and was waiting for us here.  Soon after we arrived a van pulled up with the word SAG on the side of the vehicle.  We had seen this vehicle at least twice in the last hour as we made our way to the rest stop.  It was nice to know there were eyes out there watching over us.  I realized quickly that the volunteers at this Rest Stop were only there because we were the last on the route.  I asked when the last time a cyclist had stopped through, at least 20 minutes.  Well at least it wasn't an hour and twenty minutes.  We enjoyed the oranges and cold water.  There wasn't much else that we wanted.  After another fill-up of the water bottles and thanking the staff profusely for waiting on our behalf we moved on. Stats for Rest Stop #3: Max mph: 35.0 Avg mph: 13.2 Distance: 46.71 Actual Time Riding: 3:32:07 Elevation Climbed: 2,626    01:50 pm - It was around this time that the older man in the pickup passed us up and waved us down.  We pulled over and he wanted to know if my Dad wanted a ride back to the park.  I had already decided that I was going to finish the entire course.  I had the map so I knew where to go.  Dad said that no he wanted to finish up with me as well.  With that the volunteer radio man moved on.  In about a mile he was back on the side of the ride waving us to stop.  He said that he was supposed to inform us that the course was now officially closed and that there would be no support vehicles out on the road for us.  Next he said that the support team wanted to know he we wanted to have a lunch saved for us.  I knew it would be at least another hour before we finished, there was no way I was going to make someone wait for the next hour for me.  I told the volunteer we would again be fine, we filled up at the last Rest Stop and would be good until the end, and that they did not need to hold a lunch for us.  At this point I asked for the name of the volunteer that was so willing and eager to help us out, his name was Carl Lind (hope I spelt it right).  Carl asked one more time to make sure we didn't want a ride back to the park.  There were only 12 more miles to go, I was bound and determined to finish.  Carl was concerned about my Dad and wanted to make sure my Dad would be okay, Dad said he would be fine.  I shook Carl's hands and thanked him for being such a caring volunteer.  It's people like Carl that make these rides great.  Carl drove off waving and we headed back out on the road for the final stretch, Sun City. 02:30 pm - After a nice ride down Highway 193 we made a right turn onto Sierra College Drive to come up to the back side of Sun City Lincoln.  The cycling club I'm in started practicing here at Sun City two months ago.  We would go up and down the many hills located here in this senior community.  The big hill on the back side was to be the last hill of the day.  We made our way up and as I had all day long I waited at the top for Dad to come up.  As I stood there waiting a car pulled up and a little old lady asked if my partner back there was going to be okay.  I responded, "As long as he's on his bike he should be fine."  Then I thought man Dad must look really bad when he's riding up a hill.  About 5 minutes later Dad pulled up and we had a good laugh at his expense.  After making out way through Sun City we headed down and around the hill and enjoyed one last ride without having to peddle.  Then it was a quick up and around back to McBean Park. 03:15 pm - We made it.  As we came down the side walk I asked a passerby to take a quick picture of us.  I stood there with a flood of memories from the day rushing back through, I made it, all 65 miles.  They may have closed down the course but I made it and so did my Dad.    Later that day I was able to get a hold of the other riders who started out with us in the morning and found that we were the only ones from our group that actually made the whole thing.  Most all of the other rides either didn't have enough left to finish the last loop through Sun City or they didn't realize there was one last loop.  Chris "Armstrong" Gale was just following the other riders and didn't have a map with him.  Instead of doing the whole 65 he only did 52.  When I told him there was another loop to do to make the 65 he felt cheated of the glory of finishing.  Of course he was done by 11:30 am, even doing all of the hills and the 52 miles he was done in no time at all.  If I was on my own I probably would have finished the route around 1:30 pm.  That's okay, next year I'll be back and I'll have that barbequed lunch yet!

As outlined in last journal we chill out end of every year for a week at Agnes Water/1770 which is no more than about an hour north of Bundaberg Qld Australia. It is the northernmost surf beach in Queensland because the Great Barrier Reef which starts just north of Agnes/1770 blocks surf for the rest of the way up the Queensland coast.  In recent emails I have been copping flak from Graham about "Agnes- does Coral know?" or words  to that effect!! Well yes Coral does know and she is with me and Agnes also- don't know whether that improves the situation or not!!    This time we decided to do the "beach thing" on a budget- Agnes Water Caravan Park was no longer taking cabin bookings as it was poised to be demolished and made into a resort so we opted to go economy and tow the refurbished caravan to Captain Cook Holiday Village. So my daily cycling routine has  changed. Previous years I simply rode from Agnes Water to 1770 right to the lookout on Round Hill and back.  MORNING RIDE- After a bright suggestion from the afore-mentioned nearest and dearest I created a circuit  heading back to Agnes Water township from the Village, turning right at the servo heading up the  hill out of town as far as Bicentennial Drive. Here I turned left and followed Endeavour Drive to the T-junction with Springs Road. Rather than just turn left back to town I opted to bulk out the distance by turning right and following that road as far as I could to the posh estates with the locked gates.       After a quick breather and a drink I then turned around and headed right back into town- once I reached the servo I had closed the loop and was returning back to 1770 the way I came. Around 23ks. Comfortable jaunt before brekky!!        EVENING RIDE- Some evenings I headed north to Round Hill lookout- good hill work-  reckon it would have to be a 10% grade. The sun setting over Bustard Bay was always  worth the push uphill. I know I usually averaged 50-55 ks/hr coming down!!          MIRIAM VALE-MT COLOSSEUM NATIONAL PARK Each hols I like to do one reasonable ride. This time I opted for Miriam Vale (rode there along the  railway line from Rosedale in May 2004- didn't realise that time I had ridden right past the access to Mt Colosseum National Park- well didn't realise I had ridden past Mt Colosseum!) so  determined to correct that deficiency this time around. I left the caravan park around 5.30 on Saturday heading out Round Hill Rd. . By 7.30 I was having a breather at Fingerboard servo- (well was Fingerboard servo until it closed). 36 ks and not too bad for me- I wasn't busting my boiler and also the new chain was slipping all the time so just took it easy.     One find was a two-year old Tour Australia road map atlas on the side of the road- obviously fallen off the roof of someone's vehicle- no identifying marks so I guess it is mine.    About 5 ks before Miriam Vale is the Lowmead turn which I reached I think by about 9.30 (should have written times down!!). It was an easy ride- apart from one tight stretch on old road with no shoulders- minimal traffic and gently undulating country. Lowmead Rd tad slower- what bitumen there was was very coarse and quite a deal of dirt so slow riding. About 5ks down this road is a Y-junction (think it was Wards Rd- only significant turn to the right across the railway line- can't miss it.) I stopped under the railway bridge for a while (good shade!!) and freed up some exposures on a rather full camera card! Then around other side of the railway line- and then heading west towards Mt Colosseum.    As I approached the mountain it was left turn again and into scrubbier country before coming out into grassy paddocks and farm over to the left. And getting annoyed because I could see the mountain in question slipping away behind me over my right shoulder!!      I was getting a tad apprehensive about the bike at this point but felt sure I was still headed in the right direction! At this point I seemed to be going down a small valley with the main hills to my right and low hills to my left separating me from the Lowmead Rd. This hut by the cattle yards I considered the ultimate retreat.         Been seen and conquered!! Would loved to have climbed Mt Colosseum but will have to wait until next time. Camp the night in Miriam Vale- get out there early with plenty of water and spend most of the day hiking and leave just enough time to get back to Miriam Vale before dark! In a remarkable piece of timing I was back out on Fingerboard Rd in enough time to make the Miriam Vale pub by 12 midday- incredible for me!! I was sailing along in fine style and only 2 ks from town when Coral caught up with me- chicken that I am I was quite happy just to hang the bike on the back of the car- I'd ridden this road already before!! 2005- Lowmead Pub down the Gorge Rd?? Time will tell!!       
   Even though I was told where it was, the place took me by surprise.  It is in the middle of a steep downhill on a turn, and I almost rode past it.  There it was:  The clunker bike which marks the cookie lady!    Show links to this Hide links to this         She welcomed me with a polite handshake and lots of warmth.  Signed her register, drank lemonade, and ate cookies.  Met the "cookie dad" too.    They have an amazing collection of cards covering the walls.  Newspaper and magazine clippings gave glowing accounts of the cookie lady's hospitality.    She took my picture with a polaroid and had me sign it.  Lots of bikers stay at her place.  I hung around enjoying myself for such a long time that she invited me to stay, but I needed to move on to keep my schedule.
The Ride According to a lifelong resident of Delphi, Indiana, the first sign of Spring isn't the robin arriving in Indiana! It's the site of a cyclist riding through Delphi with full touring kit, just passin' through! This year, that was me. The route I was following was a section of the Fort Wayne- Evansville route mapped out by Charlie Meyer, placed online for free for cyclists by the Wabash River Cycle Club at http://wrcc-in.org/routes/fortwayne-evansville.pdf and the map is quite good. The only thing it doesn't cover is terrain. The average vertical rise and drop of the route is +/- 200 feet and runs generally uphill along the Wabash River Valley if you ride the route toward Fort Wayne. The section I rode, From Lafayette to Logansport, and then back, is mostly along the river, or along the old Wabash-Erie Canal and is quite beautiful, even this early in the year. The Hay Bales North of Delphi, along the ride, I had a farmer with a load of hay in bales pass me. The wind gusted and blew several bales,(Yes, it was that windy!), off the top of the stack. Needless to say, they landed in the road, rolling every which way, including loose as the broke their baling wire binders! If you ever want to have your HR jump to MAXHR in a literal heartbeat, try dodging rolling, breaking up bales of hay on a loaded bike! Especially in a STRONG crosswind. The farmer was truly apologetic, and was worried that I was OK but hell, I dodged them, so no hit, no foul! I reassured him I was OK. Who would have thought the wind could have blown a bale off a truck, much less several? The Wind and the Calories If March comes in like a lion and goes out like a lamb, the end of March should be pretty nice! The wind was averaging 25-28 mph and gusting to 50! Unfortunately, it was a head wind most of the time. I figured the caloric burn and came up with 19,516 calories burned with an input of about 3000 calories. I'm not sure how accurate this output figure is, as I used the caloric burn engine averaging a 0.5% positive slope and a headwind of 28 mph as the variables. Is it even possible for someone to continue operating with a 16,000 calorie deficit without collapsing? I know I felt pretty weird at the end of the first day, runners high doesn't even cover it! All of my nerve endings were humming, and I actually felt a little detached from everything. No cognitive difficulties, but I was basically on the ragged edge. I had hit the BONK! I had planned to camp out for the night, but 1.I was so tired, I didn't even want to pitch a tent. If the weather wasn't going to go bad that evening, I'd have just rolled out the sleeping bag and mat. I was carrying a small portable radio and with the wind, and how the sky looked, I found the local AM station just in time to hear a severe thunderstorm warning. I opted for a motel!     2.I wanted a HOT shower and a Pollinex Massaging Showerhead almost badly enough to make a deal with the devil! I HURT! Surprisingly, it wasn't my butt or legs that hurt, (Those were this morning!), but my shoulders, neck and back! I can't imagine how I would have felt if I hadn't eaten 3 Clif Bars, 2 Zone Bars, and a Snickers, as well as a good breakfast, 2bottles of Gatorade, and at least 3.5 liters of good ol' H2O! Dinner was, of course, Tuna and Ramen Soup, and I wound up eating a second dinner an hour later(As soon as my stomach emptied!). One thing about post bariatric life is that if you need to take in a massive amount of fuel, you have to do it in deliberate stages when you have a stomach capacity of 6 OZ.! After Dinner, I was watching the Weather Channel, eating a bedtime snack of a Clif Bar(Yes, I was STILL HUNGRY, Blast it all!), seeing the continuing bad weather, and predicting snow for Tuesday, I decided to abort and head for home. The Tail Wind The forecast called for a NE wind and reasonable weather for the rest of the day, and then getting NASTY again last night. TAIL WIND, Cool! To take the best advantage of the tail wind I rode IN 25 from Logansport to Delphi. On my way through Logansport, I took a picture of a Stump Sculpture I had come across on the way through to go to the motel. I have a picture of it attached here to this post! I should also make the following statement to Burrows, Indiana: 'I hereby extend and apology to the residents of Burrows, Indiana for setting every dog in town, (All eight of them!) to barking at 8:00 on a Sunday morning!' All in all, everyone I met along the ride was pretty cool! The Homecoming! I got home about 4:15 PM, 53 miles in a bit over 6 hrs. Not bad for as heavy as my bike was! On arrival, I called my Aunt, who was the 'Designated Call of Shame Recipient' if I blew up on the ride and needed to be picked up and carted home! I was determined, though, that if I made that 'Call of Shame', it would be to pick me up from whatever hospital I landed in! Other than that eventuality, or a catastrophic bike failure, I was determined to pedal this trip under my own power! Here's a roughly paraphrased transcript of my call to my Aunt (Relevant portions only), to let her know I was home: My Aunt: Hi Tom! (Caller ID!) Me: Hi Aunt (Name Deleted to preserve her privacy), You are talking to one pooped cyclist My Aunt: How's it going then? Me: Well, my legs blew up, you're going to have to come pick me up! My Aunt: Where are you? I'll be there as quick as I can drive there! Me: About 6 inches from my front door! I made it home OK, Aunt (Name Deleted), I just couldn't resist! My Aunt: Unprintable,- Expletive deleted! Actually, I'm kidding on the last line from my Aunt, firstly, she's too much of a lady to say unprintable, and expletive deleted kind of things! She actually got a kick out of the 6 inches line! The Wife! On my arrival home, My wife did three things. First she helped me get the bike in! Then she gave me a hug.......and promptly said 'YOU STINK!' And then fed me some of the best tasting Chicken and Noodles I've ever tasted! It must have been bad, when she took my cycling jersey, shell and shorts to wash them, she was wearing a Racal biohazard level IV spacesuit! I should also mention that this is the first tour I have done in over twenty years and it felt great! This was signifigant in that on my departure date, it was the exact date and time, one year later that I had bariatric surgery. I didn't exactly plan it this way conciously, but it turned out to be pretty cool in itself! Over the last year, I have gone from being on oxygen, in a wheelchair, and weighing 581 pounds due to a pituitary disorder called Empty Sella Syndrome to an active touring cyclist again. I have dropped 581 pounds and am now doing unsupported tours of greater and greater duration. Additional rides are planned for this summer,after I get out of school for the semester so there will be more forthcoming! Keep pedaling!   
I had starting riding around the block in order to get a little healthier. That was a huge undertaking when the most extreme sport I had ever done was ten-pin bowling, where the bowling ball did all the hard work. Little by little the distance was added to, until I could at least travel out of town. It wasn't long before the back roads around town gave way to travelling to the next town, 30 kilometres away. I quickly rode out of my comfort zone and into an adventure. As the distance increased I noticed, that what I thought impossible was slowly becoming possible. It just took a different way of looking at it.  But still had 360 kilometres to travel to get to the alpine village of Tumbarumba on western side of the Snowy Mountains. Could I really ride that far? The answer came quicker than I wanted, as the date for departure was only around the corner. And with the rain coming down, I rode out of the driveway and into the unknown. But if you wish to travel without risk, you will never leave what is comfortable.  I had always done what others thought I could do, but now I was about to find out what I was able to do. With cries of 'you' won't make it' still ringing in the wet mist, I rode out into the distance. The great thing about the unknown is you don't have any preconceived ideas of what you can and can't do. I didn't know about the pain I would feel in the legs as they cranked the pedals over the hills with a laden bicycle moving     forward. Then someone in the next town said 'How bout the mountains?', what mountains?, now I know it said Snowy Mountains, but it never really sunk in that I would be riding up mountains.     The world of cycle touring sees the world at one turn of the pedals at a time. So it was just a matter of  pedals turning, and in time the kilometres passed. The weather cleared and adventure was had. Little did I know that the road, instead of ending in the mountains, would open up to more adventures. 
My friend Josh, brother Dave and i jumped on the New Jersey turnpike on saturday and headed north.  After checking into our hotel room, about 15 miles south of NYC, we decided to make a trip into the city to walk around, plan our route into the city and find a place to park on sunday.     The wake up call came at 5:30 am and we were on the road by 6.  Very little traffic this early on a sunday had us in the city by 6:45 and parked by 7.  So far so good.   A little bit about the ride...this was the 20 somethingth annual 5 boro bike ride, and they were expecting up to 30,000 riders.  The route started just north of Battery Park in lower Manhattan and went up the Avenue of the Americas through Central Park, to Harlem, about a mile in the Bronx and back into Manhattan, then to Queens and Brooklyn and finally across the Verazano bridge finishing on Staten Island.  The route is about 42 miles and the roads are close the whole way.   We rode our bikes down to Battery park and looked at the Statue of Liberty and then headed to the start.  The ride officially starts at 8am and people begin lining up as early as 6am.  We were about 10 blocks south of the actual start and didn't begin riding until 9am.  (that many people in front of us)          We finally got started and after about 10 blocks, we finally reached the official start....42 miles to go...    We began the ride with a leisurely ride up the Avenue of the Americas, taking our time to enjoy the sights.  It was very nice having the right of way the entire time, not worrying about being smashed by crazed taxis.    The Avenue of the Americas is about 4 or 5 lanes wide and the road/path through Central Park is only about 2 lanes wide.  Someone gave this some thought and decided that it would be best to let smaller groups enter the park in intervals.  While is sucks when you are waiting 45 minutes to get into the park, it would have been worse to let us fend for ourselves.    Once in Central Park, we all seemed to move as one large mass, not enough room to go around slower riders and i was waiting for a pile up at any moment.  We did pass one rider who recently had a spill, but we were able to avoid any problems.  He must have caught a whiff of Rusty and his "Beef-a-Reeno".  Joe Pepitone did a great job on the park....We exited Central Park and made our way across Harlem, on our way to the Bronx.    What is a bike ride without a flat tire.  This time it was Josh with the flat.  While Josh put a new tube in and put air in the tire, we answered questions from curious people passing by.  You get interesting looks when you tell them you are riding 42 miles in New York.  "There are taxis that go much faster..." After a quick stay in the Bronx, we made our way back to Manhattan and our first rest stop.  Didn't really need the stop except to use the spot o pots.  No woods around NYC to take care of nature's callings and the winos seem to have the alleys spoken for.    In the tour de france the mountains are categorize by the length and steepness.  An "hors categorie" climb is off the charts, the most difficult there is.  Every slight rise in the road would cause people to get off their bikes and walk, until the marshals yelled over the bullhorns reminding them it was Bike New York, not Hike New York.  Begrudgingly, they would mount their bikes and huff and puff their way to the top of the overpass.            After finishing the ice cream it was back on the bikes and through Brooklyn to the Verazano bridge.    The Verazano bridge was the last major climb before most of the people could put their bike back in the basement until next year.    Once on Staten Island, we had to make our way over to the Staten Island ferry to get back to Manhattan.  The wait wasn't too bad, about 30 minutes.    Once back in Manhattan, we had to make our way back to the car.  The city is in the process of building a nice multiuse path around the entire island.  Its a great way to get around without dealing with traffic.    We made it back to the car, changed and went around the corner to get burritos and margaritas!  It was a good day to see the city.   
  Burnham-Ward Lakefront Vision Ride, was a Free 2-Hour Bike Ride Exploring the Storied History and Hopeful Future of Chicago's Open and Free Lakefront on Sunday afternoon, June 6th, 2004.   Chicagoans can thank our forebears for bequeathing the city a largely uncluttered lakefront.   But unfortunately, today an 8-lane superhighway separates Chicago from a truly free and clear shoreline. A growing movement to eliminate the pollution, dangers and unsightliness by de-paving Lake Shore Drive is working to fulfill the lakefront promises of Chicago's forefathers.   On June 6, cyclists joined Chicago's premiere Daniel Burnham and Montgomery Ward impersonators for the Lakefront Vision Ride, a leisurely tour to learn about our lakefront's legacy directly from those who created it and to plot a future course for a free Chicago shoreline. New this year will be a cameo appearance by Cap Streeter.   "The Vision Ride is a fun way to educate Chicagoans about our vibrant lakefront history," said Jim Redd, who plays Daniel Burnham on the ride. "Today, we have a beautiful, open lakefront because courageous people throughout Chicago's history have been willing to fight for what's right. Now, the future's up to us."   The ride is sponsored by the Campaign for a Free and Clear Lakefront, a grass roots coalition working to remove Lake Shore Drive from Grant Park and eventually from the entire length of the Chicago shoreline.    More info at www.ForeverFreeandClear.org.   I almost didn't go.  From where I live on the northwest side of Chicago (North Park) it's down Elston Avenue - a diagonal street leading downtown with a bike lane - but boring.  Instead, I chose Lincoln Avenue, another diagonal street without a bike lane the whole length but much more interesting.  However, I think I got stopped by every red light on the way!        We began to assemble downtown Chicago, in the shadow of the Picasso Statue in Daley Plaza shortly before noon.  An inauspicious start: someone had a flat, and I offered the use of my CO2 pump - except I had never put the cartridge in and didn't know how to use it! I'd better put that on the list of things to do before I go off and do any touring this summer.           Shortly after noon, we took off, riding in a surprisingly civilized manner, usually taking only one lane.  There were about 30 of us in the group.     Our first item of interest was at the southeast corner of Lake & Wacker, former location of the Sauganash Tavern, Chicago's first tavern - where Chicago was incorporated in 1833.    Next, we stopped at the southwest corner of Lake & Clark streets, which was where the First Presbyterian Church was located.  It was at this church that a public resolution was passed on November 2, 1835, resolving that the Fort Dearborn land be retained as a public space 'accessible at all times to the people.'       We rode by Michigan and Wacker, Fort Dearborn in 1803. We passed by Kinzie & Wabash, Jean Baptiste Point du Sable's house, who was the first permanent settler.            We stopped and trespassed on 'Cap' Streeter's land, where the Hancock Building is located.  'This here's my land.  I built it' claimed Cap.  There is some legitimacy to the claim - the land plat at the time shows where the shoreline ended, and the rest is landfill which Cap encouraged and promoted to 'build' his land.             Next, Oak & Michigan, where Lakeshore Drive ended until 1933.  Had it not been extended the entire land south of this point would have been open parkland. At Michigan and Randolph was Dearborn Park, the first public square established in 1835.   No tour would be complete without visiting the new Millennium Park.  In addition to a (car) parking lot, there will be a bicycle parking lot as well, complete with showers, parking, minor repairs.                  At the corner of Michigan and Madison we viewed the building originally build by Montgomery Ward for his business. This location was formerly known as The Levee, and known for 'the ladies of the Levee' where notables like Alderman 'Hinky Dink' Kenna described it as a place where 'joy reigns supreme' and that 'Chicago ain't no sissy town.'         We also saw the Art Institute, the only permanent structure in Grant Park.  Although this violated the 'forever free and clear' dictum, it has been agreed to by the businessmen of Michigan Avenue - because they thought it would be good for business.       Monroe and Lake Shore Drive was where the drive ended until 1933.  The Outer Drive was consistent with Burnham's vision of a scenic road for accessibility TO the parks, not THROUGH them! Under the Campaign for a Free and Clear Lakefront's plan this would be the northern boundary of a car-free Grant Park.    At Buckingham Fountain, Queen's Landing, we timed the crosswalk: cars got the green light for almost two minutes; pedestrians were allotted about 45-second to cross eight lanes of traffic.           In 2005, this crosswalk was eliminated!  Pedestrians must now walk a considerable distance to cross the roadway, Queen's Landing and Buckingham Fountain are significant cultural and historical landmarks, visited by thousands of visitors and locals each year.  Evidently the 8-lanes of car traffic are of more importance.    Note added in June of 2006  From this point, we headed north to the end of our tour, at Cancer Survivor's Park.  This is where Lake Shore Drive was before the S-curve was straightened out, and example of how green space can be liberated from asphalt.          >>> Part 2 of this page 
We took the Emerald Isle guided day tour for $79 each, since it was the cheapest price I could find.  You can check all the different companies doing the ride at http://www.tombarefoot.com/maui/bike_maui.html  They picked us up at our condo about 7am, showed us a short video at the office, then drove us up to the top of the mountain.  All the way up the mountain, our tour guide, Bob, kept us in stitches with his terrible (but funny) jokes.  We passed a few dedicated riders who were biking to the top on road bikes.  It didn't look like fun. On the way up, at a pullout above the treeline, we stopped for a breakfast of muffins and coffee, and took pictures of the great view of Maui, with Molokai and Lanai across the channel.  I'll attach a couple pictures if Wen ever finds the roll of film and gets it developed!  While we were enjoying the view, we were passed by many other guided cycling groups on their way downhill.  They'd all got up at 2am, driven to the top and watched the sunrise before heading downhill after daylight.  Standing in the cold and dark at 10,000' for 4 hours before the ride made me very glad we chose the day tour instead of the sunrise tour.  We continued up the mountain and entered the gates of the National Park.  The road continues up for another 10 miles to the crater overlook and visitor center.  If you do a self-guided tour, you must start outside the park boundary.  Only guided tours can ride within the park. After taking in the spectacular view of the crater and dodging the Japanese tourists, we put on our gear and got our bikes.  Most of the people in our group of 12 or so hadn't been on a bike in a couple months (if then).  We wore dirt bike helmets, a jacket and gloves, all provided by the tour company.  The bikes are specially made for this route.  They are modified 1-speed beach cruisers that weigh about 45 lbs and have drum brakes on both front an rear wheels.  Very stable at speed, with big wide seats.  Bob pointed out that these bikes were much more stable and safe on the downhill run than your average lightweight road bike.  A couple turns around the parking lot, then we were ready to go.   Bob put us in order, with the lightest (and cutest) rider right behind him (Wendy), and successively heavier riders following, with the biggest guy at the end.  We were given instructions to keep our position in the order, and keep constant spacing behind the rider ahead of us.  Bob also explained a few hand signals, and what we would do to let following vehicles pass us.  The van followed behind us as a SAG, communicating with Bob via radio, and blocking overtaking traffic.  Then we took off down the mountain.  Whoa!  It was steep, and we picked up speed fast.  About 3 miles down there is a sharp left.  Bob called a halt, lined us up again and showed us the cliff below the turn.  The Park Service has every group stop at this turn because too many riders didn't negotiate the turn at speed and went airborne off the cliff.  It was a nice break, where we all caught our breath, relaxed a little, and got ready for the rest of the trip.  We were very lucky with the weather.  Sometimes the summit is wreathed in clouds, so you are rolling down in cold and fog, but for our trip, it was clear, sunny and warm.  Then we were off again, screaming downhill on switchback after switchback.  The map of the route is at http://tinyurl.com/7a5hf We stopped for lunch at the Sunrise Protea Flower Farm in Kula.  We'd done the first 20 miles in less than an hour.  Lunch was provided, and you had your choice of sandwiches or salads, all good.  They had a wide variety of Proteas growing in the garden.  They are big, strange, showy flowers. http://www.sunriseprotea.com/  After lunch, we headed on downhill.   Six miles later, just outside the town of Makawao, we had to stop, load the bikes in the trailer and jump in the van for a detour through the town.  There was some road construction, but I think it was also because the townspeople don't like all the bike tourists.  At this point, the flakey Aussie realized he'd left his fanny pack with wallet, money and camera at the lunch stop.  Bob called them, and his pack had been found and was in safekeeping.  Since we had to drive back up there, we all voted to repeat the ride down from there, so it turned out OK.   The drive up seemed to take a lot longer than the ride down! On the outskirts of Makawao, we remounted our bikes and headed down Baldwin Ave for the last leg of the trip.  We rode through the small town of Paia and turned left onto the Hana Highway.  A little further on was our last stop, at a beach park.  We all walked out to the beach to take a few pictures, then got back in the van for the ride back to the office.  From there they drove us back to our condo, arriving about 4pm. This is a fun ride, with great views, and you don't have to be a cyclist to enjoy it - I don't think I had to pedal more than a few times in the whole trip.  I liked the convenience of the hotel pick up and delivery, and that breakfast and lunch were included, as were all the clothing and equipment, including bikes.  I hope you have a great time, too. 
There are lots of intriguing routes in the DC area - check http://bikewashington.org - but I'd promised myself when I did the "W&ODCO" route last year that I would do the Mount Vernon Trail.  Wendy is a new cyclist, and, although she's enthusiastic and athletic, she hadn't had much time to practice.  A couple weeks before this trip we had coasted 40+ miles down Haleakala in Maui, but that hardly counts as practice.   The Mount Vernon Trail starts on Theodore Roosevelt Island in DC, crosses over to Arlington, VA and then follows the Virginia bank of the Potomac past National Airport and "Olde Town" Alexandria to Mount Vernon 18 miles away.  I didn't think Wen could handle a 36-mile round trip, so I decided to start in Alexandria.  We'd briefly toured there last year and it looked much more historic and quaint than Arlington and Rosslyn. On Monday we drove from Baltimore via a sightseeing stop at Annapolis, MD to Alexandria, VA where we checked into the Travelodge.  It turned out to be a nice motel across the street from a "Trader Joe's" and within walking distance of old town.  We walked down to Big Wheel Bikes to see what rentals they had, and arrange for tomorrow's trip. Tuesday morning we were up late - the shop didn't open till 11am.  Stopped at the taqueria across the street for breakfast burritos, then drove to the bike shop.  I found that the trail is paved all the way, so we picked out bikes with skinny tires.  The shop is 1 block away from the trail, so we were out of there and on our way by 11:40am.  A map of our route is at http://tinyurl.com/7k7sw It was a sunny day with temperatures in the 80's.  I was dismayed that I'd left my sunscreen behind and worried about getting sunburned.  But not a chance, the trail goes through the woods and is shaded for most of the way.   We stopped for a water break at a park just south of Alexandria, where we had a chat with a runner who was also taking a break.  It's a small world.  He has a son in Kula, Maui, which we'd just visited two weeks before, and he is planning to come out to my town of Scottsdale, AZ for the "Rock and Roll Marathon" in January. Although the trail stays close to the shore of the river, and thus is fairly flat, Mount Vernon is aptly named.  GW put his house on the top of a hill    with a magnificent view to the north overlooking the Potomac.     As we made the winding climb for the last couple miles to the house, I realized that I hadn't rented a lock with the bikes.  Once again, I was worried about nothing.  The main gate is familiar with this problem, and has a stock of bike locks that they'll rent you for a dollar.  We paid our entrance fees, locked up the bikes, and went on a tour of the grounds.  There are warning signs up that they reserve the right to search your bags, but they didn't bother to check my backpack. We got some stares from the other tourists as we were decked out in our bike shorts and jerseys.    We spent a couple hours in the grounds and took the tour through the house.  It was a Tuesday afternoon and luckily for us, there were no lines.  On the tour I learned two interesting things: the house is made of wood, painted and grooved to look like stone, and George Washington died of asphyxiation due to swelling of his throat in a short, acute illness.  If they'd known to do a tracheotomy, he "would be alive today";)   The pear trees in the garden were loaded with pears, but I couldn't find the cherry tree he'd cut down.  On our way out we stopped for a drink at the new snack bar and browsed the gift shop.  I was looking to buy a jar of cherry jam from the tree George chopped down, but they didn't have any.  Sounds to me like a great marketing opportunity missed. After we turned in our rented bike lock, we headed for home.  When we stopped to take some photos, Wendy remarked that the ride home was a lot easier than the ride there.       For one thing, the first couple miles were downhill, and on the return, we were familiar with the route.   Before long, we were back at the bike shop to return the bikes.  I told the shopkeeper that it had been perfect weather for the ride, and the only problem was that the route was too short.  He told me we could have extended the round trip by 6 miles by continuing to George Washington's Gristmill three miles West of Mount Vernon http://www.dcr.virginia.gov/parks/georgewa.htm.  Oh, well, something for next time.    Resource: "Mount Vernon Trail, George Washington Memorial Parkway" in Bicycle Touring 
I wound up starting out just before sunrise, I wanted to get some miles in before the traffic got hairy. Temp was 54 degrees with a light fog. It felt COLD! The entire ride was done against a headwind varying between 10 and 15 mph. As the day progressed, the clouds and light fog burned off into a glorious sunny afternoon with 69 degrees as a high. I hit the wall about the 90 mile point and was getting pretty discouraged, but decided to continue after the wife reminded me I didn't have to do this if I didn't want to, that it was fine if I quit (Man, I hate it when she uses that word, it's a spur in the ol' side if ya know what I mean! ) I ran through a couple of really nice towns (Townships?) around the west side of North Manchester. One was called Ijamsville, and the other was Lakewood. The Lakewood FD was out and offered me water and Gatorade, nice guy's! I was using primarily liquid nutrition this ride and my sugars held up really well! I did get close to bonking, and that's why I was a bit discouraged. I pushed a bit too hard, I think, but still made it. This was a new high mileage day for me. It feels great, and I'm still feeling pretty trashed, but recovering well. Hydration went well and I hit Syracuse hungry as a bear! All evening and most of today, I've been nibbling and drinking fluids. MY average speed was 14.52 MPH. Not bad for an old middleaged fart! http://xs306.xs.to/xs306/06370/ridepic.jpg.xs.jpg http://xs306.xs.to/xs306/06385/SpandexButt.jpg.xs.jpg Click on the links to get the images as I can't seem to get them uploaded!

Yesterday was a soaker.  The red cliffs around Moab sprang rust colored waterfalls all around.  Rivers ran where before I had seen only desert.  The ground was soaked. If this keeps up, Canyonlands National Park will merge with Grand Canyon and Arches will erode to a pile of red gravel. Overhead was gray to black just before sunrise but the full moon looked through a wide clearing in the western sky. Would I even go on this ride? Moab Century Tour is a charity event benefiting the Lance Armstrong Foundation held each October in Moab, Utah.  Of the three ride venues, I had chosen the 65 mile route up into the LaSal Mountains.  This route gains about a thousand feet in the first 21 miles and then turns viscious with 'The Big Nasty', a 7 mile stretch that climbs another 3000 plus.      I had tried this route two years earlier on my Tour Easy, a long wheelbase recumbent bicycle.  It whipped my tail.  I walked the early steeper grades and eventually opted to take the SAG wagon to the summit.  This time, I brought my Greenspeed recumbent trike.  If my Tour Easy performs like a Bentley, the trike is my Hum V.   Knowing I would not be speedy, I had considered starting on the route before the mass start at 8:00 AM.  It is a ride, not a race, so early starts are okay.  That is why I was up before the sun that morning.  But, the dark skies delayed the morning light and I did not consider it safe to ride without lights until about 7:45.  Riding past the starting point, I decided to fall in with the rest of the riders at the mass start.  Following the usual opening comments and introduction of dignitaries, the ride started officially at about 8:10.  I should have gone early.  Pedaling my low-slung trike at wheel and leg level, I worked my way to the street.  The pack followed a police escort up Main Street to downtown where it turned off east and spread out a little.  I read the grade as a steady 2 to 4 percent on my GPS but without reliable vertical and horizontal references, it looked level.  Another recumbent cycle, a white Tour Easy Gold Rush, passed me like it was on auxiliary power.  I did not see it again.  The sun remained behind the clouds lingering over the mountains but the rest of the sky was definitely clearing. The first of the aid stations consisted of water cans and Porta-Potties.  I waited in line about ten minutes with other cyclists anxious to off-load their morning coffee.  On the road again, the first steep grade came into view winding up the side of a bluff (cliff).  This piece made a pedestrian of me the last time I was here. Swinging around a right angle turn, I dropped the trike into its absolute granny gear and slid into turtle mode.  Speed dropped to 2 miles per hour but I was pedaling, not walking.  It was about one half mile of 15 percent grade called 'The Little Nasty.'  Regular bikes passed me, the riders huffing above my low-riding trike.  I smiled.  I was not huffing.  I was slow but not breathless.   The second aid station was atop that grade.  While I rehydrated and wolfed down a cookie and fruit, I saw some riders starting down the hill I just climbed, heading back to Moab.  Others queued to bus to the summit with their bikes in the SAG trailer.  The cycle traffic was much thinner as the next leg began.  A mile or two of 4 to 6 percent slope preceded the start of Big Nasty proper.  Rounding a corner, I saw the road ahead slicing up the side of the mountain, a long constant 14 to 15 percent grade.  Back into turtle mode now.  Several people were walking their bikes; others were doing an uphill slalom from one road edge to another, trading distance for slope.  Everybody was pretty quiet.    The Big Nasty continues like that with short interludes of 5 to 6 percent grades that looked like downhill by comparison and made me want to coast.  After about 4 miles, the way became rolling for about a mile before the next aid station at 8000 feet.   This station had plenty of water and food but only four cyclists in attendance.  The pack had thinned out and I was near the back, if not dead last.  Volunteers were packing up and getting ready to move out.  With a quick cup of water, I remounted.   There followed about a mile and a half of downhill.  I had not heard the whizzing of my brake disk rotors for a long time.  It sounded good.    What goes down must climb back up another long 15 percent grade back to 8000 feet and a longer rolling ascent to the summit at 8300 feet.  Twenty-eight road miles in about 5 hours. Add to that, four fifths of a mile in vertical elevation gain.   The summit aid station overlooked Castle Valley, a broad expanse marked by a number of red rock spires like the battlements of a castle.  It is a beautiful place and were it not for the proximity of Arches and Canyonlands National Parks, this valley would, in all likelihood be designated a national reserve of some sort.  But this part of Utah has an embarrassment of natural beauty so, Castle Valley remains and overlooked treasure on a byway.   Clouds gathered over the nearby peaks while the sun warmed the valley below.  Eight thousand feet of elevation chilled the air.  Bundled in a fleece vest and wind jacket, I made for the valley floor.  The road, while paved, was rough and marked with sharp switchbacks.  Pumping the brakes I leaned into turns as one must do on a trike.  It was a fairly solitary decent.  A van with volunteers and equipment from the previous, now closed, aid station passed me.  Along a straight and gentle decline in the lower valley, a woman cyclist passed me pumping and breathing hard.  My cyclocomputer read 32 miles per hour and I was just coasting.  Heavy recumbents are always faster than ordinary bikes on the downhill.  I let her go, luxuriating in my gravity assisted descent.  The road out of Castle Valley T-bones into the highway that parallels the Colorado River.  Five hours to climb The Big Nasty; one hour back down.  After a pause to shed some high altitude insulation, I fell in with riders who were finishing the century course.   The Colorado River, swollen with runoff, looked more like mudflow than a river.  Despite this, the way was gorgeous, winding along the river's edge with sheer, red rock cliffs rising to 500 feet on each side.  But, I was tired and contemplating the 20 mile ride back to town (the last 5 miles in Moab traffic) I settled into survivor mode and could not appropriately appreciate the beauty around me.  A car pulled along side me.  Through the window, my wife called, 'Are you all right.'  I signaled, 'Yes,' but she pulled off to the side of the road a little way ahead.  Stopping behind her I got off the trike experiencing a new sensation - muscle soreness.  I have been weak and spent from tough rides before but never sore.   Leaning on my arms above her open window, I announced, 'I am very able to finish this ride.'   'I know you are,' she replied.   I went on, 'But you are a sight for sore eyes.'   Without a trace of guilt or disappointment, I loaded the trike into our Outback.   The Big Nasty is one of those challenges that I wanted to surmount.  It is done.  I cannot imagine what would induce me to do it again.  But, you never know.

My "Bike Rides Around Sydney" book features a Hornsby-Gosford ride along the old Pacific Highway, which has long been supplanted by the Sydney-Newcastle Freeway. The in-laws live in Newcastle, and on our infrequent visits we pass by the signs on the freeway saying "Bicycles - Take Old Pacific Highway" scenic route. The "Bike Rides" book labels the route as "difficult", which had been intimidating me a little, but after riding the Sydney-to-the-Gong ride a few weekends ago without trouble, I decided I was up to it.      I set out from home at about 8:30 on Friday morning - the last day of my week off. A fine day, not too windy, not too warm, a step up from the previous day, which had been an unseasonably cool 10 degrees C and littered with showers.  I live near the airport, about 10kms from Sydney's Central Station, where I catch the train out to Hornsby to start the ride: on an all-stations service, it's about an hour's journey. I buy my ticket just after 9am, neatly avoiding having to purchase a peak hour half-fare ticket for my bike.    By 10am, I'm at Hornsby Station and ready to go: down Jersey Street, avoiding the witches hats (most of Sydney's roads seem to be under construction at the moment - end of year budget to be spent?), and thence onto the Highway. The first part of the journey follows the train line, past Mount Kuring-gai Station, and a wide bike path means no need to play in traffic.  Suburban houses and shops, P platers with no sense of direction, and a completely random sight. A white horse, standing on the footpath outside someone's home.    Just before Cowan, the multi-lane road turns into the new Freeway, taking most of the traffic with it, and I follow the old Highway to the left.  Little do I realise that the junction has a guardian. I hear the whoosh and flutter of wings just behind my head, and the angry screech of a territorial magpie, and feel my muscles tense in anticipation of impact. Fortunately it doesn't come. The next few hundred metres are punctuated with these swooping attacks, but I think he's more interested in driving off the intruder than inflicting any injury; I remain untouched. It does make me anxious, though: what if the entire route is going to be like this? That could make for a very long day, and I can't count on getting off unscathed every time. As it turns out, though, this is an isolated incident. A few kilometres further on, I stop at a cafe to get an iceblock. I've been cycling for about an hour, and though I'm still perfectly comfortable, I figure taking a little break is probably still a sensible option. I buy myself a Frosty Fruit (mmm, tropical ice goodness), and sit down in the shade to eat it. Shortly thereafter, another cyclist arrives from the north on a road bike and wanders in to buy himself an icypole. He says hi, and we talk about the ride to Gosford, which he seems to have done quite frequently: he recommends turning off the highway at Brisbane Water and riding on to Woy Woy Station as a more scenic option than braving downtown Gosford. He's also familiar with the magpie guardian I'd encountered down the road: he says that the bird has been menacing that section of road for years, and they've spoken to the ranger about it. Apparently magpies have a hierarchy, and it's the job of the alpha male to do all the diving and swooping; take the alpha away, and a new one will take its place. Magpies as hydras, who knew? Onwards and upwards! The book had mentioned wide shoulders, but in many places the encroaching leaf litter from the surrounding bushland has overtaken all but a few inches of asphalt on the left side of the white line. In other places, the shoulder is broken and cracked, or riddled with seams. It seems best to ride to the left of the lane, where the road surface is halfway decent. Then downwards... The highway snakes back and forth as it descends the mountain, which makes it very popular with motorcyclists. There's a motorbike passing me every few minutes. I'm coasting down the hills without much in the way of pedalling, which I'd say would make me lazy except that I know I'm going to pay for it on the way up the other side.    More workmen: they're working on the road surface on the north side of the Peats Ferry Bridge, and the traffic is down to a single lane. Unlike the cars, who have to wait for the lollipop man to point the "Slow" sign their way, I can just cycle along the pathway on the left hand side of the bridge and out the other side.    There are workers on the footpath on the other side, and they wave me to a halt, worried that I won't stop for them. They're wearing hi-vis clothing and helmets - I can't imagine that they'd think I hadn't seen them. I hop back onto the road shoulder, and continue northwards.    I stop for lunch at a service station that no longer serves petrol, at a place called Peats Island. There are picnic tables beside it, and I buy myself a bottle of Dare iced coffee and a Vegemite sandwich and go sit down at one of the tables to eat. The ducks I'd noticed lounging in the shade now approach me with purpose: clearly they've discovered the picnic ground is an easy source of food.      The female duck has a lot in common with my beagle: a little nose - or in this case, beak - appears from under the table like a periscope and demands food. I have a lot of experience in resisting this sort of mealtime begging, and no food is forthcoming. The duck, again very much like the beagle, settles down under the table to sulk. And fish for crumbs.    The other inhabitant of the picnic ground is a rainbow lorikeet, also used to humans as lunchtime providers. It hops onto the table and noses around my helmet and gloves, which are sitting before me. It's not quite bold enough to hop onto my hand, but it's literally right at my fingertips. It doesn't get any sandwich either. From here on to Mt White is 10kms, uphill. I drop into a good hill-climbing gear (though my chain is rattling; it needs some TLC) and plug away. It's not hard, as long as I remember to let the bike do the work and not my muscles - "mechanical advantage doesn't get tired, dimwit!" - just time-consuming.     I switch my bike computer from the clock mode to the odometer so I can watch the metres tick by. Slow and steady. A roadie on a Specialized whizzes by; I am hillslug, hear me roar. It flattens out and I find a patch of shoulder wide enough to pull over, take a drink, stamp my feet a few times. My hands and feet are doing nicely, though: no pins and needles, no hotfoot. I have a muesli bar, and I'm still chewing when I hop back into the saddle. A motorcyclist zooms past, and waves to me. I'm too slow to wave back: he's already out of sight.      I reach the Road Warriors Cafe, which seems to be where all these motorcyclists have been heading. There's at least a dozen parked out the front, while their riders sit and enjoy a coffee. I consider getting a latte, but I'm not sure my stomach would thank me for it at this point. I get a bottle of cold water from the fridge, top up my bottles, inhale the rest.    There are some middle-aged folks sitting in the shade near the bike racks, with their small dogs. Two of them are white and fluffies, and one is a dachshund type of some description. They're not motorcyclists; perhaps they're on their way somewhere else? One of the fluffies is being cuddled and lavished with attention. The others are romping, albeit lazily, under the table. I'm about to hop back on my bike again and be on my way, when I catch sight of the flowers at the side of the road. I stop to take some photographs: they're too pretty to pass up.      From the cafe to the T-junction at Calga takes no time at all. The highway turns right and then right again; a truck driver stops to wave me on through at the intersection.    And now it's downhill to Mooney Mooney Creek. Strangely, the only photo I have of this portion of road is taken on an uphill slope. But really, who wants to stop for photos when they can be cruising down this winding road?    I flash by the Mooney Mooney Creek sign and am halfway across the bridge before I think to stop. The book has warned me that there's another big climb coming - I'll soon be looking down at the freeway that I can see above and to my left. I wheel my bike back to the sign for a photo.      The uphills continue to be, if not effortless, strangely easy. I think perhaps that tell-tale word "difficult" was psyching me out more than I knew. I haven't even needed to resort to my old faithful hill-climbing chant: I think I can, I think I can. Or perhaps I'm just fitter than I used to be.    I pass the Australian Reptile Park, but no more Old Sydney Town. We used to come out here for school excursions, way back when. It feels a lot drier along this stretch of road than earlier in the trip: microclimate? imagination? or am I becoming dehydrated? I chug down half a bottle of water, just in case it's the latter. Travelling through Somersby Industrial Park would be incredibly unscenic, if it weren't for the same yellow flowers I saw at Road Warriors Cafe, here growing in ridiculous profusion along both sides of the road. It's probably a weed, and the locals despair of it, but it's gorgeous. As I descend towards Gosford - down a twisting winding road with hairpin bends and no shoulder to speak of - the flowers are brilliant yellow around me. If I have to bail out suddenly, at least they'll make for a soft landing. No chance for a photo here! On the last few bends the flowers give way to gum trees and gravel, and then I'm spat out near the sign for West Gosford. Looking back, the last hundred metres of the road - all that's visible - look innocuous.    From here it's all mundane. I cheat along the footpath for a hundred metres to where the bus lane starts, then coast on past the Gosford Racecourse, Henry Kendall High School, and down an absurdly steep street to Gosford station.    It's a twenty minute wait for the train, and then I'm on my way home.
Success! I caught the bus right in time that ran me out to The Brecksville VA hospital. I rested up on the bus after my high speed dash to downtown, unloaded, my gear, and headed out for Silver Springs Lake Park in Stow Ohio. The sun came out of it's hiding, and finally reached around 68 degrees with a nice cool breeze. I headed out toward Boston Mills Ski Resort Area via Snowville to Riverview roads. Had some hot soup at pine picnic area next to boston mills ski resort before continuing on to Peninsula Ohio. Somewhere along the way my oversized water bottle had fallen out of it's cage!  Arrived in downtown Peninsula without a problem, and a local bike shop sold me a water bottle, and let me fill it with some fresh spring water they had their at the store.  I continued up route 303 east a huge hill to the Summit County Bike n Hike entrance, the red blazes glowing in the sun, it was a picture perfect day for a bike ride, just perfect. The trail was real smooth, nicely paved , and covered with leaves.  The trail had very little traffic on it making it really peaceful. On occasion you'd see a smiling jogger, cyclist, or walker greeting you everyone was soaking up the great weather.  The bike trail lead me right to the  Silver Springs Park in Stow ohio. I roamed around this really well kept city owned park for a bit then continued on to the campgrounds further down the trail.  Rolled up this driveway entrance to the park less than a mile from the trail to see a lake, these little cottages each with their own names. A saw a deer beside one of them from the parking lot when I heard a snap, a sound I was all too familiar with (a broken spoke).  Wouldn't you know I forgot something pretty important when I rushed to pack up and get out - fibre fix spokes. The sun was half way down, and I knew I would be running out of daylight soon. I'm fortunate that my brakes have a quick release so I could ride with the rear brake open preventing this really wobbly rim from rubbing the brake on my return ride home.  I wobbled down the trail just as fast as I could, I didn't feel the wobble as bad at a high speed. It was getting late, and now the deers were starting to come out, they stood next to the trail many times, sometimes you'd hear them but not see them. I feared one of them jumping out in front of me like one time before.  I was really pushing it, and my legs started cramping from over doing things so I slowed down, stopped rested and got out some energy bars to eat along the way. I didn't want to take any chances bonking on the way back. I finally arrived at brandywine falls a halfway home point. I found that occasionally walking the bike helped relieve my leg pain by using different muscles.  I continued wobbling up until I reached the end of the trail at Alexander Rd. also known as Pleasant Valley Road. It leads to the Cuyahoga Valley National Park, and towpath. The tow path runs pretty much parrelel to the path I took but has a much rougher surface to ride than the Hike n Bike path . The towpath has alot more shade to offer in the hot summer months than the hike n bike which is a converted railway trail that runs under high voltage lines, and is pretty much wide open. I arrived in Independence, stopped in a local Pizza shop and ordered a huge meatball sub, and had a feast. The valuable lesson I learned is Be Prepared for emergency repairs, Leave yourself enough time, and always try to plan things in advance.                       
I felt great an hour ago. But riding hard without enough fuel in the belly or water to keep you going is like running on empty. I could imagine the headlines, 'Man found babbling out his mind and near death!'; well may be my imagination is in overdrive or not really all there in the first place.  After all, it was only going to be a short ride. Well it would be short by ambulance to the hospital with a drip hanging out my arm. Isn't that what they do with elite athlete's who hit the dreaded wall after the bonk!  Well I was no athlete with back up support crew ready to treat first-aid on me. So what could I do? Looking like a crazed zombie, I made my way to the nearest farm house and knocked on the door. It was only then I notice the salivating Blue-Heeler. 'Oh, he won't bite, he always greets that way. Come in the Billy's on', he waved. I hadn't spoken a word; a warm drink already had my name on it. The tea went down smoother then a cappuccino might have. I usually baulk at drinking liquid tar, but the spring water it was brewed from sweetened the taste. Jack was a true bushy, an old timer sleeper cutter. Silver hair accentuating his deep features. He mumbled something and with that, an elderly woman appeared with a tray of scones. Nellie was the image of a rough diamond, dressed in a flannel shirt and moleskins. 'I really didn't expect this kind of help and hospitality'. Now Nellie was showing me her cast cooking pots while Jack told stories of cutting sleepers by hand tools and experiences they shared on the track cutting and cooking in the bush. Even Jack's hands told a story - of skin cracking working out in shrub during cool winters and freezing rain under the cover of a canvas swag. My high-tech camping gears from the city stores worked fine, but by comparison, lack any real character. And yet we shared our time in the bush away from hassles of town.     I thanked Jack and his wife Nellie for rescuing a weary traveller and for their country charm as I turned to the bicycle resting on the rustic fence surrounding the homestead. And as I rode down the dusty drive back to the road I heard Nellie cry 'Call again, when passing this way!'. Later I recounted, how running on empty can sometimes lead you to find unusual refueling stops. And come away with more than refreshment, but hope for the soul. YOUR WORLD IS A TRULY AMAZING PLACE. ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS STOP LONG ENOUGH TO NOTICE IT! AND IN DOING SO, MAY RESTORE THE SOUL.   
As the tides are govern by the moon. It is not so surprising that we too may be affected by the lunar forces. As the moon becomes full, the stranger the loss of reality some people have. Then add heat, and pretty soon severe mental derangement afflicts cyclists to believe that cycling after dark would be cooler.  The bitumen melting should have been a warning sign, and the lingering heat of late afternoon should have been a forewarning that the haze in the distance had blinded our sense of reality. But touring cyclist have a obsession with cycling and it's related pleasures. Even though the days had been hot, really hot, the need to get out into the bush camping made us choose a night ride, with near full moon to provide enough light to cycle by. Leaving just before sunset, would allow us to check the equipment is tied to the bikes, and get along the  busier section of road before dark. Within minutes of setting off from the driveway, I was questioning the shower I had before leaving to meet the friend, Ms R.U. Crazi, I was cycling with. The moon and heat must have given both my friend and I nocturnal delusions as the temperature didn't drop after dark. In fact, it was just as hot. Who's idea was this. Were we true lunatics? Most of our friends and family would have had both of us certified if allowed. Perhaps the heat had already melted our minds the days before. The ride was not to be all that long, but we forgot about the temperature slowing us down. We were in the oven on high heat, every little bit of moisture was being drawn from us. And we were drinking non-stop trying not to become dehydrated. Sweat was running off us, and our perspiration could have easily broken the drought. It was 10:30pm when the bikes were laid down at the Reedy Creek campsite. Next was to set up the tents and have a cup of coffee before hitting the sack. Not long after climbing into my tent, I wondered if someone would find me in the coming days cooked in a pressure cooker inside the tent. But a sight breeze kept me from becoming a well done roast. The next morning was very different from the night before. But knowing it would quickly heat up once the sun was up. Ms R.U Crazi and I broke camp early to ride back to town, only to face an uphill climb for 6 kilometres. As we know most up hills are followed by downhills and this one did not disappoint with the reward of cool air rushing past on our descent. The ride to town was only stopped when having just ridden past the town sign and stopping for a drink of water, the rear tyre went flat when ready to push on. A quick change of tube saw us on our way and looking forward to a cold drink and cool shower. 
  The drought's Broken! Or is it just Sweat? Here I am sitting beside the track, and unable to even find a shadow to cool my head. The  bull-dust covering me is as thick as a wedding cake's icing, only not as nice. It' has been nearly a year since the idea first came to me to cycle along desert tracks to small outback communities, encouraged by early outback missionaries who travelled the roads less travelled to care for those in isolated places.  To most Australians anything vaguely rural is 'the bush'. At some indeterminate point 'the bush becomes 'the OUTBACK'. The Outback, for many is beyond the furthest fence, and government outpost. It's the never-never, where flies fly backwards to keep the sand out of their eyes. My journey began as I rode my heavy laden bicycle to the railway station at close to midnight, to await the arrival of the 'Indian Pacific'. The Indian Pacific was a silvery sleek, shiny as a new nickel, humming with the sense of impending adventure. It was the prefect machine to propel me into the outback for the start of my adventure.  I arrived at Broken Hill just after sunrise at eight in the morning and stepped blinking from the train with the bike from the luggage car. It was cooler today than the record of forty-eight degrees C, that's hot, too darn hot.          After breakfast I headed down to the local police station to let them know of my plan to ride to White Cliffs via the road to Mutawintji National Park. They could see that this crazy man had done his home work, knowing that people die in the desert, I told them that if I wasn't in Wilcannia in five days time, that they better come looking for me. 'In a few hours you will be in the real outback where people who don't take precautions do die, even those who do have come to grief' said the young officer behind the counter. And with that they wished me well. He was right. In the few kilometres from the town limits the black-top gave way to a hard earthen road full of potholes, ruts and cement hard corrugations, as jarring as riding over railway sleepers.     Through a landscape empty and brilliantly warm in winter. Past low saltbush and spiky spinifex, the odd turpentine bush and weary looking eucalypt. Here and there along the roadside were the corpses of kangaroos and the occasional basking goanna. Goodness knows how many living things survive in the heat out here in summer. There are creekbeds out there that haven't seen water in fifteen years. The supreme emptiness of this land, the galling uselessness of such a mass of land, was something that took the country's European settlers a long time to adjust to. Several of the earliest explorers were so convicted they would encounter mighty river systems, or an inland sea that they took boats with them. Reading accounts of early forays, it is clear that the first explorers were often ludicrously out of their depths. In expedition after expedition the leaders seemed willfully, almost comically, unable to provision themselves sensibly. It was into this tradition of haplessness that Burke and Wills improvidently stepped in 1860. They are far and away the most famous of Australian explorers, which is perhaps a little curious since their   expedition accomplished almost nothing, cost a fortune and ended in tragedy.    Even today, the emptiness of so much of Australia is  startling. The landscape I was now cycling through was officially only 'semi-desert', but it was barren an expanse as I had ever seen. Every now or then, there be a lonely mailbox and a track leading to an unseen sheep or cattle station.     Once today a convoy of modern day explorers pasted in a four-wheel drive in a hell-for-leather fashion, spraying me in gravelly bits and a coating of fine red bull-dust. Pretty soon after leaving the National Park three days out of Broken Hill, I soon found the outback, the track by now had become sand, and now was nearly two foot deep. Dragging a bicycle in these conditions is harder enough, but add a trailer with the supplies to survive in this wilderness, and I was a broken man. By now I had drunk nearly half of my 12 litres of water. In fact the sweat running down my face into my eyes, could have easily broken the drought. With the stories of failed explorers still ringing in my ear I turned back to the safety of the National Park where there was drinking water and communications with the outside world. Unlike the early explorers, I was lucky to be rescued from the hardship with a ride back to the Hill by a couple who must have felt sorry for a dust encrusted rider, and weary looking. Travelling over the road that took me two and a half days to cover had me back in Broken Hill. Where I looked forward to a running shower to wash the sun baked crust from my body. After a restful night I awoke early to the news of a tailwind to the east. So after down a mix-grill fit for the hardiest of explorers I headed east towards Wilcannia before heading north to While Cliffs once again.     Seeing it today, it is hard to think that Wilcannia was once a mighty river port, loading bales of wool onto paddle steamers bound for Adelaide.     Now a near ghost town the river is almost dry due to the drought and the irrigation upstream. Once the town boomed with the sound of steam whistles, today the local Aboriginals are all that remain. A 109km north of the river town of Wilcannia, is the mining town of White Cliffs. Upon seeing it, it all but impossible to believe that White Cliffs, a small blotch of habitation under a hard clear sky, was once a boom town, with a populations of nearly 4,500, a hospital, a   newspaper, a library, and a busy core of general stores, hotels, restaurants, brothels and gaming houses. Today White Cliffs consists of a pub, a launderette, an opal shop, and a grocery/caf/petrol station. The permanent population is about eighty. They exist in a relentless world of heat and dust. And if you were looking for people with the tolerance and fortitude to colonize Mars this would be the place to look.    Because of the heat, most people living underground in the side of the two bleached hills from which the town takes it's name. The rooms are very nice and quite   normal except for the walls and ceilings were cave-like and windowless as I was to find out as my host Bruce showed me to my room in his house.    I don't know how much you would have to give me to persuade me to settle in White Cliffs-- something like a few million. Later I was about to asked Bruce and his wife Helen what possesses them to stay in this godforsaken outpost where even a run to the supermarket means a six-hour round trip over a rutted dirt road, but before I could speak a remarkable thing happened Kangaroos hopped into the foreground and began grazing as the sun lowered in the western skies. The sky was glowing pinks, deep purples, careless banners of crimson-- all on a scale that you could not imagine, for there was no high-rise to block the view between us and the far horizon.   I asked him what brought him to White Cliffs. 'I worked on the Flying Doc's radio's, and did a bit of mining and just never really left', he said. 'It was a lot more remote back then. Took us eight or more hours from Broken Hill, the roads were that bad, especially the way you tried to come by the National Park. Now you can do it in three hours from Broken Hill on the all weather road, but back then the roads were rough as guts every inch of the way', he said. 'Yeah it was a different world' Bruce went on to say musingly. Still is, I thought, a throw back to   another time when men were men and a spirit of discovery was a way of life. 
I'm by no means an expert at this quite yet, just do it for pleasure, and as a long term goal, to get my legs in better shape to be able to do some long distance touring!  A word about my bike, as I might have mentioned in the author page; it IS a piece of poop! It's a (drumroll please!) Huffy "Howler" (lol, YES, howler) and if you need to find out why I bought such a crappy bike, read the author page lol... so its not the best, but I'll tell you what, it got me deep into my love of bycicles and of course I have my eyes set on a nicer one now, but it has helped me a lot so far. So anywho, onto the ride... As I said before, I start north/west bound towards downtown Denver on the Cherry Creek Bike path from around Holly... (details in case someone from Denver is reading, or someone interested in riding by here... BTW if someone needs a place to crash, or camp, or shwer what not, PLEASE let me know!)...   After about 8 miles (and 25 minutes or so from my house) I pass lower downtown Denver, and right by my school to Confluence park, which is where the Platte and Cherry Creek rivers join, and as I love to mention, the downtown Denver REI building is, where I spend countless hours roaming around oohing and aahing like a zombie... best toy store, I swear (well maybe next to Guitar Center or what not hehe)      Further southbound from Confluence Park, I go down the South Platte River bike trail, through some nice scenery, and by a golf course...      After the golf course is just more pretty scenery of south of downtown Denver, amidst beautiful trees and riverside fields...    This picture is of the fork in the road where I can either go left onto the C-470 trail east/southbound or west/southbound onto the Bear Creek Trail, which I think rocks, I forgot to take more pictures of further down the road, but I'll have to post some later on... For now, I have a couple pix of that area, heh...   
  #1 on the map:.New Haymarket Memorial at Desplaines and Randolph. Previously only a small bronze placket Designated by Richard M. Daley, in 1992 on the sidewalk demarked the site of the speakers' wagon and the historic significance of the site, which read: "A decade of strife between labor and industry culminated here in a confrontation that resulted in the tragic death of both workers and policemen. On May 4, 1886, spectators at a labor rally had gathered around the mouth of' Crane's Alley. A contingent of police approaching on Des Plaines Street were met by a bomb thrown from just south of the alley it landed on the west side of Desplaines, most likely thrown from the vestibule of a building on the Northeast corner of Randolph and Desplaines. The resultant trial of eight activists gained worldwide attention for the labor movement, and initiated the tradition of "May Day" labor rallies. In 2004 the city installed the current monument by sculptor Mary Brogger, of a fifteen-foot speakers' wagon echoing the wagon on which the labor leaders stood on to address the crowds.        Just to the north of the monument, on Lake Street was Zepfs Hall home to the Lumbershovers' Union that had asked Albert Spies to speak to its members at the McConnick Reaper Plant on May 3, 1886. When the bomb exploded in the crowd, Albert and Lucy Parsons were in the first floor tavern of Zepfs Hall with their children and their friend Lizzie Holmes.                We rode south on Desplaines, right past the former location of the police station in 1886,  the site of the 3rd District Police station 19 South -120 North Des Plaines Street. The location of the station from which the police were sent in to Haymarket Square to disperse the labor rally on the evening of May 4, 1886. The detail of police who marched in the front line that night were killed when the infamous Haymarket bomb, hurled from a nearby vestibule, exploded within their midst. The repercussions of the Haymarket incident galvanized the labor movement worldwide resulting in the gradual acceptance of the eight-hour workday.  The identity of the bomb thrower has never been determined.   Then west on Madison, past some of the more colorful parts in Chicago's history, referred to as 'Stripper's Row.'  In the I950s, this area of Madison Street was home to numerous adult clubs and known as Stripper's Row. Some of the club names and locations were: Haymarket Halsted and Madison; Academy Halsted and Madison; Star & Garter 915 Madison; Music Box 932 Madison; So Ho 1124 Madison; Flamingo 1359 Madison; E1 Mocambo 1519 Madison. Then south, through the very nice campus of the University of Illinois at Chicago.  The construction of the university itself caused some consternation because it displaced much of the Maxwell Street Market, a famous flee market on the near south side.  You can ride outside the campus and still smell, and buy, the Maxwell Street Polish Sausage sandwiches.  A minor calamity going south on Halstead!  I got lost, which isn't that unusual.  We ran into a bunch of traffic - both cars and cyclists.  The group got commingled with the other cyclists and a couple of blocks later I realized I didn't recognize anybody.  So I quickly checked the map, realized my error.  I went back to 16th street but didn't see anybody so from that point on I just followed the map. Which created a dilemma: was I ahead of the group, or behind?  Do I speed ahead, or wait?  It would be unusual for me to be ahead of anybody, so I sauntered down the street hoping all would catch up.  After a while, they didn't.  So I sped ahead. Actually, the map the Rick Bak, the organizer, has prepared was pretty good, and the route was well chosen.  There were few turns so it was easy to follow.  At once point, near Ogden, Oakley, and Roosevelt Road I stopped and waited and had a good view of points east - to see if I could see a large group.  We had one rat-bike high rider so I thought that might be easy to spot.  After a while, I decided to press on and probably catch up at the cemetery or else wait there. Someplace along Roosevelt (which has a nice bike lane most of the way) I stopped behind a fence for a little relief, and saw the pack coming up behind me!  So I climbed out from behind the fence and joined up with them again.  By this time the group had shrunk to about 15 or so.  Some of the vehicles were really meant for the 20-mile trip through the city to the cemetery out in Forest Park.                    Just recently, a Chicago Park was named after her, the first park in Chicago named after a woman. Lucy Ella Gonzales Parsons (1853  1942) Park, 4712 W. Belmont Ave., is named after the labor reformer and womens rights activist who organized the Working Womens Union No. 1 in 1878, the only women workers union in Chicago at the time.  The last time I did this ride, a couple of years ago, there were several members of the IWW, the Industrial Workers of the World, or 'wobblies' at the monument.  This year we may have gone on the wrong Sunday - nobody from that group was there, unfortunately.  But we still had Al Schorsch with us and his banjo and songs.    I wimped out and took the Blue Line rapid transit from the end of the line, which is only a couple of blocks north of the cemetery.  This I rode to Jefferson Park, I wanted to stop at a surplus store I knew of to pick of some shim material I needed to mount the handlebar bags on my bike. A good day, warm.  I got sunburned!  About a 25 mile ride.  Something to look forward to next year. A lot of the history in here was scanned, cut, and pasted from material provided for the ride by Brian Dartmund who acted as our narrator and explainer along the route.    A short history of the Haymarket Ride In 2002 Chicago area artists Brian Dortmund, and Michael Piazza collaborated and initiated the ride as a part of Michael Piazza's project "The Eight Hour Action Series."  Michael designed The Eight Hour Action Series to be an open movement allowing collaborations; this is something he did with so much of his work. Brian Dortmund's objective in the creation of the Ride was to find a way to connect different groups I.e.,   Cyclists, History Buffs, Labor Activists, and Anarchists (who never follow the map we create, but end up meeting us at Forest Home Cemetery) in this communal event.  Brian approached Michael with the Haymarket Ride project, and he worked with him teaching a great deal about the history of the movement, his heroes, the martyrs, and the sites. Every year new parts of the rich history are revealed and we owe this all to Michael's efforts. Rick Bak has worked with Michael and Brian since 2004 and as a group they would ride the routes, plan the maps, and discuss new parts of the historical framework we would uncover. The historical text used on this journal is from the handouts Brian wrote and compile to hand out at the ride. Like the ride, the information grows each year and we learn more and do our best to circulate it so people can find these places and remember the events. 
After showing my CGOAB C&O Canal bike tour pictures (at Canal2006) to some people, they got more interested in the Canal and eventually arranged a boat tour which I went along with and took some movie clips (40 sec maximum silent limitation of the camera, not to mention the artistic limitations of the camera user...), audio clips of some tour speeches and music (Urman's On the Canal on http://video.google.com, http://YouTube.com, local PBS, DVD, http://www.onthecanal.4t.com , etc is much better, and while I have no financial interest, was pleased to hear about it first resupplying and pleasant company at Bill's Place in Orleans, MD, email Urman and tell other bikers about it as well as http://BikeWashington.org/canal guides), better than a few stills... So going up river at the race speeds of 3 miles / hour ;-} by two (other) mules with my new folding bike accommodated (as a personal mobility aid? before a luggage bag resupplies from the folding vendor) in the mule locker (mine didn't make a mess ;-} but how many other places will allow that?  Chesapeake Bridge? MetroRail at Rush hour?), here is another way for those that want to see what the Canal was originally designed for, cargo, i.e. tons of coal, grain, etc with house boat living accommodations that would be the envy of any bike loaded tourer (or large office cubicle occupant for that matter), though this boat has sheltering canopy out of the sun, hay for the mules would be kept in one segment (white chest in middle of boat separated but cut out in replica vessel) and the bottom having coal/ feed/ whatever, mostly non human cargo...  Water would have been an issue, even on the river as pollution described even back 100+ years ago... http://COCanalBoatTour.pbwiki.com may have more of a collaborative story in the future as little people grow older and say some neat things about biking it instead of just watching pictures on computer of it...     Musical entertainment by this fiddle playing narrator, who was going to bike down the Canal a few days later and another volunteer performer on banjo, plus recruited washboard players from the audience (wonder if taking a washboard on bike would make any sense? or design something dual purpose?) and staff kindly allowed the bike to be stowed in the mule locker up front (behind her in the white bow section in picture), but I doubt they will make a habit of it...  In modern times the Brunswick MARC commuter trains with a folding bike may be a way to start going further to the Great Allegheney Passage up past Pittsburg, PA and skip the earlier familiar and already traveled sections, doing more trails like an Appalachian Trail hiker in segments... But as recently discovered the relatively new Trader Joe's blocks away in Georgetown would not likely be a place to stock up on supplies, unless staff there has gotten a better attitude towards descrimiating against at least one biker with gear...   Type:       MPEG ADTS, layer III, v2,  64 kBits, 24 kHz, Monaural    Size:       620 KB      A brief music clip (this or another one?) of a red haired boy, of Irish background, perhaps not that different than myself in years past... But this graying and balding overgrown boy found a bicycle (heavy steel? clunker lost at college when left on rack during a leave of absence, later Peugot, maybe converting a similar one after the original broke a frame, as a replication to a Fixie?, having lost my first thrift store mountain bike at a library, thinking it would be OK unlocked for just a moment WRONG!) to wander away from home, get out of the house, away from 'broken' family, school, latch key life, and other concerns, to do the Rock Creek Park on weekends (sections closed to cars), but never really heard about biking the Canal in the 70s or considered touring until later old and disabled in spirit. So maybe someone will find this little message in a bottle, and discover the joys of biking the Canal, or expand their existing DC trip just up from Watergate (end of Canal and mile 0 by Thompson boat center and the Waterfront, which was missed even by this native (make it past one presidential term, bye George, and some Washingtonians will consider you a native ;-} ), and the political plumbing problems, next to the Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts which hosts high school graduations among other things...   See the resources contributed elsewhere on CGOAB among other places and consider our modern selves a little lucky to have a  national park (a Supreme Court Justice challenged media of Washington Post editors to walk the Canal with him to create the park instead of paving it over for cars like on the GW Parkway across the river after railroads took over before cars) at a time now when Virginia is expanding transportation like  MetroRail to Dulles Airport, the nation is fighting wars over oil, and people are largely obese, including kids,  red haired and not... Oh yeah, wash your mouth out with soap for being so unpatriotic ;-} Another short boat tour is available on the Canal upstream?
 We started off bright and early from my house (Aaron) around 7:45. We immediately realized we had our work cut out for us. We were heading SW towards Eureka, and there was a strong wind heading NE. The first place of interest was the Woodford County Line a.k.a. 2000 N 3200 E. It was quite a sight for sore eyes. I felt as if I were like Lewis and Alex was like Clark and we had come upon the mighty Pacific Ocean. We came to know Woodford County as "The Land of Beautiful Wildflowers and Shoulderless Roads"    Crossing over I-39 we ran into our uncle Bob. It was good to see a familiar face. We shared stories from our trip and took some picture. We would be reunited with Bob later.    Ten miles later we reached the booming metropolis of Benson, IL, proud winners of the 1995 IHSA Class A Baseball Tournament in conjunction with Roanoke.    A short time later we found ourselves in Roanoke, that's when things started getting interesting.     Outside of Roanoke we stopped at my friend Steven's house. We had a small breakfast at his house. From Steven's it was only about 10 miles to Eureka.   Right before we reached Eureka, Joe, Alex's dad found us and gave us just the encouragement we needed to finish our epic trek.   Once we reached Eureka we went to the major tourist hot spot, the courthouse where we found a cool looking tank.   About 2 min later we were at Grandpa and Grandma's house.   It's hard to believe that such an epic journey could be completed in one morning. Alex and I both readily agree that tandeming in Central Illinois is a life-changing experience and recommend it to anyone who's bottom is up for the challenge.
I ride a 2005 Specialized Rockhopper Comp, with a Burley D'lite in tow. The Burley is great for carting my daughter around town, but when it comes to touring I think that its simply to big. There is way to much room in the Burley and I found myself trying to fill it up. I am thinking that a BOB trailer is the way to go. The reason that I say this, is the BOB will limit the amount of space and it is not as wide. With the Burley on narrow shoulders I was really fighting the rumble strips on the road.  The ride there took right at 3 hours of ride time with an average of 13.7 mph. In the middle of the day, I think that I hit the hottest part of the day. By the time that I got to the camp ground, I was over heated and it took the rest of the afternoon to cool down.    The camp ground was nice. Really clean restrooms, with running water. The one thing that I have to say is that the RV's with "Rent Me" on the back scare me. The RV that I speak of shows up at the camp ground about 8:30 p.m. and they drive around the camp ground 3 times before they find a spot. One thing that I need to tell you is that the camp ground only has 3 spots of RV hook-ups, and they are marked. Also let me add that when the RV showed up, there was only me and the ground keeper there. I think that 3 kids poured out of the RV screaming and then there is about an hour of the adults trying to figure out how to hook the RV up.   I learned my lesson from the day before, so on the return trip I got up and let much earlier. It took 2hours 37 minutes of ride time to get home covering the same distance.   What I learned:  1.) Take a pillow next time.  2.) Stores that were open 3 years ago may not be open this time for a cool resting place.  3.) An awful lot of birds get hit by cars. I counted 15 dead birds.  4.) Childrens hangers are everywhere, I counted 8 in a 17 mile stretch.             
The mindset and experience of self-sufficient, self-contained, unsupported or whatever terminology you prefer for this type of touring deserves to bask in its own limelight.  So, I was surprised when told by Adventure Cycling staff upon my founding the UBTS (a society/club based solely on this type of touring) that they knew of no other such club in the country.  Amazing; no other organization in the US or North America (as far as they know) that's been formed to bring self-sufficient tourers together.  This is was an idea I had years ago and after getting the ball rolling, I immediately realized that it's time had surely come. In short notice, the Utah Bicycle Touring Society has become a fantastic social experience for about 25 people who use their bikes in this fashion, and we've just gotten started.   We do little more than get together every other month during Utah's riding season.  We open and close the season with a casual dinner where we can talk about touring plans for the year, watch trip slide shows and so on.  The other three times we come together are unique touring outings.  A weekend and campsite is picked and tourers ride in from wherever they wish, bringing their tent, food, stove and whatever else they choose want for the weekend.  Hey, if you're a self-sufficient tourer, this has to sound a lot better than car camping.  If you're new to touring, what better way to get your feet wet?   Come on people, where's the ABTS, CBTS, DBTS, FBTS and so on?  We have no club dues, no president, no meetings and no real month to month operating costs.  Start a blog and let the news spread by word of mouth and whatever other means available.  Move the ride to locations around your state if need be and sit back and watch as the tourers materialize from all corners of your community.  Self-contained tours within your state among these new riding friends will automatically come to fruition.  How could you not want this?  As it says on the UBTS homepage, "Wouldn't it be great to have a social network of every self-sufficient tourer in your state?  Why yes, yes it would."   So, this tour journal is of our tour to the year's second UBTS Rendezvous at Rock Cliff Nature Preserve.  There are many nice routes leading to this wonderful campground.  We had to drive close enough for a relatively short ride so we could get back the next day in time to pick our boarded Border Collie up at the kennel.  We would have left him there for an extra day but we just got back from Alaska and figure he's been away from home enough.  A short tour into the gathering but at least we're able to go. Our chosen route this time was from Wanship Utah.  It's a small dot on the map (if there at all) that's right off of I-84.  It's a beautiful place in a southwestern kinda way.  There's a cafe at the interstate offramp and a trail head for the rail trail that runs from Coalville to Park City.  We'll be taking the rail trail to SR 248 to Kamas then SR 32 on to Rock Cliff.    Here we've made it to our starting point. Some front racks are a real pain when it comes to loading the bike on a car's roof rack.  The Tubus Tara isn't that bad as it can be disconnected from the lower mounting point, swung up and secured with velcro (or something) and left on the bike.  Above is a shot of such an arrangement.  That's velcro around the brake bosses holding the rack up for transport. After about 15-20 minutes in the parking lot, we were on our way.  The rail trail isn't paved but we were both on very wide tires.  I've ridden this trail in the past using my cyclocross bike and 700x32c Schwalbe Marathon XRs.  It was fun but my personal preference would be for at least 35c tires for the surface.  Rail trail grades are usually very shallow and this is one is no exception but we were climbing.  It was also into the wind for us.  Along this stretch of I-84 you normally have either a headwind or tailwind because it's between the mountains.  Otherwise, what a beautiful day.  Blue skies and not too hot.  This year, Utah saw it's hottest month ever on record.  We were lucky not to be riding in 100+ degrees.    There are a few cattle ranches along the trail and the Weber River runs here too.  We'd be passing through an number of stock gates.  Today marked the second day we've had on the trail where we had to negotiate with cows.  The first time was a few months ago before our tour of Alaska and we weren't successful then.  They wouldn't move and there was no way to get around them.  This time, after about 5 minutes of acting up they mooooved on.      SR 248 has a nice shoulder but had some glass and debris in it.  Not a problem for proper touring tires.  It's a pretty ride but there's a lot of new development going on here.  That said, this is a popular cycling route and we saw over a dozen roadies getting their rides in.  It's not flat in this part of the state so the hills are gonna have to come sometime. : ) Though it wasn't 100+ degrees, we were still feeling the heat.  We couldn't show up at Rock Cliff early because the campground was closed for the annual Jordanelle Triathlon. Rock Cliff was going to be closed for the night but the Park Managers were nice enough to allow the UBTS entry after 3:30PM.  This had been coordinated far in advance. SR 248 intersects SR32/SR35 in Kamas and at this intersection is a convenient store.  We stopped in here for a cold V8 drink to replace some of what we'd burned along the warm roadside.  A right turn here and we were on a two mile stretch before making the final turn that would take us to the park entrance.  This two mile bit of this route has no shoulder and can be somewhat busy on the weekend with recreationalists.  Our "Take-a-Look" mirrors make riding on shoulder less roads much easier to deal with though and it was only two miles.      So two miles down the road from the Kamas intersection, SR 35 continues forward but SR 32 takes a 90 degree turn and we turned right.  Just a few tenths of a mile and we'd be there at the entrance to Rock Cliff Nature Preserve.   We made it to the fee station pretty close to 3:30PM and were told that no one else had ridden in yet.  With that, we rode on to the Nature Center where we'd find the Park Ranger I'd made our arrangements through.  After talking to her for a little while, we paid for our campsite and walked down to the campground. Our choice of 52 tent sites.  Aside from bathrooms/showers and a pavilion, 52 tent sites is all that's here.  No RV sites, no car camping sites... just tents.  This is a rarity in Utah unless you're talking about small primitive campgrounds.  Only 28.49 miles - 11.48 Ave Speed - 38.7 mph Max    Ahh, such a nice relaxing place, just off the beaten path.    I started setting the tent up while Nancy went off for her shower.  I wasn't that far along before tourers started coming in.      Word spreads relatively slowly among the touring populous so it stands to reason that every time we have our gatherings, they'll be long time tourers that have just joined in on the fun.  Rob here has toured from Utah to Arctic Circle AK and back as well as some other big ones.  He covered the 60-70 miles from his home in Sandy Utah to the campground and was lucky enough to have a tailwind for most of it.  Luck dawg! More and more came in, all having great rides and for a couple of folks it was their first self-sufficient tour.    6ish PM and we all started gathering at the pavilion to whip up our dinners.  Aside from the riding, this is what it's all about.  Stories and other fun around the campsite.    After dinner folks were having a great time catching up or covering the ground you normally do after meeting new friends.  At 9PM I broke in to give everyone a chance to hear about our Denali adventure and answer questions about it.  Afterwards, I worked up the nerve to sing two little songs I'd written and performed at the last campsite on the Denali Highway.  This night however, my voice and memory needed some warming up.  I botched the first number badly and I was lucky no one brought any rotten tomatoes along.  The second song was much better but my voice was still off.  Ahhh well, it's free lighthearted entertainment and laughs were the goal in the first place.  More on the songs in our Alaska journal when I get around to it. After I finished, Peter and Lorraine told us all about their recent 17 days on the Lewis & Clark.  Followed by Lou and Julie talking about their 1,200 mile tour around Wisconsin that's kicking off in September.   Before we started off for our campsites I let everyone know that come the end of October, we'll be closing the year out with a UBTS dinner where I'll plan to show a 25 minute DVD slide show of our Alaska tour.  Yikes!  I'd better get to making that thing then. : ) On our way back to the campsites Lou mentioned that on the last gathering here they'd discovered a raccoon paw print on one of their panniers in the morning.  I'd never seen such an animal here in the past and we'd never had food issues at Rock Cliff.  However, as Nancy was putting the food away in the BOB Trailer bag I asked her if she wanted to do something else with it since we'd heard about raccoons.  Nahhh, I'm putting it all in this bag and it's ziplocked....... 0150 I'm brought out my sleep by rattle, clank, swish, click & clack and such.  Out of the tent to find this...    Hmmmm.  That's not how we left that.  In the darkness we gathered up our remaining food bits and hauled them off to the shower facilities where they'd be safe for the night and hopefully leave our campsite quiet.  This worked real well except for a little noise the visitors made at 4AM to find the cupboards empty.  Lesson learned.  Better to spend 10 minutes, 10 minutes past your bedtime than 10 minutes in the middle of your sleep cycle.  : )    Last night I was saddened to learn that the villains had made off with most of our breakfast.  Come morning I was pleasantly surprised to see that they hadn't carried it very far.  We were able to reclaim a couple of rations that hadn't been compromised.  Picky little varmints.     Morning gatherings confirmed that Lou and Julie also had uninvited guests in the middle of the night.  They fixed the problem by bringing the food into their vestibule.  Folks, don't do that in bear country please.  Having been in Grizzly country and repeatedly schooled on food storage rights and wrongs, I doubt I'll ever have food inside our tent.  For the raccoons pleasure I'll be hanging our food at Rock Cliff or more likely using our bear vault just for the sake of getting more mileage out of that $70 spent.    Show links to this Hide links to this      It's been a while since I've had this bike on any long tours.  I'd spun it up for use in AK but at that last minute took my Rocky Mountain Sherpa.  The Thorn Nomad was born to handle nasty roads like the Denali Highway and I'd gone the further step of having the legendary Peter White build it a pair of insanely strong wheels utilizing Velocity Cliffhanger rims.  They wait to be put to a real test.     Kathy opened up the Nature Center at 9 so we waited there and said goodbye for the year though we'll continue talking over the land line.     The weather was wonderful once again.  On the road at 10AM.  Right out of the gate that 10% hits you (shown above) but it's short.  We stopped for an OJ at the convenient store before hooking a left onto SR 248.  Before we were rolling again a six pack of roadies spun into the parking lot looking for morning snacks.  We chatted with them and answered a volley of questions about the defective reasoning behind our choice to *load* a bicycle rather than drilling holes in it for weight saving purposes.  They apparently had one friend afflicted with a plight similar to ours and thus I passed UBTS data on. Talk to the roadies.  Talk to the RVers.  Talk to the motorcyclists.  Talk to the townspeople.  Talk to them all.  For every 10 times you spend 10 minutes with someone answering the "Where are you going on that thing?" type questions, there's gotta be one that starts thinking...  "Hmmm, bicycle touring." 29.16 miles - 12.40 Ave Speed - 38.2 mph Max Tailwinds!
   After making it to the base, the main gate was a sight for sore eyes as many drivers here do not acknowledge a cyclist as a human, but as a hood ornament.    Riding a recumbent here is like wearing an elephant on your head, everyone sees you coming and the first question is "are you handicapped?"          Well, I knew it couldn't be all easy, the wind picked up and it became a bit more laborious in getting across the base. But I was bound and determined to finish this trip. Enjoy the pics!      In closing I would like to point out a few little lessons learned. I will very soon go shopping for cycling shoes, My running shoes are going to be the death of me. Personally speaking, I enjoy riding and challenge anyone to actually enjoy it and not to think of it as a chore. Fitness is good but fun fitness is even better. Take time to stop and enjoy the world around you. Join me for some fun in Southern Maryland sometime!   
 Tom and I took the tandem out for a little trek across Central Indiana. Luckily for us Borders carries a detailed map of Central Indiana. Big ups to Borders. The "ride" actually started the night before as we carbed up at the Nelson's.    We got up around 6 because we had a little bit of a drive before we started. We left from Crawfordsville around 9:30 from a Pilot Gas Station.    After about one mile we came across a llama farm.        Next, we saw some buffalo. They were a little more friendly.      Then we got a flat.    After the flat we started really moving and it wasn't long before we reached Westfield, IN    Then we went to the Keynote vision dinner....The End           
After some rides around Cannes, Juan-les-Pins and Antibes, today I'm starting from N98 road, just east of downtown Nice.    Turning on Mont Boron road, this is a gentle ascent to the top of the hill where, after turning around the Plateau du Mont Boron, I make a stop at the belvedere, enjoying the view towards the Baie des Anges. Going downhill by Chemin de la Borne which offers a view on Villefranche-sur-Mer and Saint-Jean-Cap-Ferrat peninsula, I reach N98 again.      After cycling through Villefranche's Marina and old streets, I take the beach road, Promenade des Marinires. The crossing of the peninsula is done while cycling on streets shaded by the pines, almost deserted. Everywhere there are  opulent estates, actually one can't see the houses hidden by high fences. This place is among the richest of the Cte-D'Azur. At the southern tip, there is an access to the pedestrian trail that circles the peninsula. I walk a while on it with the bike, but there are more and more stone steps, so I come back. It would be a nice hike : sharp rocks along the coast, blue sky and deep blue sea ! I keep it for another time.    Cycling through the village of Saint-Jean-Cap-Ferrat, I stop at the marina to take some pictures. I love this coast !        Leaving the village by the seaside promenade, I come back on N98 road (called the Basse Corniche) in Beaulieu-sur-Mer. I'm crossing Eze and, farther, having no light on the bike, instead of going through the highway's tunnel, I take the ancient road on the cliff. Greater view too ! Soon I am arriving in Cap-d'Ail and stop at the bakery to buy some pastries and bread. Now that the sun is lower, it's time to get back at full speed to Nice.  This last day of 2006 has been such a beautiful day ! 
   The trail has a very gentle feel about it with hardly any hills which makes it the perfect day out for people who are not massively bike fit, Heidi had only ever ridden 50km in a day thus far and she was already starting to really enjoy herself with the easy pace and great scenery.    Passing through old railway station's was a nice touch, many of them had been converted into nice picnic areas and were very well maintained which is nice to see.We also spotted alot of live stock and wildlife, namely cows, sheep, lama's even a few emu's plus I also spotted a small snake and a few rabbits, really great stuff plus riding next to wineries is also a great feeling      The K's slowly started to roll on and before we knew it we were almost at warburton, about 10km out Heidi was suffering from a slowly deflating tire, so rather than fix it just now we decided to pump and ride, then when it was almost flat pump again, this got us into Warburton were we proceeded to grab a bite to eat, it was pie and chips for Heidi and a chicken sandwhich with chips for me.    After fixing the flat and having a sit by the river which was very pleasant it was time to head off home, another 45km of really nice riding lay in front of us and I couldn't wait, Heidi was starting to complain about a sore neck so we took it easy and really enjoyed the ride my website is www.cyclingaddict.com enjoy     
The thought for this trip began in the summer of 2000. My plan was to do a cross country bike trip starting in Yorktown, VA and ending in Astoria, OR.  This trip was an Adventure Cycling Cross Country Tour.  There were 13 members on that tour.  The trip started in Yorktown, VA which is the starting point on the east coast for the Tran-American Bike Trail.  Over the next 18 days we biked any where from 32 miles per day to 80 miles per day.  The Trans-American route takes you through the heart of VA. While the biking was a lot of fun, the accommodations in route for sleeping and eating left a lot to be desired.  There were times when we went 3 days before showering.  Out of the 18 days I was on the tour, we knew where we were going to sleep before we got there about 1/2 the time.  In at least one case, we even arrived at where we were supposed to stay and found that we had moved to another location, just what you want to hear when you've already ridden 75 miles that day. 18 days later we arrived in Berea, KY on the western edge of the Appalachian Mountains.  In Berea I made the decision to terminate my participation in the tour. Let me say at this point, Adventure Cycling is a great organization that all bicyclists should belong to.  They do good work for the cycling world.  Every tour has a leader with there own style.  I just got a bad tour.  I would like to make it clear at this point that the people in this tour were not the reason I terminated.  We had 7 people from Holland and the rest were from all over America and they were great people.  I have stayed in touch with most of them including the Europeans.  I would ride with any of them anywhere again but not with Adventure Cycling. Shortly after returning home in June of 2000 my brother-in-law called me and asked if I would be interested in continuing the Tran-American tour in the summer of 2001 but organizing it ourselves.  I told him I would think about it but we needed at least 3 or 4 people. We both agreed to think about it for a few months and communicate by email. We thought about it for about one week and both decided we would love to do it.  We agreed to use a sag wagon which would take a lot of the weight off the bikes and be much easier going up the mountains.  Around the end of the year (2000), I found out that my Nephew in Portland, Or. would go with us.  Now we had three but it would be better if we had 4.  With 4 people we could ride for 3 days and drive the sag wagon for 1 day in rotation.  Doing it this way means we would not have to take any rest days. In an effort to get one more rider, I put an add on Adventure Cycling Web Site which is available free of charge for members. Over the next three months I had about 30 inquires. In March I got a call from Jerry from Ill. who was very interested and made a commitment right away, now we had 4. With all 4  riders in place, the planning of the actual trip could start.  Travel logistics would be a problem.  Walt lives in Georgia and I live in Connecticut and Jerry lives in Ill.  The three of us have to get to Portland, OR. where Jeff lives.  The plan is I will pick up Walt then go northwest to Ill. and pick up Jerry.  We will then head for Portland to pick up Jeff and on to Astoria.  In order to start the biking on June 1st, I will have to leave Connecticut on May 25th. The current date is March 22, 2001.  We have about 2 months to get ready for the trip.  All of us are trying to get into biking shape over the next 7 weeks.  Weather has been a problem and is not looking real good.  In order to stay in shape, I will have to run (not my favorite activity) every other day until the weather improves. The Current date is May 16th, one week until the great adventure begins.  As you might expect, there have been a few changes.  Walt from Georgia has now decided to drive himself across country and deliver a no longer needed Geo Tracker to his daughter in Eugene, OR.  Robert from Connecticut does not now have to go to Atlanta to pick up Walt (I'm disappointed).  I am still leaving on the 25th but I will make a stop in Mooresville Ind. to see my sister before moving on to Ill. to pick up Jerry.  A pleasant change in plans for me.
The weather in Florida has been great for riding the bike.  Since January I have been riding the bike at least 3 times per week and of late 4 or 5 times.  My wife has been back in Connecticut for a month but I stayed in Florida just so I could continue training for the big ride. In addition to riding, I run (jog) several time a week.  Now I will be heading back up north to much colder weather so running will become a larger part of my training at least until the weather warms up.  I'm sure that Walt and Jerry and Jeff are also trying to get into shape in their own way.  At this point we are less than two months away from the start of the ride and much remains to be done.  At some point in this journal I will provide an equipment list for riding with a sag wagon.  I can't do that yet because this will be my first ride with a sag wagon. Also a big and important event in the preparation for the trip is a drivers license for my young nephew Jeff (age 24).  You might ask why does Jeff not already have a drivers license and the answer would be, I don't know.  At some point in this journal creation I will ask him and then both you and I will know. Over the next two months bikes will be tuned and made ready for the big ride.  More details will be provided about the types of bike being used at a later section of this journal.  Also, as soon as I figure out how, I will add pictures of the 4 riders in this adventure.  Some of the things that still have to be done are, add a 2" hitch to the sag wagon (1995 Chevrolet. Blazer), decide if I need to add a roof rack carrier to handle the gear for 4 people.  We will be using a Thule 4 bike hitch for the bikes. Next update will be from Connecticut (getting out my long johns) Well I've been home for 10 days and not one day has been good for riding the bike.  In order to not loose the conditioning gained in Florida, I'm running every other day which is not my favorite activity.  I'm sure that Walt is having better luck with the weather in Georgia, but from what I hear from Jerry in ILL., his weather is like mine (Connecticut).  Busy preparing my bike, a Cannondale T2000 and Jeff's bike a Nishiki Pueblo for the trip. Things that need to be done to a bike in preparation for a trip like this are many: A. Check all brake and shifter cables (replace if worn) B. New tires added (if needed) C. Brakes adjusted and new pads added D. Bearings front and rear re-packed with grease E. Spokes checked for tightness (wheels should be true,no wobbles) F. Rear rack added to bikes G. Clean the entire drive train and lube H. Clean the bike and check that all nuts and bolts are tight I. Add a new drive chain (if worn) J. Ride the bike and make sure the gears all go up and down smooth. I'm sure I will add to this list as we progress over the next 7 weeks. The date is April 19th and the weather in Connecticut is still not good for riding a bicycle.  We are making good progress however toward getting ready for our big adventure.   The 1995 Chevrolet Blazer is now ready for the trip, new brakes, new thermostat, new fan belt, and the replacement of an idler arm (a component in the front suspension),and four new shocks.  All of this is an effort to make sure my Chevrolet with 100,000 miles on it does not give us trouble on the trip.  Also, the hitch and receiver for carrying the bicycles are installed.  Using a Hitch and Receiver is a great way to carry bicycles because it allows entry into the rear of the vehicle without removing the bicycles. All the work on the bicycles is complete (at least for Jeff and I).  Now the job of deciding what to bring on the trip as far as tools, clothing, cooking gear, camping gear, rain gear, warm weather gear, etc,.  I'm sure all of us will be thinking about what to bring right up to the departure date.  We did decide to use a car top carrier on the trip so we would have more room for some extras. Departure is now 0-35 days and closing.   I am happy to report that Jeff, my young nephew who lives in Portland Oregon has a drivers license.  I mentioned earlier in this text that Jeff was 24 years old with no license and his presence on the trip depended on his getting one, he did and all 4 members are now ready to go. The weather has warmed up in Connecticut and training rides are going well.  Yesterday it was 90 degrees (to much to soon).  I did a 30 mile hilly ride which was a little to much in that kind of heat.  May is bicycle month but don't forget it is also May Flies Month and Mosquito month, they ate me alive yesterday while I was trying to fix a flat.  TAKE YOUR BUG SPRAY WITH YOU WHEN YOU RIDE. Yesterday I began to pack every thing that I will need for the trip.  As with any trip, I have much to much stuff and I haven't even packed clothing yet, oh well.  The good part is, packing made me feel like its almost here.  That's not true with 20 days to go but it feels good anyway.  I can't believe I got all this stuff on my bicycle for last years tour. When the trip actually begins, I will make daily entries when a computer is available.  There will be a daily entry for all 46 days eventually.  Pictures will have to be added when we return home in July. As of Friday May 25, my part of the adventure will begin.  At that time I will go to Daily entries along with "from where to where plus mileage".  The first 5 days will be driving across America and that will be an adventure in itself.  I will spend a day in Mooresville Ind. visiting with my sister then on to pick up Jerry near Carbondale Ill.  From Jerry's place we will drive straight to Portland Oregon via I-70, I-80, and then I-84 to Portland.  The estimate is that we will arrive in Portland some time in the afternoon or evening on the 30th of May.  We will then pick up Jeff and go on the Astoria where we will stay for two nights in a motel getting ready for departure on the bikes. Please don't forget to sign the guess book while you are here.
The weather in Astoria on the 30th and 31st was beautiful, sunny and  warm all day, both days. In the morning on the 31th we decided to take a short ride to the bike shop to take care of a couple of problems. When we got there the shop  did not open until 10 am so we decided to ride to Fort Clatsop which is  where Lewis and Clark wintered in 1806.  The ride to the Fort was great with sunny and warm weather.  The ride to Fort Clatsop used part of the  Trans-American bike trail so it was an opportunity of us to ride a little  of the bike trail and check out the condition of our bikes after the long ride on the back of the car.  Over all we rode more than 27 miles getting to and from the Fort. It was great, the weather was great.    When we got back to Astoria the bike shop was open, we took care of a  problem with Jeff's bike and spent the rest of the day enjoying Astoria and the warn sunny weather.  We were all very excited about the next  morning which was the official start of our trip. At first we noticed it was extremely difficult to get all four bike on the  "four bike rack".  We solved that by going to Fred Meyers and purchasing  a cheap single bike rack which we hung off the rear of the vehicle between the  four bike rack and the vehicle.  It worked well.  We knew we had a lot of stuff so we decided to do a practice run on getting  everything in, on, or hanging from the car.  We filled three parking spaces with all the equipment each of us brought.  Then we attempted to get it all in or on the car.  We managed to load the car with NO spare room, however,the car was so loaded we couldn't get at anything, including our biking clothes for the next day.  Faced with the car being so stuffed with gear, none of us were very happy about the prospects of getting our gear in and out.   THAT'S THE GOOD NEWS NOW THE BAD NEWS On the morning of June 1st it was raining very hard with high winds and  cold.  No way could we ride in that kind of weather.  So we talked and  decided to use the vehicle and go ahead and travel to Newport where friends of Jerry's lived.  The weather forecast was for several days of bad weather so even though Newport was 4 days into our trip by bike it was only a half day by car. The thinking was as long as we left the coast from Florence, we  would still be going from coast to coast so it was not important that we  ride to Florence by bike.    Being worried about getting at our gear, on the way to Newport, we spotted  a "U Haul" dealer.  They had a trailer just the right size for our vehicle which would take our bikes and most of our gear and make life on the road  so much easier.  We rented it and will drop it off in Georgia and now everyone is happy, specially Bob. We spent the evening in Newport getting a great tour of the area by Jerry's friends which included a fine "all you can eat" meal which pleased Jeff to no end, at a place with a good view of the ocean.  Dave and Mary outdid them  selves with a very good breakfast the following morning, after providing us  with good sleeping quarters for the night.  Our thanks go out to Dave and Mary for their hospitality! GUESS WHAT? Its raining again for the second day of our bike trip.  To our advantage it's supported to be our 5 day, but getting back into the car again is not making any of us very happy.  We will be ready to ride today hoping the weather  improves at some point during the day.  We are spending some additional time  with Dave and Mary hoping to wait out the rain. Stay tuned for the wonderful adventures of "Walt, Robert, Jerry, and Jeff".
  The weather on day 2 was still not good, however when we were ready to leave Newport it cleared enough to ride the bikes.  All 4 of us dipped our rear wheels in the Pacific Ocean at South Beach State Park just outside of Newport.  Dipping the bike was not easy since the parking lot and the beach was quite a walk over soft sand.  We carried our bike to avoid getting sand all over them.    The riders for the day then took off for Florence while the sag driver waited for about 30 minutes before taking off.   After 15 miles the sky opened up again and we were drenched and had to stop riding again.  We all piled into the car and drove on to Florence and got a motel and it was still raining.      
   We checked into a motel in Eugene in mid afternoon and found we had a problem with Jeff's bike.  Since it was Sunday only one of three bike shops was open.  We called the bike shop and rushed over to get the bike repaired. The female mechanic was very good at fixing bicycles and also very cute; Jeff was in love. In the evening we had diner with Wendy and Richard at a very nice restaurant brew pub.  We had a great time talking with Wendy and Richard about the lousy weather in Oregon among other things.
  What a great day! Bright and sunny and a pleasant temperature.  We started the ride beyond the city center on deserted back roads which were wonderful.  After 22 miles the back roads connected with highway 126.  The connection was far enough beyond the city to have minor traffic.  We had a great ride with a slightly up hill grade all the way to McKenzie Bridge.   The weather continued to be sunny and wonderful for the whole ride causing us to take our first camp site.  The was part of a hot springs resort complete with a lodge and cabins.  We set up our tents with some comedy because it was our first time camping.  We did laundry, went into the spa, and showered.  As we set around our camp site we noticed the clouds moving in.  The rain started while we were preparing our evening meal and did not stop for the next two days; Oregon's Weather Sucks!
   We decided to hang around for the day because we wanted to try to ride McKenzie Pass the next day if the rain stopped. We decided to check out McKenzie Pass by car since it was going to be the hardest ride yet.  The temperature when we started up the mountain was 49 degrees and dropped to 37 degrees at the top.  Jeff and Walt saw snow when they climbed to the top of the observatory.  Our decision not to ride today was a very wise one. We spent the day exploring the area and stayed at a motel in Bend because it was cheaper than Sisters.    
   From McKenzie Bridge to the top of the McKenzie Pass is 23 miles.  The first 7 miles are not very steep but the next 11 miles are "wing dingers".  Nothing but switch backs all the way.  After mile 18 the last stretch is easier.  The ride up the mountain was a four hour uphill bike ride the likes of which we had never experienced before.  The 15 miles down hill to Sisters was wonderful and welcome by all.  We all came to the conclusion that the west bounders had it easy.    The Cell Phone does not work in this area so no call home tonight. We are going out to party tonight!
   We are camping tonight at Ochoco Lake County Park.  The best campsite yet by far.  Beautiful lake with a nice view from our site.    Tonight we feasted on hot dogs, hot sausage and baked beans.  What a great meal!  If you remember the movie Mel Brookes did called "Blazing Saddles" then you know what it was like around our site later that evening. Fortunately there was not many other campers.   
     Tonight we camped in Mitchell's City Park.  Mitchell is a very friendly little town out in the middle of nowhere.  We were all set to go out to dinner when we found Mitchell had a power outage which lasted several hours.  So Bob made his famous Chili which was a replay of last nights "Blazing Saddles".  It was quite good.  While here, we visited the John Day Fossil Beds National Monument.  The fact that the area was at one time a tropical jungle fascinated everyone. We camped with John and Briar from New Zealand whom we met first at Ochoco Lake the night before.  They are a husband and wife traveling from Vancouver, BC. to Nova Scotia using the Trans-American bike route.  Two very delightful people.   
   Then we had a 33 miles downhill ride of our lives to Dayville.  We felt so good after the downhill we decided to go on to Mt Vernon for the evening where we stayed at Clyde Holliday State Park.  It seems the State campgrounds in Oregon are very nice and always have showers.    We found a laundromat in Mt Vernon which allowed us to have clean clothes again. We have observed that Jerry really misses Annalee because he is always misplacing little things and asking us to help him find them.
  It was a 47 degree day with the threat of rain when we got up this morning.  It pays to ride early.  It was level from Mt Vernon to Prairie City but then from there to Dixie Pass was very steep.  We managed to complete the ride before the rains came and complete the downhill to Austin Junction.  Because of the rain we took rooms at Sag's Motel for the night which was back in Prairie City.  Sag's was the only motel around and caters to construction crews so it was a little different than we were used to although we did sleep well.   
   Again today we started in 47 degree weather and rode with the threat of rain all day.  After the two passes totaling 20 miles of climbing it was a beautiful downhill of 31 miles to Baker City. It was a great ride except for the cold and rain in our faces.  Again because of the cold and rain we decided to take a motel.  Jerry is delighted because he has a bathtub. All riders are getting better at doing the passes now that we have done about 6.  We will continue to improve as we ride more.  Look out Rocky Mountains here we come.    
  41 degrees this morning but we do have some sun.  As we left Baker City we passed the Oregon Trail Interpretive Center which we had visited last night.  What an impressive view from their large windows of remains of the Oregon Trail.   After we passed the Interpretive Center we encounter high cross winds which gave Jeff more trouble than the rest of the riders because of their increased bulk vs Jeff.  Within several hours the cross wind turned to a tail wind and we had a great ride that followed the Powder River.    However, at one point Walt saw white caps on a farmers pond so we were glad they were tail winds.  It was a great downhill ride until we reached Richland where we had to climb a short but steep hill to get to our destination of Halfway. We camped in a barn yard (shades of last years ride) although it had showers.  The cow munching on grass near the fence and the visiting dog during the night made for interrupted sleep.  Diner at the local bowling alley was a highlight of our evening.
  Who says the 13th is bad luck, its June 13th and we have the first nice day in as many.  First 34 miles was easy riding mostly downhill to Oxbow and Brownlee Dams.  Hells Canyon is a beautiful ride.  We rode along the Canyon for about 9 miles.  At Brownlee Dam we ran into the local sheriff who thought we were out of our minds.  He was a very pleasant man.  We also crossed into Idaho at Brownlee Dam.  Then we began a 13 miles climb up Brownlee Creek to 4125 feet.  After 7 passes they all seem the same.  At the summit we coasted without having to pedal a stroke unless we wanted to. We have began to see a lot of animals, fox, deer, cows, horses and many birds. We stayed at the Frontier Hotel and Campgrounds which had showers and a Laundry which we all needed.  Dinners out here are so cheap we don't have to cook unless we want to.  Top of the menu is $9.00.    
   We rode mainly uphill today.  It was 48 miles most of which was not hard until the last part which started at Council.  We had two uphill rides which came at the end of the day making it a pain because we were tired.  The last 5 miles was downhill to New Meadows which is at about 4000 feet.     We stayed at Zim's campground and saw the remains of a burned out $75 to $100k motor home which burned just before we arrived.  The owners returned from taking their grandkids fishing only to find nothing left of their motor home.  The family just sit down and cried.  One of the residents had videotaped the fire and showed us a replay on his camcorder.  What a tragedy.    
  Today was a long day but almost all downhill except for a couple of small hills at the very end of the day.  In Riggins we ran into another deputy sheriff who also thought we were nuts.  He too was very pleasant.  When we ask him if we could ride on the side walks in Riggins, his reply was we have no rules in Idaho just don't hurt anyone.  The police and sheriffs are your friends when you are riding bikes in the middle of no where. We rode along the Little Salmon River through some of the most dramatic countryside we have ever seen.  The Little Salmon River became the Salmon River complete with white water rafting.  It must have been trout season because there were hundreds of people fishing along the highway.    We arrived at White Bird to find no room at the Inn because of the annual rodeo.  We loaded up the bikes and drove to Grangeville to get a room.  At this very moment we are using the computer of Ken, our motel owner, who kindly let us update our journal from his home computer.  Stay tuned.
   After the hill it was on to Grangeville again where we gathered up the trailer and then rode on to Kooskia through some very beautiful countryside.  The ride was all downhill so the second half of the day was easy riding.  We camped along the Clear Water River but unfortunately they were selling fire works next to the campground so it was a noisy night but we slept anyway.
  #We are still following the Clear Water River and beginning to see lots of fishing as well as white water rafting.  When we reached Lowell the river became the Lochsa which means rough waters.  We traveled 20 miles beyond Lowell and then placed the bikes in the trailer and returned to Lowell where we stayed at the Three Rivers Campground.    It was a pleasant downhill day with good weather and all the riders enjoyed it.  The countryside gets more beautiful every day.  We are all impressed with Idaho so far.  Diner was at a restaurant overlooking the Lochsa River, what a view.     
  The trip from Lowell to Powell was an all day climb to the base of Lolo Pass.  The ride continued through beautiful country and could have been the subject of a good jig saw puzzle.  Not to hard a ride but as usual it ended with a heart breaker uphill.  We don't mind the uphills but not at the end of the day. We all stayed in a cabin at the Lochsa Lodge.  It had 4 beds including Jeff's which was hung from the ceiling.  We had another evening of "Blazing Saddles" because Dixon had some beer with his dinner.  In spite of all this we got along very well and did not loose any sleep.  We started to call Bob "Mr. Magoo" because he never has his glasses on when he reads the map and we end up with some really strange mileage estimates.   
   At Lolo Pass we crossed into Montana our third state on this bike trip.  This is the Pass that Lewis and Clark had so much trouble with during their expedition.  Had it not been for the Nez Perce Indians, their expedition would have ended here.  Jerry enjoyed all the posted Lewis and Clark camp sites along the way.  Walt enjoyed Fort Fizzle.    We had less trouble than Lewis and Clark crossing Lolo Pass.  After the first 13 miles the ride was all down but with a strong head wind so it was not an absolute joy.  We arrived in Missoula around 4pm on the bike lane of a large busy highway which we were not over joyed with.  We are staying in a KOA Campground and had dinner at an all you can eat restaurant.  If everyone ate like we did at the restaurant it would go out of business.
Jerry found new tent poles to replace the broken ones that he had been repairing with tape as he would have done it on the farm.  None of us thought that he would ever find them. Jeff bought two new science fiction books so he wouldn't have to go to sleep with the old timers at 7pm. Walt also bought another book and got a new battery for his camera.   We all did our laundry, updated the web site and visited Adventure Cycling Headquarters.  After 19 days of riding our bikes all need attention so that is the last chore of today, cleaning and adjusting the bikes.
  The route today was flat with no hills to speak of.  The group made the run to Hamilton by 1pm.  From Lola to Florence Rt. 93 was under heavy construction.  Fortunately there was a new bike path the whole 9 miles to our turn off in Florence. Finding a campground was not easy.  We ended up 8 miles south of Hamilton at a family campground.  Now we will have to back track to Hamilton in the morning to start the bike ride.    We had our first flat tire today, Jeff's rear tire picked up a piece of glass.  We fixed it in 20 minutes and were on our way. We were going to be treated to Bob's famous Chili tonight but there is no picnic table so we are going to find a cheap restaurant. Walt has put his Kudos (energy bars) under lock and key.  At the beginning of the trip Walt bought plenty of Kudos and offered to share with everyone.  We all took advantage of his offer and depleted his stock.  Since no one replaced them, Walt went out and bought some more and has hidden them from the rest of us.  Not fair! (More than fair says Walt!)
Route 93 continues to be very busy between Hamilton and Darby.  These small towns are feeder towns serving the entire Bitterroot Valley.  There's a steady stream of traffic coming into and leaving each of these towns. Sula turns out to be a KOA Campground, gas station, and cafe.  The KOA was unsuitable for tents.  After checking out two other Cabin/Campsites (one of which offered to put the four of us up in a cabin for $160 which put Jerry and Bob into a state of shock) we decided to return to Darby and took a normal motel for the night.  This part of the Bitterroot Valley was hit hard by the forest fires last summer.  Some 70 homes were burned.  The fires were finally put out when winter arrived.  The route we are traveling was closed to traffic during August last summer.  Interestingly enough Morrell Mushrooms only grow the first year after a forest fire.  There are a multitude of mushroom pickers sharing the lodging facilities with us.  If they can pick a hundred pounds of mushrooms they can make $300 a day.    
At noon today we finished the first half of our 45 day ride.  23 days of riding bikes is a long time.  We expect to make Pueblo without any trouble by July 15th. The ride from the pass to Wisdom was 26 miles of mostly downhill through forest and mountain streams then into a big flat valley (Big Hole Valley).  We are still on the route that Lewis and Clark took.    Our biggest problem today was Mosquitoes.  We encounter a cloud of them when we stopped at the Big Hole Monument.  They were so bad we thought they were going to carry both the bikers and the car away.  We broke out the Off but it was not much help so we had to keep riding without stopping until we got to Wisdom and escaped into a restaurant for lunch.  After lunch we made an 18 mile nonstop ride to Jackson to escape being eaten alive.  A breeze came up and blew them away while we were in Jackson. We stayed the night at the Jackson Hotsprings Lodge in a two room cabin with 4 beds for $27 each.  It was one of the best places we stayed.  The meal was the first meal up to Walt's eastern standards.
   We stayed at a KOA Campground which had plenty of shade and to our surprise we ran into our friends from New Zealand.  John and Briar had caught up to us because we took a day off in Missoula.  It was good to see them again. We were going to cook but the winds were too great so we ate Pizza at Poppa T's in Dillon.  We enjoyed it very much and nothing was left when we finished.  The high winds we experienced last evening help keep the Mosquitoes at bay. We took the car and did a tour of Dillon which is the home of Western Montana University.  It was a pretty little college town with a beautiful campus.
  The first 20 miles today was wonderful.  We rode it in about 1 1/2 hours.  Then we turned right at Twin Bridges onto a different highway and had a head wind and an uphill stretch which challenged us all.  The slow going took the strength out of all of us and we decided to have an early lunch in Sheridan. After lunch we continued on to Alder and to our surprise we had a tail wind all the way.  We are camping at a nice KOA and Bob is finally getting to make his famous Chili again tonight.  Blazing Saddles revisited. We are all looking forward to Yellowstone Park which will come in three more days.
Virginia City is an exact reproduction of the original city from the gold rush days.  It is now a tourist attractions with all the appearances of a gold rush western town. Tonight we are sleeping at the Madison River Lodge.  What a great place and reasonable too.  Jeff Bob and Walt shared a cabin with three beds and a video player and watched the Verdict with Paul Newman.  Great flick. The big event for today was the MOLD Jeff and Bob found growing in the bottom of their water bottles.  It took bleach to get it out.  The bottles had turned black with mold.  God knows how long it was there.     
   The ride from Cameron along highway 287 was beautiful.  We followed the river  through the Madison River Canyon Earth Quake area.  In 1959 there was an earth quake which caused a mountain side to fall into the Madison River.  The results was a lake formed where there was no lake before.  19 people were killed and the Madison river was blocked causing the backed up water to form a lake.  The Corp. of Engineers cut a spillway from the lake to the other side of the slide releasing some of the water.    After Quake Lake we rode along Hebgen Lake which is one of the water storage areas for Montana.  One of the prettiest rides we have had. This afternoon we did go visit old faithful and were lucky because we did not have to wait too long to see it erupt.  We found the Golden Eagle passes that both Bob and Jerry have very useful; they got us all into the Park free. West Yellowstone is a tourist trap with all the trimmings.  We are staying at  a KOA 6 miles west of West Yellowstone which is a nice campground but very busy and a lot of kids and adults making noise until 11pm.  We will be glad to be on the road again. 
  We did the upper loop of Yellowstone today by car.  We saw the upper and lower falls and Mammoth Hot Springs (which are almost dry).  Our animal list is now as follows: Buffalo, Elk, Moose, Deer, Coyote, Bear, Trumpeter Swan and lots of tourist type animals.    The fire damage to the park is extensive.  Everywhere we went the trees were gone and very small new trees were growing.  An advantage was you get a better view of the Park as you drive but at times it was depressing.      Tomorrow we are back on the road and glad of it.
   We crossed two passes inside Yellowstone, Craig Pass at 8261 and an unnamed pass at 8391.  We also crossed the Continental Divide two times.  Both passes were the highest yet.  We are all a little concerned about the thin air as we approach 9000 ft.     
  Today we crossed Togwotee Pass at 9658 ft.  This pass is the second highest pass on the Trans-American Bike Trail.  The climb started and continued for 17 miles.  The altitude did not effect us as much as we thought it would.  I guess we are in pretty good shape at this point in our ride.  It took less than 3 hours to climb and no one had any trouble.  We are back in the high desert again.  The temp was 94 degrees in the afternoon. After the pass we had a 29 mile downhill ride into Dubois with a tail wind.  We left Moran Junction at 8:30am and were in Dubois by 1pm.  Along the way we saw the Budweiser Clydedales as they passed us in their trailers.  They then corralled outside of Dubios.  The locals we asked thought they were filming another commercial. We camped at the Circle Up Campground.  It was somewhat shaded from the 94 degree temp.  The campsite has showers and laundry.  All the things we need to stay clean.  We have been able to camp at places that have showers for the most part.  An absolute necessity.    
  For the second day in a row we are starting our ride with a tail wind.  Tail winds are next to food in order of importance to bikers.  Two in a row is a blessing. Our ride today has been through tree less terrain.  The rock formations changed as we rode.  There were some really pretty colors as we traveled on.  It was 95 degrees today and there was no shade at all not even a tree.  We tried to ride on schedule and did but the heat still got to us.   We spent the evening in Lander.  It really was an attractive city with pretty homes and a lovely canyon park.  They are having their annual rodeo event which starts tomorrow. Again we are glad we are getting out of town.
  Boy it got hot again today.  Another 95 degree day with no shade at all anywhere in route.  We got out on schedule and were finished by 1pm.  Sweetwater Station is the headquarters for the Shoshone Indians but had no sleeping facilities. We planned to stay in Jeffery City where there was one motel.  The best thing that happened was taking Jeff's picture by his city's sign.  What a place.  It looked like an abandoned military base and in fact was an abandoned Uranium processing town that once had 6000 people and now has 200.  Boarded up homes and apartments.  When the lady at the motel asked us if we had a reservation we thought we would laugh.  She wasn't kidding.  She was booked for the night with 14 Mormons and three other people so we went on to Rawlins which was the nearest town with accommodations. The heat and the desert conditions are getting to all of us.  The roads go on in a straight line for a long ways and are very boring to ride on.  Most of us find this type of riding to be no fun.   
We left Rawlings this morning on schedule and rode along I80 for 13 miles.  This is the first time we had ridden on an Interstate Highway.  We found it very difficult getting the bicycles up to speed with the traffic in order to merge (joke).  At first everything was fine as we rode along the shoulder but then we came to some construction and we were forced to ride within inches of the 65 mile an hour traffic mostly heavy trucks.  Quite scary.    After we got off the Interstate we had a 20 mile ride through the hot Wyoming desert to Saratoga.  Tonight we are staying in a motel and plan to be out of town before the fourth of July parade starts tomorrow morning. Today was Walt's Birthday and he rode with his very loud US Postal Shirt in celebration.  Go Lance Go.
Tonight we are staying in Riverside.  Jeff and Walt went to the local fireworks display at Encampment, CO.  The show was quite interesting.  The locals set off the longest display of fireworks we had ever seen, over an hour.  However, the debris falling upon the two girls in front of us and the rocket that went off sideways and hit the baseball backstop, led to some concern.  It was almost as dangerous as riding I80 but Jeff and Walt survived.  This fireworks display will be remembered forever.
   Again today was hot in the high desert with mostly flat terrain.  We had a narrow shoulder but not too much traffic so the ride was pleasant.  The terrain was sage brush and grass, cow country. There was no place to stay so we moved forward to Kremmling.  In Kremmling we had a very nice camp site at a trailer park with real green grass which we rented for two nights.  Tomorrow we will have to go back to Colorado Creek to start our ride where we left off.  We will actually end our ride in Kremmling tomorrow night. We found the food in Kremmling to be not too good.  In fact we have had trouble getting good food lately.
Because of the bad food we have been getting Jeff was going to cook for us this evening in Kremmling but thunder and lightening with heavy winds caused us to have to go out and eat again, not good.   Tomorrow its on to Dillon/Silverthorne and all the tourists and traffic.
  The bad shoulders with heavy traffic continued today.  In order to avoid at least some of the traffic we decided to go around Green Mountain Reservoir costing us an extra 4 miles and several steep up hills but the scenery was great and the traffic was non existent.  But all good things come to an end and we had to get back on the poor roads to finish the ride into Dillon.    One good thing about the heavy tourist area of Dillon was some good restaurants and we took advantage of it.  Dinner was at a nice Italian restaurant with great food.  The first real food we have had in a number of days. We did a preview of Hoosier Pass (11542 ft.) and it scared the hell out of all of us.
  We had beautiful bike paths all the way from Dillon to Breckenridge (19 miles) which made the ride a pleasure because it avoided all the tourist traffic.  Once we started up the pass the weather began to get cloudy and got worse the higher we climbed.  About 3 miles from the top all hell broke loose with cold rain and hail balls the size of peas (some larger).  It was like mother nature was trying to tell us not to climb her pass.  We didn't listen and keep on climbing with our rain gear on and finally made it to the top (11542 ft., the highest on the Trans-American Trail) wet and cold.  This was the first wet weather we have had to ride in since Oregon.    Show links to this Hide links to this       July 8, 2001   Tonight we are in Fairplay, a very interesting little town, complete with a rebuilt western style town museum.  We did some shopping and wandered around town until dinner and had another bad meal. Tomorrow its on to Canon City.
  Today was one of the most beautiful rides we have had with bright sunshine and clear skies.  The first 16 miles was uphill but after we crossed Currant Creek Pass (9404 ft.) it was a great downhill ride.  The scenery was beautiful with Fir trees, rolling hills and flowing brooks.  While we haven't eaten yet, we are hoping that Canon City is large enough to have a better choice of food than we have been experiencing.  Bob claims he can feel his arteries closing a little more every day eating local food. This was our next to last day since we will be in Pueblo tomorrow.  We all are excited about going home but will miss all the different experiences we have had every day.
After the ride we drove to Colorado Springs where we picked up a motel room, showered, and headed by car for Pikes Peak.  The trip up Pikes peak was highlighted by the car over heating on the way up the mountain.  We stopped and waited for the car to cool and made it the rest of the way up the mountain.  What a great view from the top.  Well worth all the effort. This is our last day and ends our trip for this year. Thanks to all who sent us messages, we enjoyed them very much.  Tune in next year for the continuation (maybe) of our adventure. Jerry, Jeff, Bob, and Walt.
We stopped in Tamaroa dropped off Jerry and had dinner with his lovely wife and daughter.  Jeff and Walt were very impressed with the size of Jerry's farm.  They had been hearing about it for 40 days and now had a tour of the entire facilities including the grain bins and how they work. The following morning (the third day) we headed for Cumming, Georga to drop off Walt.  We arrived in Cumming at about 4:30 pm and found a place to drop off the U-Haul after empting it of all our gear.  We would never have made it without the U-Haul, it was a trip saver.  We had already taken off the plastic carrier from the roof of the car in Tamaroa (it belonged to Jerry).  We spent the night with Walt and left for Port Jervis N.Y. and Bethany CT the following morning (the fourth day).  We got on the road at 6:30 am and arrived in Port Jervis at about 9:30 pm.  The ride from Port Jervis is about 2 hours so I arrived home at 11 pm.  Its well over 900 miles from Cumming to Bethany so it was a long day. The ride was great allowing us to see some of the most beautiful country in the world at a very slow pace.  While we have not made any plans for next summer, I'm sure that all of us will be back on bicycles doing some kind of ride ever if its not together. Thanks to all who visited our site and left messages, we loved them.  Happy riding.

Hey I dont mind I have had the best meals in 2 months.... Glenn has this thing about going to a restraunt for breakfast...... it does not matter if we have to ride 10km or 60km, he still stops for breakfast, bacon, eggs, toast, pancakes....the works!!!!!!! We are now travelling along the Bulkley River, the Hazelton Mountains are on one side...... Lots of high peaks, snow capped, the highest peak in this group Mt Cronin (2,386m)...... The ride is really nice, shit hot!!!!, if fact........

The seven sisters, a group of snow capped mountains, are absolutely spectacular, they have glaciers...... Had a nice climb today.... Hungry Hill, 6 mile climb to 844 m, not bad.....

A required motel evening because it was the final game of the Stanley Cup and one of the guys (who shall remain nameless) was not about to miss seeing his man Ray Bourque's last bid for the Cup after his 22 years in the game.  Matt enlightened Phil and Chad (admitted hockey ignoramuses) on the finer points of the game so we could all enjoy this historic event a little more.  Congrats Ray!  We're sure the folks back in Boston enjoyed that moment too.    
Crossed our first time zone en route to Wisconsin so we reset our clocks to transport us to that magical place known as the 'Central Time Zone'.  Took some photos at the Welcome to Wisconsin sign and checked out the visitors center for route ideas to take us across Wisconsin.  We were all struck at how beautiful, green, and clean Wisconsin appeared and, especially in comparison with Michigan (no offense Michigan), how well maintained and marked the roads were...the local county roads which we prefer for cycling are lettered so our route would be something like count road A to P to X to C to XX to CS, etc Started to rain on us shortly after we hit the road and continued to soak us silly.  We hit our 1,000 mile mark and shortly after we came upon a smiling moose - actually 'The Smiling Moose', a bar and grill in the unincorporated town of Osman.  A woman on the porch next door suggested that we should stop a spell as music was about to begin and she even offered to let us put our bikes in the garage - couldn't pass up the opportunity to hear some local music, dry out a bit, and christen our 1000 mile marker with a beer.  Listened to some blues and rock by the Brent Anderson band from New Orleans before getting back on the road - the weather had cleared up quite a bit and the rest of the ride was absolutely gorgeous through rolling farmlands and no shortage of cows (in addition to being Chad's birthplace, Wisconsin, the Badger State, is of course 'America's Dairyland').  We started looking for places to camp and a guy on an ATV (the second fully intoxicated ATV pilot we had encountered) offered to let us pitch tents in his yard.  Decided this may not be the best place for us to lay our heads so pushed on to what may have been the buggiest place on earth in a park whose defining feature was a marsh with very social mosquitoes who wanted to get to know us intimately.  Quickly set up tents and called it a night.         

A tornado is something that, for those of us in the Northeast, is just a word or a movie effect.  We'll get back to that.   We pulled into town and grabbed a little cottage, by chance, and settled in.  Soon it was time for some eats and possibly a beer.  I was on the tired side so I decided to stay at the cottage, try to write a bit, and sleep.   Chad and Phil were interested in a little taste of local culture and decided to head on out for some nosh.  As I walked outside with them chatting about the next day I noticed an impressive storm front moving in.  We had heard about it but did not pay it much attention as we had weathered much already and foolishly thought we knew what was coming.  Thunderstorm Warning, by Northeast standards, don't require much prep other than the preparation for rain.  We were inside, so we were all set.  There was one other phrase tagged onto the warning, Tornado Watch.  Something that in my mind was still just an academic phrase, certainly not reality.  The radio voice also went through the explanation that this only meant that the conditions were right and not that there was one or would be one.  Anyway, as Phil and Chad left I proceeded about 200ft from the front of our cottage to the lakefront, to watch the storm roll in.  The line of clouds moving in were impressive and I thought I could get the chance to see a rain line move in over the lake.  The storm cloud front was also shaped like a phoenix with each wing tip stretching out to the horizon on either side (very cool).  It was dark now and very calm.  I was watching hundreds of little winged insects swarming a light very close to where I was.  The bugs were also all around and I was thinking about getting my camera and bug repellant when the wind just picked up.  Within five seconds there was a steady 15 - 20 mph wind and I had just enough time to think 'Great the bugs will go away'.  10 seconds later it was a strong 25 - 35mph wind. Again I had just enough time to think 'Wow this is really cool' when in less than another 10 seconds the wind had increased to 40 - 50 mph.  My mind now went quickly from 'This is Cool' to 'This may not be good'.  Maybe it was just an experiential comparison that caused alarm, where I had never felt wind increase so fast.  I know it was this quick because my mind had barely enough time to process the information.  There was a gust, on top of the steady wind, that knocked me back and my eyes fell on the water.  The water was churning in all directions where literally only moments ago it was calm.  Alarm turned to fear and I turned to make quick haste back to the cottage.  After about fifty feet the driving rain just appeared almost instantly soaking me and I was certain the wind had increased even more.  The wind was whipping in all directions and branches were breaking off the trees as I ran.  This is when that abstract word came back to me, tornado.  With the wind whipping and the rain driving and the water churning I remembered I was somewhere that tornadoes actually happened.  If this wasn't enough to scare the strength out of my knees, the rowboat that flew 6 feet in the air, 25 feet across a little inlet was.  By the way, I know it was 6 feet off the ground because I am 6 feet tall.  A flying rowboat, eye level, has a special effect on someone who is already trying to remember where you go in a tornado.  I covered the last 100ft in about 3 steps.  Oh and sometime between when I started running for the cottage and when I arrived the lights all went out.  When I opened the outer door of the cottage the wind caught it and knocked me off the porch.  I ran in and closed all the windows but the inside of the cottage was already ransacked.  I got a flashlight and realized that it had been a few minutes it had been a few minutes and I wasn't on my way to OZ.  Maybe no tornado.  But serious weather and it finally occurred to me that Chad and Phil were somewhere out in it (finally is a relative term, it had only been 5 minutes since I was standing serenely on the shore).  I threw on rain gear, grabbed the headlamp, and headed in the direction they came.  Self-composed-movie-based-tornado theory has it that one white guy alone will definitely get sucked up.  I found them hurtling down the road not too far off and we all raced back to the cottage where .I locked us out.  It took a few moments of recovery from what a bonehead move that was to remembering I didn't lock the windows when I shut them.  Chad, apparently sharing my alarm, began to climb in the window behind me when Phil reminded him I would soon open the door.  Phil on the other hand was having a good laugh.   We survived but the next day 75mph gusts were reported and a state of emergency was declared for the area around where we were due to the damage.  Also, about 3 miles from where we started, there was a fifty foot wide path of destruction that snapped and uprooted big trees, trashed a barn, and flipped and tossed very large farm equipment.  They called it straight line wind, possibly up to 125mph
  
  
      
The categories are Consumption, Flyby, Impact, and what we will call the Amplifier.  These are all equally intriguing and fascinating patterns of Human Bug Interaction (HBI).  They are patterns because they happen 50 - 100 times a day. CONSUMPTION.  Consumption has 3 sub categories, Hole in One, Chew, and Lucky Bastard.  Hole in One, refers to biking with your mouth open and getting any variety of insect types to fly right down the old pie hole.  No questions, no chances, no alternatives but to swallow immediately.  The Chew is when the bug does not fly as true and comes to rest in the midmouth.  This results in the reflexive mouth close and a good chance of starting the chewing process.  The size of the bug is directly related to the crunch factor.  The Lucky Bastard is very rare but observed on several occasions.  This is when the bug flies into the foremouth, is not chewed, is spit back out, and miraculously flies away unharmed. FLYBY.  The Flyby is visually impressive.  It involves usually bigger bugs that head right for your face and at the last minute veer off to miss only by fractions of an inch.  This is very common and can suggest purely by the frequency that it is purposeful.  Maybe a bug initiation of sorts.  The more exaggerated the duck and dodge by the Human results in more prestige for the Bug.  This is a dangerous maneuver, if miscalculated it will lead to the next category  IMPACT.  Impact has 4 subcategories, Single Impact, Ricochet, Multiple Impact, and Bulls eye.  The Single Impact is self-explanatory.  One bug + One hit = No Bug & One welt.  Ricochet can take many forms or combinations.  There is the Cheek/Elbow/Thigh combo.  The bicep/other bicep/neck combo.  The knee/thigh/chin combo, etc etc.  It isn't known how many bugs survive these impacts, as there is never any sign of life or death.  The Multiple Impact is just a swarm of bugs impacting either singly or ricochet at near exactly the same moment.  The Bulls eye is one of the most painful and involves one large bug and a single impact on the tip of the nose.   AMPLIFIER.  Without question the most unnerving of the interactions.  The Amplifier is when any size bug gets caught either directly or after a ricochet between your helmet strap and your ear.  The size of the bug does not matter as the proximity to your ear makes it sound like Mothra has landed on your head.  Flailing and violent head shaking is the usual result with irrational certainty that the bug will crawl into your ear for safety and that it is a bee.  This never happens but when the Amplifier occurs you always have the same reaction, same intensity.   Thank you for your time,  One of 3 Guys Biking

Sunrise or Sunset Your Eyes Relaxation Peripheral Vision Here's how: -  Just before Sun is either rising in the east or setting in the west, take a moment to get into a comfortable relaxed state (as much as possible).  Empty your mind of distractions for just a moment or two.  For the rest of the instructions we will use the instance that the sun is setting but both work just as well. -  Don't look directly at the Sun.  When the sun is in contact with the horizon look to the left or the right keeping the Sun in your peripheral vision.  You may need to change your point of reference occasionally to see the Sun clearly in your peripheral.  Also, nights that have a not so bright Sun work best. -  At this point, if you are relaxed and relatively motionless, you can probably see the Sun setting, or in other words moving toward the horizon.  It is easiest to see this right at Sunset as the horizon accents the sun disappearing.  The horizon need not be flat or natural.  This can be done in the city or anywhere there is a defined horizon.  Actually the more there is on the horizon to show the relative movement of the earth and the sun, the better. -  This is sort of time sensitive, in that you must slow down time in your mind.  You can't see the sun setting in real time, you must watch over the course of a few minutes and you will see the differences (still in your peripheral vision).  If you slow down the run time in your head you will see the sun moving.  -  Now here is the tricky part (you must still be relaxed, even relax the muscles in your face).  Once you have a good sense of the sun moving then, at this point (not earlier), remind yourself that the Sun is not moving the earth is.  Remember that the earth is rotating away from the sun.  Don't try to see it, just know it.  Don't think about it, just let the reality settle in.  Stay with the slow run time in your mind and let what you see in your peripheral wind around what you know.  It won't happen right away but all of a sudden the Sun will stop moving and the earth will start rotating. Try it it's fun.  PS - No drugs of any kind are needed :)

After our talk, Chad and I pedaled out of town, both of us turning oven and over in our minds the information that Matt had shared with us.  I was in a foul mood and the coal mine with the tourist overlook that we cycled passed did not hold my interest.  From there on Chad and I biked separately for 30 miles.  There were no towns, few houses and the only store was one selling custom guns. Then we came upon the town of Spotted Horse.  The town is surrounded by open land and ranches, but has had a history of oil, coal and now, in the last couple of years, methane being drilled from these rolling hills.  The methane boom has brought more money to the area but at an environmental and community cost.  Troy, who came down the road on a 1963 John Deere tractor, told me that he hates the entire industry.  The ranchers feel forced to allow pumping on their property since the government often own mineral rights on the land (40 acres and a mule minus the minerals?). They get paid good money but mining pollutes the water that they desperately need.   The one thing that has not changed in Spotted Horse since 1924, is that there is a bar (that's the only thing there).  I will not bore you with all the bar stories, although I will say that the owner Dr. J. (who is at the bar more than he is behind it) and the two bar maids, Babe (who had a tattoo of a large mosquito that read "bite me") and Bull's Eye, took good care of us.  We slept in the field out back.        
    
For the first time in over 5 weeks, the 3 guys are sleeping in three different locations. Matt is in Cody, Chad went ahead to Shell and I decided to spend the night on the mountain.  As I hiked up a trail I ran into John, a local coming the other way. He sent me to this meadow to watch for Moose and Elk, none yet...          
    
1) 'I regretfully must inform all of you that I am not going to make it to the Pacific' 2) 'It is my great pleasure to inform all of you that I made it all the way to Wyoming' As you can see both statements are true and both statements are loaded with emotion, albeit contradicting.  I'm afraid that the one thing that they both say is that I am going home.  I am very proud of my accomplishment but at the same moment exceedingly disappointed that I will not make it to the other side with Phil and Chad.  Actually all things considered (40 lbs overweight when we started, minimal training, not an avid biker, etc) I have no idea how I made it this far.  I knew the pace we set was difficult in theory but I didn't realize how intensely difficult it would be in practice.  A typical day for me ended with complete exhaustion and the last two weeks contained many days that ended with exhaustion to the point of collapse.  Like my bike seat in the beginning of the trip I just figured that the exhaustion was the name of the game and that I would be stronger by the time we hit the mountains.  No doubt I am stronger now but by daily bringing myself to the outer edge of my physical capability I seem to have used up all my stored 'after-you-can't-go-any-further' energy (which I drew upon constantly).  I have never done any long distance anything, that required me to test my physical limits and I didn't know when, where, or how I would hit that fabled wall.  I waited for it on many a day, knowing that I was continually over extended.  My mistake was that I expected it to hit and just stop that day's effort.  I did not know, that for me, it would build up and stop the trip.  I am truly and completely exhausted.  Wyoming is quite a feat and there is no question that I have given all that I have to give (and more) but it will be difficult to sort out the feelings of accomplishment from the feelings of disappointment.  In order to complete a task of this size you must be quite focused and goal oriented.  The backlash to this is that if you don't make it, it is very difficult to not think of it as a failure.  I have taken a few extra rest days to try and sort all this out and to see if I could recharge, to see if I could finish at this pace.  As much as I don't want to believe it I have taken myself past my limit.   But on the other hand, what a limit!  I have never challenged myself to close to this level and I made it to Wyoming!  Phil and Chad could not have been better people to attempt this with (I was already of the opinion that they are two of the finest people on the planet).  They have been beyond supportive (they came up with more options; they could carry my gear, they could block the headwinds, they could pull me, they could carry me etc).  They have been the first to point out that just getting out here and giving it a shot is worthy of great pride.  And, although I didn't think it would be, it is.  There is quite a rush associated with having tried something so difficult.  I used to think that it was rationalization for people who didn't finish and maybe it is, but there is also a great feeling associated with just having got my fat ass and trying. If this were easy everyone would do it.  If you haven't stopped to consider the enormity of the whole trip and the level of difficulty still left for Phil and Chad to overcome, then do it now and stay tuned to the web.  Send encouragement via the guestbook on this site, it is great to get and believe me they will need it.  Obviously my heart is with them and I am sorry that my body is not.  Great Thanks to everyone who helped and supported me in this.  I surely would not have gone as far as I did with out you.   And then there were two.
In the late afternoon, once rest day business was complete, Chad and I went for an early dinner.  We ate at Irma's, the restaurant that was built by Buffalo Bill himself and named after his daughter.   Again blindly following local culture I had a buffalo burger.  It tasted much like a beef burger, but the thought of it was heavy as I explored the Buffalo Bill Historical Center. The white man wiped out 30 million Buffalo (bison) in a 30-year period.  Buffalo Bill is credited with brining the west to the rest of the world with his 'Wild West' tours at the turn of the century.  Although Bill's show presented a stereotypical image of cowboys and Indians, his thinking was apparently more progressive.  Bill is quoted as speaking out for the rights of Native Americans, the rights of women (Wyoming was the first territory to allow women to vote) and against the white man's mass destruction of the buffalo.  Wick and I re-grouped that evening at the salon for a couple of 'fat tire' ales before heading back to our 'OK Corralle' campsite.
      
By the side of the road I saw a moose grazing, having his morning meal.  Two or three cars had pulled to the side of the road to watch as well.  I stood by my bike and listened as someone approached the moose trying to get that perfect photo. 'That's always the problem, they just keep their heads down.  You can't get a good shot of them' said someone in a truck.  The person in the field whistled, coo-ed and clucked hoping to get a smile from the moose.   Having seen enough, I continued on.  Later after two tour buses arrived at the West Thumb geyser basin shortly after we did, I came up with an idea.  I proposed that once a week the national park should institute a quiet visiting day - a day in which no one could say a word while they were in the park.  Chad, being uncharacteristically argumentative (maybe after 6 weeks, he would like me to keep more of my thoughts to myself), responded that such a policy would unfairly discriminate against humans.   I thought back on our breakfast this morning, we didn't say much but the birds and the little creatures of the wilderness did make a lot of noise.  In particular there was this one bird that perched itself no more than 3 feet above our picnic table that chirped and coo-ed as we ate.   Maybe he was sending out the message 'I have two early risers here at J-446, with some scrap potential.  One bag of Life cereal with a small hole in it and another bag of granola, stand-by for future updates...'  So maybe Chad is right, we may be at a disadvantage if forced to stay silent.   Before lunch we passed the Continental Divide - twice, which of course means that we are on the wrong side of it and we will be crossing it again, which means more climbing. The divide is the line (which is by no means straight) that separates the watershed.  Water that falls on one side of the line will flow out to the Gulf of Mexico via the Missouri and the Mississippi Rivers, while water on the other heads out to the Pacific via the Snake and the Columbia Rivers.  We squirted our water bottles to test this  Old Faithful lived up to its name for us.  We decided that we would have this as a lunch stop and try to view an eruption while we were there.  Right after we pulled up we learned that she was predicted to blow again in 10 minutes.  Sure enough gushes of water and steam shot up into the sky 40-50 feet. After lunch we toured the Old Faithful Inn, which had been built in 1904 for those who were both adventurous and rich.  The wooden inn is massive (traveling with a preservationist, I will not even try to describe it).  On our ride out we saw a couple of buffalo right beside the road (- did I mention that these are 2,000 pound animals?) and 3 mule deer walking up a stream.    We crossed the line out of the park and into West Yellowstone, Montana and celebrated the 4th complete with an all you can eat pasta night and fireworks.                 
  
Per usual Chad and I took care of the rest day business; web, route plan and laundry.  Having not run into any snags along the way we finished in the early afternoon.  With extra time on our hands we visited the town museum to help unravel some of the questions that we had. One major factor in making this town what it is today is the Teton flood of 1976.  Long story short is that the Bureau of Reclamation had a dam built that was complete in '75, the environmentalists opposed it, and some engineers apparently made some miss calculations.  It burst, sending a wave of something like 80 billion gallons of water out into the Snake River Valley; thousands of animal livestock killed, farms destroyed, buildings floated away and quite remarkably only 11 human deaths.  The other major piece of information that we learned at the museum was the importance of Mormons in shaping this area.  In the 1870s and 1880s Mormons faced persecution, leading them to disperse and develop their own schools.  One such school, Ricks College, based here in Rexburg, was the largest private 2-year college in the country.  Recently it became part of Brigham Young University.  Being tourists in Mormon territory caused us to be on the look out for polygamists.  As we ate dinner at a Mexican restaurant and celebrated by drinking virgin Pina Coladas, we thought that we may have spotted some, but sorry, no photos  Thank you to all who sent happy birthday wishes -- both those received and un-received.    Rach, I can almost taste those vegan cookies .
    
Wick had been sick.  He spent the day in bed.   I slept on the floor and had the longest sleep of the year, and then in the afternoon, took an additional two-hour nap.  When I wasn't sleeping I went to the hospital to see if they had any free insight and then shopping for soup and crackers.   Not much more except bad TV.
Caught up with Phil about 20 miles down the road at Craters of the Moon National Monument.  My stomach decided I needed to sit down for a bit and not move which gave me some time to take in the weird landscape stretched out before me.  "Craters" was one of the places NASA astronauts visited in the '60s when they were looking for an encounter that might help prepare them for the moon.  In 1924, Calvin Coolidge signed a proclamation creating the COTM National Monument to preserve volcanic formations, plant and animal life, and other natural and cultural features unique to this site.  Often described as "weird", "beautiful", "unearthly", all appropriate terms, it is a place that becomes a unique experience for everyone who visits, especially if you actually go beyond the Visitor Center and do the 7 mile loop road.  In my current state of malaise I regretfully declined the extra miles.  I would carry on to a place called Picabo where I would meet Phil who stayed back to get the full Craters experience.  Had an absolute dream ride - pretty much all downhill and really interesting landscape showcasing similar features we saw back at Craters and high desert flora and fauna.  Phil arrived at the caf/grocery/gas store in Picabo and with him came the rain.  This part of Idaho had been experiencing a major drought and the proprietor thanked us for bringing some relief after we told her of our rainmaking powers discovered earlier in the trip.  She told every farmer who came in that we were the one's to thank/pay.  Pretty funny - very nice people.  Now that our miracle work was done we pushed on to Stanton Crossing - just off route 20 skirting the south edge of the Sawtooth National Forest - and took advantage of its free camping sites.  Rain continued a good part of the night but broke at least long enough for us to set up tents and climb inside to relative dryness - or perhaps we MADE it stop just long enough hmmm      
Although desolate, the area had a familiar history.  It was a place where the new Americans and the Native Americans clashed.  In the morning we passed a plaque commemorating the Bannock War of 1878.  The inscription was clear that members of the Bannock tribe waged their attack as a result of the treaty that they had signed with the U.S government being violated numerously. The discovery of gold in the area and the path of the Oregon Trail by way of the Goodale Cutoff, were two of the reasons why the treaty had not been honored.   The landscape was rugged, desert scrub not more than 18" tall is the only thing that grows.  At times there seemed to be no pattern to the hills and mountains.  Riding in the valley floor there was a sea of rounded and jagged peaks that surrounded us.  I must say I was grateful that there was a road. Wick kept his struggle to himself.  I encouraged him to eat and drink, and he persevered.  Our destination was Mountain Home; its warm welcoming name may have helped our motivation.  And that, I learned was the intent.  In the days that gold was being mined in this area, as to not discourage potential workers from coming the name of the stagecoach stop was changed from Rattle Snake Creek Crossing to Mountain Home.  After arriving, we did have a fantastic dinner (which included an Oreo milkshake for me, Chad drank water in an effort to recover) at a restaurant honoring the original name.

Downtown Boise is very walkable and a downright pleasant place in which to relax and explore.  Did some Bento (a really nice change) for lunch followed by a walking tour to get a better sense of this place.  It's one of those cities that successfully maintains a small town ambience so it just feels comfortable.  Boise sits along the Boise River between the foothills of the Rockies and the high mountain desert.  Its name is derived from the French "les bois" meaning "the woods" and is why the city is known as "The City of Trees" (you were wondering, right?).  Incorporated as a City in 1864 and proclaimed the Capital of the Idaho Territory its Capital Building, a replica of our nation's Capital, was completed in 1886. One of the things we liked a lot about Boise is that it seems to actively encourage people to "go by bike" (the Chamber of Commerce guide notes that bicyclists are "expected" downtown).  The citywide bus system called BUS (Boise Urban Stages) runs on compressed natural gas and has buses equipped with bike racks - maybe not so unusual but people actually use them.  It is also a city that has a lively cultural and arts scene with bars, nightclubs, coffee houses, museums, galleries, etc all in all a neat little city that we'd like to come back and explore some more.         
The day started in all the normal ways for a traveler, pack up and leave this town for the next.  Heading out of Boise we found that the town continued on in the direction that we were going, northwest.  Urban sprawl would be too strong to describe this since its suburbs, small towns and lots of farmland.  The point is that there were people, which recently has been uncommon.  Another uncommon experience was that the wind was not dead against us.  It seemed to come from a lot of different directions, but it was more favorable than foul. We past a replica of an 1834 British fur trading post and read more about the struggles between the Native Americans and the new settlers.  The little voice had been quiet (or perhaps the other voices had been louder) until Chad and I met up together at a road juncture.  Chad had been waiting since our plan was to turn here and cross the state line.  I joked about continuing on so that we could ride through the town of Fruitcake, but we took the turn.  This was our last state crossing, but the line itself turned out to be disappointing.  It was wimpy little sign just past a brownish looking river and there was a sugar factory in the background.  Immediately the tune (different than the little voice) "Is that all there is?  If that's all there is my friend, then let's keep dancing" played in my head.  We did the obligatory line crossing activities and went into the town of Nyssa.  We ate at the Twilight Lounge, which did not fulfill our stomachs but did get us re-oriented.  As I sat in the booth realizing that I was now hungrier after lunch than before, a guy from the next table asked where we were going.  He had a large bourbon bottle, which Chad reckons was sun tea, and was playing Lotto.  But within a minute of him saying 'bad roads and hills' we changed our route.  We were out the door, crossing the state line back into Idaho, heading to that intersection, and off to Fruitcake  Later we did cross the state line back into Oregon.  It felt more right this time.  But the lack of substance from the lunch was starting to wear on me.  We were working our way down the Snake River; there were farms but no towns.  When we had crossed the line I had mentioned to Chad how good a root beer float would taste.  As I biked this fantasy  desire  need, grew inside of me.  Around each corner I looked hoping to find a town, a diner or just a gas station.  Finally up ahead I saw a building that looked like it was too close to the road to be a house.  As I got closer, but still a half mile away, I thought I saw a Coke machine.  I wondered if it was the little voice or my big stomach drawing me to this building.   Once I was close enough I could read the window;  VERN'S COUNTRY E(nter) T(oo) C(ee) The caf was closed, but Vern, in the convenience store, after hearing of our yearnings, took some root beer and Oreo ice cream (no vanilla) from the coolers and went into the backroom to make our floats.  After hearing about our travels, she asked us to sign her guest book and gave us a ceramic angel to guide us along the way.  Shortly after leaving the land changed again, to desert like hills on both sides of the river, the color of camel backs. We pitched our tents at a park named Oasis.               
Our only other stop today was for a cow jam - literally a herd of cows just hanging out in the middle of the road.  They were being separated by those that had been branded, vaccinated, registered for the draft, etc. and those that hadn't, and this required their temporary takeover of the entire road.  We waited patiently and Phil inquired about the process, chatting up the friendly cowgirl (for lack of a better term) who towered over us on her very impressive horse named Poopsalot (well that should have been its name).  Once the cow jam cleared she offered us sodas from her cooler which we thankfully accepted as there had been no services along the entire route today.  She said we should stop by and say hi to her mom who was having a yardsale today up ahead in the town of Pleasant Valley, a place that used to boast a motel, gas station, grocery, and post office but today seems to consist of nothing more than said yardsale.  Funny, and sad, how places grow and prosper and then fizzle out to mere shadows of their former selves.  Place morphology could have been a great topic of in-depth research on this trip - maybe next time For now we're just happy to have finally made it to our LAST rest day of our transcontinental crossing - now to explore Baker City and ice some sore muscles and joints (not in that order).      
Baker City is a town trying to hold on to its history and get the interest of tourists.  About 7 miles out there is the Oregon Trail Interpretive Center.  It is on top of Flagstaff Hill, alongside the trial itself. Since there was no public transportation (then or now), I hitch hiked to the museum (The ride there was great; a friendly river guide picked me up. The ride back was not as comfortable, I shared the back seat with two small dogs, and a large wet spot, which I tried to avoid.)  I came away from the Oregon Trail story in awe.  In awe of its magnitude - it may have been the largest voluntary migration in the world, an estimated 300,000 travelers.  In awe of the challenge - the trip from Missouri was 2,000 miles long and took 5-6 months; one in ten people died along the way, an average of one gravesite every 80 yards!  And in awe of how it shaped world history - the concept of 'manifest destiny', the demise of the Native Americans and the political struggles between the U.S and the European powers.  After returning to town, continuing in our effort to not think about biking, Wick and I went to micro-brew pub for supper.       
After the first two passes we stopped at the one and only store in Austin Junction where we dined on some particularly unsatisfying microwave ham and cheese sandwiches.  Still, we were thankful for the water stop before our final pass which climbed gradually before dropping us down into Prairie City, the downhill portion rewarding us with a striking vista of Strawberry Mountain - and then on to John Day where we provisioned for dinner (cheap pasta) and breakfast (cheap granola) supplies at the local Thriftymart.  While we were glad to finally reach the state park where we would camp for the night we were both struck by how overrun it was with RVs, motorcycles, and people in general.  Phil was particularly troubled over the fact that the designated 'hiker/biker' site, provided by state parks for backpackers and bicyclists exclusively, was filled with motorcycle tourers.  Later we discovered they did receive permission to camp there but it was the principle of the thing (we bicyclists can sometimes take on a holier- than-thou attitude when it comes to these things - but hey, we don't ask for much).       
    
  
I got the break that I needed at lunch.  Chad and I sat on the lawn outside of a DOT building and each ate three avocado, sprout and cheese, bagel sandwiches.  As we were getting ready to leave, a forestry truck pulled up and a guy name Jim offered to give us the 'beta' on what lies ahead, saying that the other side of Hood was 'likely to be snaughty' (outdoor enthusiast lingo that we had not heard for a long, long time).  Although he invited us to stay at his place, we got 'dialed up' and 'grinded on through'. At Government Camp, 4000' up Mt. Hood, we could see nothing and someone commented that it looked like it was snowing.  Somehow I was buoyed by this. Wick and I layered up for our descent; 6 miles of 6% grade ('a hypotenuse slide').  Gliding at 30 MPHs we quickly popped through the cloud that clung to the mountain.  We pitched our tents at Camp Creek and had an early dinner (me: a box of mac and cheese mixed with a jar of salsa, Chad: turkey sandwich and a candy bar), so that I could get a hike in.  Finally off the expressway, I could hear the river water flowing, the wind in the trees and I remembered where I was.          
  
Our morning routine long perfected, Chad and I left Bret and Linda's shortly after 6:00 A.M.  We rode across the Hawthorne Bridge under gray skies, exactly the type of weather that East Coaster's stereotype this region as having constantly.  There was no sign of Mt. Hood, and I doubted its existence.  But biking through downtown was a pleasant surprise; there were functional bike lanes.  We were passed by some businessmen commuting to work - what a concept!  But the roads became less biker friendly as we peddled up the hills out of the city and discovered that many people commute out from Portland.  Eventually we found ourselves back in rural countryside and surrounded by farm land.  By this point I was hungry again, and not knowing if we would find anything else along the way, we stopped at a convenience store for some microwaved oatmeal.   We had only two challenges ahead of us, climbing up the coastal range and then getting ourselves to the Ocean.  Climbing the 1600' was not a problem, but reaching the Pacific was elusive.  Both of our maps showed a paved road off route 26 that would bring us to Manzanita.  The Oregon bike map had it coded as green for biker friendliness.  Both of us were caught up in the spirit of the road - winding its way through the state forest following the Nehalem River to the sea; it was the road less traveled.  But we had second thoughts when the locals didn't know the road, and those that did couldn't remember if it was paved. Nonetheless, we were assured that even if it wasn't paved, 'it was a great road for bikes.'  It wasn't.  A great road for mountain bikes, yes.  A great road for aluminum framed, fully loaded touring bikes, no.  14 miles of dirt, gravel, bumps and rocks. It seemed as though we had now completely betrayed the bikes (they do have feelings, right?).  We had rode for thousands of miles with no mechanical problems to speak of, and now to finish with this.  Fortunately, we make it back to a paved surface without a mutiny or breakdown.   Maybe because of all this it didn't feel like the last day.  It didn't feel like journey's end.  In the last quarter mile of this 93-mile day, as the trip odometer turned to 3,500, we saw the Pacific for the first time.  The sun sparkled over the gentle shore break, we pushed our bicycles through the soft sand and laughed as the water rushed up passed the front tires and soaked our sweaty feet             
For now here's some pics we've taken while enjoying our stay with our hosts Bret and Linda Hodgert here in Portland.  Postscripts will come later... Oh yeah, if you happen to know of any employment opportunities in Public Health or Historic Preservation here in the Northwest we'd LOVE to hear about them!           
   Cycling Trips..... Western Australia...mainly South of Perth Mandurah, Pinjara, Dwellingup, Margaret River, Augusta Tasmania ~ 2,000 km (January 1998, Summer) New Zealand (South Island) ~ 2,000 km (January 1999, Summer)   
Overall Impression of Tasmania Beautiful country, very dry and hot in January. I did not have enough time to see the rugged West Coast, I think this would be very special. I would also like to see the Franklin River south west of Hobart, but again not enough time.  Cradle mountain is stunning the and the old museum hut at Cradle Mt were cheap A$10/night I traveled fairly light and camping in caravan parks and National Parks. Hobart on New Years eve was great, the Sydney/Hobart fleet had arrived and the atmosphere was electric . There are plenty of hills (not mountains) and the diversity of the flora and fauna is quite amazing  Expect to find lots of 'road kill', you can smell it well before you see it, Tassie Devils and wombats (The devils get run over while eating road kill) They suggest you throw the road kill to the side of the road only trouble is I would have had to stop every km    Itinery ..

Overall Impression of NZ..... ----------------------------- Beautiful Country, I only cycled the South Island but really loved it. It was fantastic to see mountains with snow....something we never see in Western Australia. There are so many rivers and lakes in NZ, the water is crystal clear and unpolluted...You can drink most of the water without treating it.... Cycling and camping is definitely the way to see the country...take your time and "smell the roses". I'm glad I did it this way, I think that Itinery..... ---------------------- Day 1 & 2 Christchurch Day 3 Lake Lyndon Day 4 & 5 Arthurs Pass    Day 6 Lake Brunner    Day 7 Hokitika/Lake Mahinapua    Day 8 Franz Josef Glacier    Day 9 Lake Mathewsa    Day 10 Haast Pass Day 11 Lake Wanaka/Lake Hawae Day 12  Day 13 to 15 Queenstown      Day 16 Lake Mavora Day 17 Lake Te Anau Day 18 Milford Sound Day 19 Te Anue Day 20 Queentown Day 21 Tarras Day 22 Omatama Day 23 lake Tekapo Day 24 Arundel Day 25 Glenn Tunnel Day 26 & 27 Christchurch

Add 1/2 cup of rolled oats..the cheapest generic brand are the best, You don't have to buy super refined pre cooked, pre digested oats... Bring to the boil and reduce heat...simmer for 2-4 minutes stirring to prevent oats sticking (I hate cleaning burned pots)  Add sugar to taste (2 or 3 spoons) Add powdered milk (3 spoons) Stir and continue simmering for 1-2 minutes (Until oats are not 'gritty') Add a sliced banana. a handful of sultanas...enjoy......


I have another problem with the bike...A major dent in the rear wheel...Thanks Ansett or United Airlines!!!! Rode thru Malibu, very nice the weather is still fairly cold Met my first Randy!!! a RV sales man....Stayed at Oxnard at the State Beach Campground only $1 per night.....absolute bargain!!!!!!!
Cycled with a homeless guy, Kevin...he is the same age as my son Mathew..very sad....there seems to be a lot of people doing it tough in this country.... He was quite positive, very intelligent, just did not want to be part of the rat race I guess... Santa Barbara was very nice. Definately a place I will buy a small house when I win the lottery..... Met my first black guy, very friendly his name was Willy....He was very interested in my trip and the gear I was carrying.... Got to El Capitan SB campground fairly late, I thought I was going to run out of daylight..... Had a few beer with some fellow cyclists....talked a lot about politics... Boy....do the Americans love their politics and give their politicians heaps..... I love it...... Americans have opinions on everything!!!!!!
Got into Lompoc early they had a spring festival.....live music, plenty of food....what else can you ask for... I sampled some chilli at one of the stalls and I'm still suffering!!!! The camping ground was very basic and completely void of atmosphere...... I had my first Bud today.... well it was really two 24 oz cans!!!!! What a great idea....I just have to find a stubby holder to fit it!!! I slept quite well that night.............. Finally got a new fuel stove..only cost 14 cents to fill my bottle with auto gas...A real bargin at last!!!!!! The only problem with the stove is that you would not want to light it up inside the tent, you can see the flames when it first starts from about 50 yards away.....
A good ride and some good climbs with some wicked downhills, several switch backs but the climbing was OK. The bike is quite well balanced even though it looks overweight and a little "ugly" I am sorting out the weight distribution better each day I ride. I am carrying a lot of wet weather gear, I don't want to get caught somewhere a spend the night cold and wet. The ride thru Santa Maria to Pismo Beach was very pleasant.... The wind came in in the afternoon quite strong..... The campground at Pismo Beach is very nice, in fact this is a very pleasant town. I will spend tomorrow looking around and talking to people about some good places to visit. I bought a California State Parks Map, excellent vaule at $3, I paid a fortune for American maps back in Oz... I should have saved my money....
Check out the Clam Chowder while in town it is magnificent...served in sour dough bread....yummy!!!!! Watching the guys surf at the pier is really great....this area looks like it could get some really big swells in the winter..... The Library in town is great, free Internet access and really friendly staff...


Several big switch backs and climbs of 1000 feet...quite nice... I paid $3.20/gallon for fuel for my stove, what a rip off (even though it only takes 25 cents to fill the canister).... Boy I bet the travelers in their RVs will really be feeling it this summer......
Walked down to the beach at Plaskett Creek and saw what I thought looked like a wild dog...It was not a fox....It looked a lot like a dingo (A dingo stole my baby!!!! - sick Aussie joke) Stopped at Julia Pfeiffer Burns SB, any relation to Michelle???? Really nice.... pretty place..... Well I hit the wall today...the climbs took a lot out of me, along with the heat..... Well its Saturday Nite....Mike and I decided that we deserved a few beers... A six pack of Corona, boy them Mexicans know how to make Beer and Chilli and a six pack of Moosehead... (ditto the Canadians....) Camping tonight in the Red Woods...fantastic...what magestic trees....I am really looking forward to seeing some really big ones further North...... A rest day tomorrow...which is good because I only have enough energy to stagger to my tent and collapse...... There is a big Jazz festival in the park tomorrow... That should be nice.. Pleasant dreamzzzzzzzzzz.........................
Well the park is really crowded today there is a Jazz Festival on it good value...$35 the only thing is I'm not a huge fan of Jazz.....Now if it had been a Rock of Blues festival that would be a different story...... I went for a hike up one of the hills/mountains Buzzard Roaster Ridge....A fairly steep climb......proberbly about 6 or 7 km all together..... A fairly nice day lots of people enjoying themselves and me relaxing amongst the giant Redwoods......very relaxing....
Unlimited hot water showers.......Heaven.........!!!!!!!! Had a nice ride around the Monteray Penincular, very pretty the ground covers were in full bloom, red carpets of flower everywhere..... There were seal , sea otters and pelicans everywhere.... I missed seeing the aquarium....well if you have seen one caged shark you have seen them all. Tin Can road is also very interesting.....an old remnant from the days when this place had a large number of fish canneries.... Back up the hill by eight....a little too much sun today.... A Beer complements of the last campers......
Went thru Castroville....and then on to Sunset Beach... The camp site is very nice here, although the bike and hike area is not very well maintained.....then where a lot of weeds and wild oats...I pitched my tent on the other side of the road..... We had a great file.....pine cones really burn well (It said no wood gathering but it did not mention pine cones!!!!) A nice tea.....wild rice, butter fried mushrooms, zuchini, red peppers - God I'm fantastic....cooking all this in just two pots!!!!

Anyhow.......walked on the beach....very relaxing.....tomorrow Santa Cruz
Booked into the New Brighton Campground.....quite nice, again the area was a little over grown..... some work is needed guys..... Met my first Rainbow Child, his name was Flying or Running Skunk! He was a nice guy he had a dog with 3 legs, one eye, half an ear missing and a large scar on his face, its name was lucky ----- boy some Americans are a little strange.... Went to the AAA, got some really great maps which I can use for the rest of my trip in california...They were very helpful A nice tea ---- followed by a Mud Slide (Kalaha, Vodco, Baileys and cream --- you would like this Pete, get some for the next TKD dinner......)

Over Pacheco Pass (1368 feet), it was a killer temperature was 90+ This side of the mountains is really dead and dry......wicked down hill (81k) into San Luis Reservoir........ The lady Ranger took a shine to me, she was impressed with my good looks obviously!   Anyway I didn't have to pay $14/night...... Really windy and barren....I would not recommend staying here......
Arrived really late 7:30pm, almost dark....could not find a camp spot so I pitched my tent in a "hide-a-way" place..... Will get up early and be off by 6am....will follow the road North to Coarsegold and then into the National Forest..... Really stuffed today......I'll sleep well........

Swam, washed.....boy the water was cold, sorry jewels!!! Had a couple of 24oz cans of Bud........hit the sack by 9:30pm......
Went for a ride around the lake.....big mistake.......after 40km finally got back to my camp...... Relaxed, snoozed, read, wrote some letters........ Stayed till about 5pm then decided to find a place to stay tonight.... Decided to tackle the first part of the climb into the Yosemite National Park...... Rode to the Forks then on to Sugar Pine.... A steep climb, passed the 3,000ft elevation......Camped on the side of the road behind a turnout.... A few mozzies.....but OK................
Wicked downhill into Wawona...then to the Giant Sequoia Groves......WOW!!!!! These trees are fantastic.......the biggest living things on the planet.... and old 3,000 years old........ Found a nice camping spot behind the golf course..... I did the Daniel Boon thing and hung all my food in a food bag in a tree.... I was quite proud of myself.... I was a little paranoid during the night....thinking about the bears.... There is a really interesting Old West Village set up here where school kids stay overnight and live the "Old West", a really great idea....learning history really hands on..... The parents take on roles and join in as well.....really fantastic.....
Bridalveil Falls, El Capitain, Cathedral Rocks.......Magnificent!!!!! Watched climbers scaling the face of El Capitain......

A really nice couple frank and his lady gave me some turkey and energy bars so I went for the pass.... Tioga Pass (10,000ft elevation) the highest auto pass in california........ The down hill was scary......I mean scary.....sheer cliff faces and drops as you decend....... 10 km at 8% grade plus 3km at 4%.......Thanks Kym for setting the bike up for me I had complete confidence in it (well that is what I told myself) Mono Lake....well the name says it all........

Really hilly and guess what DL Bliss Camp Site is still closed..... I met Ranger Martha, really nice person (a cyclist herself) I stayed here anyway.... Boy it was quite.....swam in the lake it was not too bad!!! No where as cold as the water on the East side? I will ride to Sugar Pine Point tomorrow and stay there.... I really prefer the West side of the lake .....the roads are a lot narrower...but I think it is a lot more pretty.... I don't know about the bike trails, I really think that they were an after thought to shut the cyclist up...... The don't take in much of the lake although they do go through some nice forest areas...... Oh well....tomorrow I will have an opotunity to explore some more......
Cycled to Sugar Pine.....left my gear and then decided to explore the Northern Shore of the lake...... Rode to tahoe City.... an interesting place plenty of exibits and Museums etc with a lot of history of the lake and the Indians who lived here.... Big mistake......fast food for the first time Maccas Cheeseburgers for 39 cents.... I could not resist.... Well I spent the next hour in the restroom... I felt really crook....... I had to cut my tour short.......then to make matters worse, I felt better and had a real craving for Chocolate Fudge Icecream.... I ate a pint of the stuff, boy did I feel really crook..... Crawled into my sleeping bad about 9pm feeling very sorry for myself......... Oh well the things we do to ourselves....... Tomorrow I will start the trip to San Fransisco..... I will take the easy route down HW 89 there should be some intesting things to see along the way..... I'll check out the maps.... Anyway I proberbly will make no communications until then.... Hopefully I will be staying on Angel Island, which is in the middle of the bay ( I think?) For those of you who might have visited Lake Toba in Samartra, Lake Tahoe sort of reminds me a little of it, minus the cars, people and houses of course.... See you all in San Fransisco......
The cycleway took me mostly to Donner lake, had a nice swim and spoke to an old guy who was catching fish (a limit of 5 trout/day......$29 for a licence) Then the Donner Pass (7,239 ft) not a bad climb, quite steep...... Ended up in a deserted Sate Campground (A thousand Trails???) The campground is right next to a stream.....quite a nice place..... The HW 80 is quite nearby and very noise........
HW 20 nice ride to Nevarda City.....got completely lost ( I don't have too much luck with freeways and big cities!!!!!) Finally got on to HW 49 and off to Auburn.......again got lost, but ended up meeting a really loverly lady Sue, An interior designer, I think (What a beautiful home she had....it was just in the final stages of being completed.....) Folsom lake....not very nice....dry and no where to camp......ended up finding a cycleway which took me to Folsom Bridge...where there was a group camping area... Well I met the American Tribe of the Fuckarewee.....in particular Penny and Brett....very nice tribe members they belonged to the family Bell (something to do with a telephone company I think) Anyway I was initiated into the tribe.....wading in the freezing cold water with a torch in one hand and a can of beer in the other......catching maron (well thats what we call them in Western Australia) I told them the legal size was a beer can length and they laughed at me....OH well, anyway I caught the first one so I am now a lifelong member.....

Very pleasant......by the river.....ducks and birds......
HW 121 was busy, windy and really scary...plus I had a screaming head wind most of the way.....boy I thought the drivers would be better on a Sunday!!!!! I made a big mistake.....I should have stopped at China Camp State Park..but no David said he can make it to Tiberon and catch the ferry to Angle Island... Well 8pm, the last ferry left at 5pm.....I had to pitch camp somewhere.... It looks like the bush again... I was really tired.....Did I mention that I hate Freeways.....
Well I decided not to stay at angel island (I'm afraid that I might get struck down in the middle of the night by a thunder bolt.....not really although it did cross my mind.....the ferry schedule is too restrictive and I will be stuck on the island......) Anyway to China Camp State Park....heaven....A hot shower for the first time in a week..... i did some washing, my cloths are starting to get a little grotty..... A very nice camp site..the only problem was that I already had my tent pitched before I was told that the hike and bike area was 100m away.....Oh well I really wanted to pack up and set everything up again..... An exciting day tomorrow.....site seeing in San Francisco.....
Well, did i tell you that I don't like freeways???? A difficult ride to San Rafael, Larkspur, passed Tiboron and to Sausalito.. What a great place...really quaint.... Then WoW, the Golden Gate Bridge, except that they have painted it a kakky red/orange.... You know I know this guy who once painted Sydney Harbour Bridge...Paul something???/ It only took me 3 hours to cover the 50km, but the ride was worth it... Spent the day in the bay area.....the Presidio, Fort Mason, Fisherman's Wharf Pier 39....very exciting plenty of people.... Had yummy fish and chips, except that they were served with Chilli sauce.... I'm sorry but, fish and chips must be served with vinegar, chicken salt and pepper..... It was a great day.... caught the ferry back to Larkspur...a really nice trip... Tomorrow I start up the coast again following HW 1 ....... I am looking forward to some cooler weather....
On my way out of the Park in the morning I met a girl by the name of Sarah, she organizes special trail bike riding for disadvantaged and abused kids.... I did my Crocodile Dundee impersonation and gave them a talk about what I was doing in the US..... Rode along Sir Fransis Darake Drive to Samuel Taylor..... Met a disabled cyclist in the park, very nice lady..... Very hot and humid today ----- 90+
Lots of ups and downs......, quite hot.... Met a pommy guy Mike from Manchester.... Finished early glad to have some company.... Two Canadians arrived later in the day (Hoss and Scott), Hoss was mad as a meat axe.... nice guy Decided to have a meeting of the Commonwealth and solve some of the problems in the Commonwealth..... It was quite a productive meeting, (if you count the number of beer cans) Decide that Andrew would be perfect for the next Queen...... Bed really late.....ZZZZZZZZ
Really foggy today, poor visability......pleasant ride along HW1...not much traffic A couple of good climbs, especially just out of Jenner, decided to stay at Gualala, nice camping spot....Bike & Hike $3... Met a really nice guy Peter, 27yo, has done a number of things including working for Green Peace.... We had some very philysophical (sp) discussions about, life, the universe, ect... WOW what a treat... I met a guy who gave me a Red Abolone.....7 inch min size... What a monster.... I had to clean and bash it to tenderize it..... I cooked it in garlic, chilli and olive oil.....orgasmic ... well the closest thing that I have had lately.... ( I ate about 1/2 kg, Peter was a vegetanian!!!!)
This was one of the hardest days so far.... 20-30km head winds very gusty.... I had a lot of problems controlling the bike..... The climbs and switch backs were good because there was some relief.... Met a young girl walking on the road, talked to her for about 1/2 hour.... I think this helped me to complete the day.... Completely stuffed...... Very cold and windy...I slept well
Decided to have a nice and easy day..... did lots of reading and writing... A nice campground....interesting display of lichens!!!! Walked around Cleone Lake very nice....relaxing......
Pleasant ride thru Bell Point and Westport...... Its great to be riding away from the coast.....thru Hales grove and into Leggett.. Plenty of wild flowers, then joined HW 101 into HUMBOLDT County, this joined HW 271 which runs parallel, but have very little traffic.... Well HUMBOLT is supposed to be the POT capital of the USA!!!! People here look like they have been in a time warp since the 70's.....I think there are more Combie Vans registered here than any where else in the States!!!! Stopped at Standish Hickey SP and watched guys with chainsaws caving huge sculptures from redwood... Visited a redwood Tree House......4,000 yo 30 feet in diameter.... A great day....hot shower....to a 76 to buy a beer or two, or three!!!!
A "spin out" guy, in a Combie!!! looked about 60yo asked me "Do people in Australia use LSD?"...... Now this I felt was a fairly general question, and I did'nt want to give him the wrong impression, I think he was considering migrating or something... So I thought about it....remembering that "Dave Smith's" - social circle is fairly diverse, so I said No!!!  He was quite disappointed....went off mumbling something about Pink Elephants...... met a really nice Guy, Sascha (same name as my Nat) 27 yo been travelling for 9 months....satrted in Marocco then to Egypt to US (NY to San Fransisco across the desert, including Death Valley) What a nice guy really laid back...easy to talk to... We cycled the valley of the Giants HW 271 and camped amongst the redwoods....really excellent.... I had the worst tea ......rice, semalina, carrot with a revolting satay mix....lucky we bought some Red Dog Beer to wash the taste away.... A nice day.....a really good night sleep......ZZZZZZZZZZZZZ
The Redwood Forests have a special magic which is impossible to explain.... They are cool, the light is filtered and it is quite errie..... I decided to go off the beaten track..... The Lost Coast........Cycled thru Humbolt Redwood Forest, WOW absolutely beautiful.....long winding roads.....filtered light, huge trees everywhere.... A nice climb Panther Gap (el 2744ft), then a great ride along Mattole Road to the sleep town of Honeydew, now I am not kidding but three VWs rolled up to the grocery store while I was there!!!!! Then on to Mattole Point.....to camp for the night... WOW what a great isolated area....wind swept beach, millions of pieces of drift wood...from small peices to huge trees, all sun bleached.... I collected heaps and made my self a wind chime that now hangs from on of the rear panniers, right next to my Aussie Flag!!!!! Met another really nice guy.....we talked by the campfire.....a really nice day.. PS I stripped completely naked (what a horrible site, scared all the squirrels) and swam in the river mouth!!!!!!! To bed, read my book and listen to the waves ponding on the beach.....
Boy there were some steep climbs comming from the coast.....but my time is up, I'll tell you about it later.... Well the climbs out of here were quite challenging, I think some were 20 degrees.. Up and down very pretty, into Ferdale, quite a nice town, then on to Eueka ( I wish I had'nt found it!!!) Checked out Little River and Clam Beach (yuk!!) then on to Patrick Point SB..... Met Heidi on the road, She is a "freind" of Sascha, she flagged me down and we decided to share the cost of a camp site for the night... Had a haircut and heidi gave my neck a much needed massage....heaven...
Up really late and took off late 12pm!!!!!! Nice ride thru, Orick (Alas poor Orick, I knew him well....sorry Bob) Then what a great ride thru Newton B Drury Parkway .... Huge redwoods no traffic ..... To the coast at Klamath some climbing, but OK.... boy have I got a climb tomorrow just getting out of the park (4 km uphill!!!) I have decided to do the coast route in Oregon....will check out Cresent City tomorrow and get some maps etc.....
Well after last night in the rain, I decided that I better waterproof my fly, I did'nt get wet but there was a lot of condensation inside.... I have'nt seen a grocery store for three days and then I say my favorite SAFEWAY!!! I bought $20 worth, two big plastic bags full!!!!! Where am I going to put it all, I had plastic bags handing everywhere!!!! Checked out the Redwoods Tourist Info Centre, excellent, soem great maps of the Oregon Coast, including a mile-by-mile blow of all the attractions along they way... Camp site at Harris Beach was very nice, but $4/night!!!!! All the showers are free, so I used about $20 in hot water, (well its the only simple pleasure that I have to look forward to) The coast here is really spectacular....lots of granite outcrops, black sand beaches, the trouble is the water is too darn cold (40-50 degrees) that is b....dy cold!!!!!! I discovered a homeless guy sleeping in the Hike and Bike area....I packed all my stuff up before I went to bed.... A good nights sleep...I really am enjoying my book...I wish I had enjoyed it as much when I had to read it when I was 15 years old....
Well its only $1/night in California, I object to paying $4/night....!!! The weather is quite cool, in fact it is really cold...and there is a strong wind... Rain again last night... I passed over the Pistol River today, the tallest bridge in Oregon is accross this river 345 feet... They are paining it at the moment 2.4 Million Dollars!!!! I spoke to a couple of the guys working on the bridge, I told them that Paul Hogan painted the Sydney habour Bridge before he became famous..... I mean 2.4 M all you need is to get a few guys over, a couple of cartons and you could get it knocked over in a weekend..... Anyway, you know what they should have pained it before they put it up.... I have learned that the hard way....... Well I am staying at Humbug Mountain tonight, a very nice H&B area, nobody else here..... very quite on the roads......very nice.....
My watch has stopped so I have no idea of the time..... The campground is very nice......a little quiet.....but nice.....plenty of wild flowers and birds..... One of those darn bluebirds....crapped all over my bike cover and then decided to start pecking holes in the cover!!!!! The winds are really good...20 ks from the south so I have had a very cruzy ride... I tried at three libraries to get on to the Internet....the first did'nt open till 1pm (this was at 11am), the second in Langlois was not open mondays....so eventually I found a very nice library with some really nice librarians in Bandon..... I am going to finsh my ride at Sunset Bay just south of Coos Bay today about 20km to go.... I have enough food to feed me and all the people in the campgrounds!!!!! The ride to Sunset Beach is not that pretty, there are a lot of areas where they have clear felled the land, they don't even use a buffer zone here, just strip the forest right back to the road....Quite disappoining. The winds are still from the South, touch wood (I'm in Oregon.......) Will update this page when I reach Newprt or Lincoln City......
There are some really intesting bridges here in Oregon, I have taken pictures of quite a few of them...The are both architecturally and artistically Well I just got the nod from the librarian...its 4pm time to close up... Back again....Well my rear tyre finally gave out on me.... down to the canvas in 2 or 3 places..... plus I am sick of fixing flats...... The chain need some attention, either it needs replacing or just a good clean....maybe I'll give the whole bike a real treat in Portland.....
Fee showers.....a safe place to camp and you do'nt have to pay the $5/night fee!!!!! Breakfast at the lake, really nice, I thought today would be a really cruzy day....no..... Into Florence, a really quaint town right on the beach plenty of old shops selling all sorts of junk...luck I can't carry any of it.... Now get this.....do not listen to Hippies.......especially if they are 18 years old...... He said...."You want to stay at a really nice camping spot, on the river with a great little water fall......plenty of fire wood....." Well down a river road up and down hills into a sreaming head wind....5 miles on..... Mud.....mozzies...overgrown......yuk....... Anyway back to town and finally into Beach Side Campground...... A couple of cyclist there...an older guy and a really nice Texan guy who is even more crazy than me, his name is John.... Taxas to Vancouver....he started his trip in early April..... We have decided to ride together untill we get to Portland.... I would like to be there for my Birthday!!!! Maybe go out to tea and have a few beers...so whats new.....
Gorilla Camping again....this time I beat the ranger by 5 minutes..... The ride was good though because the wind is from the South..... Through Newport and into Linclon City spent some time at the beach..... John is 25 years old and a socialogy major, (but I will not hold this against him!!!!!) The campground at Devil's Lake is quite nice....but the showers only know one temperature......bloody hot....I think every part on by body was bright pink!!!!! A couple of beers today.....up early tomorrow.....you know why.....
Example.....Camputer says....14:21, subtract 9 is 15:21 (subtract 12) 3:21pm!!! Well try doing that at 5am, after you have had a couple of Red Dogs!!!! The ride today was really nice, old HW101 to Neskown, nice and hilly thru the town of Ocean side to Tillamouk and finally into Bay City..... The public park is a little too public and no showers....but I can't complain because I will not be paying anyhow!!!!! Nice tea of mushrooms, capsicum and pasta....fixed two punctures.....Tomorrow Fort Stevens and into Astoria.....Will proberbly cross the boarder into Washington...just for the hell of it....
Did a nice little 16 mile side trip, loop Garibaldi to Mohler, very quiet plenty of farmland and the loverly smell of cow dung!!!!! Back onto HW101 thru Cannon Beach, Seaside, boy was that town really packed with tourists!!!! The library there was very nice and the librarian extememly nice... Finally into Fort Steven SP, Wow what a size.... 600+ sites....computer printouts......excellent......you can always blame a computer when your name does not appear on the printout..... "Yes Mr Ranger, I paid at the checkin....I do not know why my name is not on the list!!!!!" Met a heap of other cyclist all travelling South......Joe from New York, he was heading to santa Cruz, a married couple on their first tandom cycling trip..... Now I have to tell you....there are several ways to see if a relationship/marriage is really going to pass the acid test.... Method One......Go Camping!!!!!!! Method Two......Go on a cycling holiday!!!!!! I think they have already filed for divorce (only kidding!!!!!) I played the guitar for the first time in 2 months!!!!! This guy had a travel guitar...really wicked...... A full size guitar....but with a small sound box... I am going to look for one...I might treat myselfor my birthday
Astoria has been used as a set for a number of movies....The Goonies, another I do not know the name, but it had a robot running arround the country side saying "Number 5 is alive!!!!" and several others...... Astoria is a really neat town......went to the Astoria Tower....an old lighthouse at the top of town...boy that was a nice grade (20-25 degrees) Cycled the bridge to Washington State....6 km (4 miles!!!!) long... There was a screaming headwind there, but boy the ride back was excellent.... Now John is a Texan, he does not have a big hat but boy he can really put the food away!!!!!!

Had a wonderful sleep in the forest so peaceful......ZZZZZZzzzzzzzzzz....
Its interesting to see how family dynamics work.....especialy when you are removed from it.... Families are the same the whole world over!!!!!! However we still could not get away from them they decided to do the same trip...so we was them at all the view points along the way...I thought it was great!!!! Then we were off over the Bridge of the Gods.....Stevenson to carson and along Wind River for about 13 miles (now I am doing it, 20 Km) We camped by the river, really nice, although it was hard work pussing the bikes over the rocks in the river.... Met an angler, he had just caught a 14 lb salmon!!!! It was huge.... Anyway quite tired today....over 4,000 ft of climbing....... A good night sleep, I hope.......
Well it pissed down today.....Very unpleasant wet cold, muddy...cycling with wet shoes and cold wet underdacks!!!! - YUKKY!!!!!! I suffered from hyperthermia....It was lucky that there was a campground at Eagles Cliff.... two huge mugs of hot chocolate ..... plus the rest of my rather say looking bagels!!!!! We battled on along HW25, both feeling rather dejected...finally we found a siding where there was a gravel pit and some forest..... Pitched our tents in the pouring rain...boy tonight is going to be fun.... Guess what....you can get a fire alight with plastic bread bags....what a difference it makes to be able to semi-dry your cloths... Now I sness of smoke and soot not BO, (I think this will change because I will not be able to shower for the next 2 or 3 days!!!!) As Sascha says.....We are cyclist...It does not matter... In his rich German voice and dialect!!!!! Had a really bad stomach ache...I think the beaver must have contaminated some of my food...boy I suffered during the night...... Well into my cold damp sleeping bag...goodnight sweet world....tomorrow will be a better day.....
Up at 7am....No rain...you beauty!!!!!! But its freezing.....5 degrees celsius..Sasch has a cycle computer with the lot!!!!! including an altimeter ( A thing for measuring height Pete!!!!!) All my gear is soaked...but I dont care.....It was so cold I thought that I had lost my fingers and toes....I put a pair of socks on my hands, dont laugh it works!!! (You have a little trouble changing gear on the bike!!!!) We headed for Windy Ridge....WOW what a great ride, plenty of elevation gain....but really woth it.... The blast zone from Mt St Helens is increadible.... May 18, 1980 I still can remember it.... Huge forests completely flatened, trees 2 and 3 feet in diameter brocken off like match sticks.....all lying in perfect rows away from the blast zone.... It is hard to imagine, over 1000 ft of montain blown away, temperature of the blast 500 degrees and 300 miles an hour......Millions of animals and plants killed instantly......Pray to God this type of event will never occur again..especially if it is mane made....... Spirit Lake is beautiful....a huge part of the lake is completely covered by fallen trees..... the lake rose 200-300 feet because of the blast..... I cannot describe it, the whole thing is fantastic.....what a wonderful experience... We camped the night at Beaver, a piknic spot...really lovely with a fabulous view of the montain.... What a fantastic day.... The only down side is that both Sascha and myself have run out of food......Oh well we will have to chew on bike parts till we get to Randle.... Bet by 10pm...I finished my book...it did not end very well, dont you just hate that.......
A spectacular ride along HW25 to Randle (40km) all down hill a drop in elevation 3,800 feet to 800 feet..... I said my final (well I dont believe in final!) goodbye to heidi and Sascha...what a great guy....he gave me a hug just like my Mathew does.... 6'3" of big pussy cat.....I really bonded well with him I really hope we can catch up with each other again someday......Anyway he is a German mechanic....He can fix my 63 VW Beetle when he comes to Oz!!!!! I found a great camping spot along the river....plenty of fresh water and the sound of running water to help me sleep (and pee)... I have started to "do a Sascha" I have finally found a very useful purpose for my spare water bottle at night!!!!! Boy it beats going out in the rain....Pete if you borrow a water bottle from me don't use the yellow one!!!!! Tomorrow Mt Rainier....I hope the name (Rain) does not jinx me....
I am convinced that there is no such mountain as Mt Rainier...well I could not find it!!!! Thru Ohanopecosh, the Ranger at the info Centre was great but he could not change the fact that there would be bad weather for the next couple of days.... I ate lunch in a restroom at the campsite.... I organised a wilderness pass to stay overnight on the montain at Deer Creek.....the elevation was 3,500 feet...but because of the lousy weather I decided to go over the pass at Cayuse (4694 feet) and camp at a lower elevation..... I was cold wet and feeling a little down, plus I was worried that I might get hyperthermia...... There was a lot of snow on the pass...the down hill was too cold to enjoy.....but the weather at least improved and the rain eased to a miserable drizzle.....    Hot chocolate....stove inside the tent to warm everthing up....into my sleeping bag by 8:00pm to get warm...... Did not see Mt "Raining" but Beth sent me a picture for you to look at...It is a spectacular mountain...it has about 10 glaciers and is a popular mountain to climb.... 
Into Greenwater and Snumclaw (I'm not sure of the pronunciation) along HW410 I had to stop at a camping store to try and repair one of my tent poles which is slightly damaged....A little honey in the sports section served me and we talked for 20-30 minutes.... The HW164 to Auburn was OK, the sholder was a little narrow but the cars and trucks were fine..... I got directions from two different gas station guys...... How do I get to HW99 which parallels HW5 which I cannot ride on!!!! Finally arrived at Saltwater SP, a nice beach and a great picnic area..... Showered (first time in 5 days) had a shave, scoped out an area to pitch my tent...and then guess what..... Six Swiss cyclist, 2 tandom bike (which had got lost in transit) !!!!! Two guys and four girls....I tell ya I did this trip all wrong!!!!! One of the girls was really nice....and she was blind...they were going to do the Vancouver to San Diego...they were going to rent/buy a car and share the riding...what a great idea.....some one carries all the luggage and makes sure that tea is cooked whn you arrive at the end of the day.... I camped on their site for the night.......
They wanted to change me a seperate $13 because there are not supposed to be more than 2 tents per site...... I politely gave then my name and rode out of the park..... Easy ride along First Av into Seattle....the traffic got quite busy...there are some freeway problems....apparently there was an earth quake last month which damaged one of the major ones in Downtown Seattle....it has to be demolished.... I booked into the Green Tortoise Hostel $18/night..... very nice free breakfast...coffee...videos...and guess what Friday night is free Beer (18 gallon keg...It reminded me of my old rugby days back at Uni.....) I met three pommy guys...... Ben (researcher for broadcast), Anthony ex student History major and Dave.... (easy to remember!!!!) Well we went on a pub crawl and got "pissed as parrots"..... $7 for a huge pitcher of beer..... half a gallon I think..... I cannot remember much of the night, but I think we had a good time   
 
Stayed up and watched Pulp Fiction......I wonder about myself sometimes!!!! Well 3 hours sleep!!!!! went for a walk to wake up.... No shops open at 7am...MMMMMM I wonder why..... Excellent breakfast.....fried, greasy eggs, muffins, toast, banana ( I know how to spell bananananana, I just dont know when to stop!!!! ....sorry Bob) Went to the "Underground Tour" excellent the history of Seattle is really fantastic.... How not to build a city.... mud flats, krappers, sewerage, royal flushes, sewing machines.....red light district.... I'll write some details about it later.... Met Beth later in the afternoon, what a great lady.....we went on a really great habour tour..through locks, under bridges, from fresh to sea water....Hey I just realized how dangerous that could be..... fresh water is not as bouyant as sea water.... I wonder if the captain knew that????? Well a great tea at Beth's house....... New York steaks!!!!! Beth was great.....if you want to bye a house in Seattle give her a "tinkle" click to show email  Her son Steven is a very nice "lad" computer scientist, watch out Bill there are a lot of young people out there with you in their sights!!!!!! Back to the Hostel by 11.30pm.....could not help myself....watched the movie "American Beauty" what a great movie.....
They invited me to stay at their house, which is great, I will be able to wash and dry my sleeping bag..... 2 months without a wash....now I know why I have been travelling alone!!!!! At the moment Seattle has a number of pigs arund the downtown area, no I'm not talking about drunk Aussie and Pommy blokes on pub crawls.... The "Pigs on Parrade" is just great, fibreglass pigs which have been decorated by a variety of artists...... an excellent charity drive, they will be auctioned later... Now Terry fancies himself as a "Hell's Angel" but this is the best he could come up with......    I saw this pig, it was great untill I realised that the flag of Australia was on its but!!!!! Something to do with "Down-under" I expect!!!!!    Well I now have the secret for perfect pancakes..... I had to break Terry's leg to get it, thus the hiking stick in the photo!!!!!    Well I have had a ball in Seattle....but now back to the real world....I have my AAA maps of Washington and British Columbia.....I have a pretty good idea of how to get there.... head North!!!!!! I think I will catch the ferry to Anacartes and stay at Deception Pass State Beach tonight...then head off to the San Juan Islands...... Thanks Beth, Terry, Vicky for making my stay in Seattle absolutely fantastic.... I will remember it for a long time to come..... If anyone would like to send a message to the three poms...... click to show email  they would like it I'm sure.......
I put 4 rolls of film into CostCo for processing, they also put the images onto disk, so hopefully I should have some pictures on the pages soon....... Caught the ferry from Mukiltoe to Langley Island...then had a pleasant ride the full length of the island to Deception Pass SP.... There is a bridge across to Andarcates , where I will catch the ferry tomorrow to the San Juan Islands... The campground at Deception Pass is really nice....very pretty with access to beaches on the West and East side of the island.....I found a really nice campspot in the Bike & Hike area....
I landed on Lopez island, but only had an hour before the next ferry arrived for Orcas Island....
Boy were they doing it in style..... the tour organizer Bad...what a top guy... They invited me to lunch with them at American Camp on San Juan island....there is also an English Camp..there was a war here over the killing of a pig!!!! (No not a drunk Aussie on a pub crawl!!!!!!) Well waht a lunch...I was the first one there and I go started early....Chicken Salad, Smokes Salmon...the best food I have eaten in a month....I was so full I had trouble cycling back.....the problem also was that I had 3 bags full of all the left-overs!!!! Now I was not being a complete pig.....they were heading for Canada, and could not take all of the fruit, ect on the ferry....... Cycled to Lime Kiln SP and then on to the County Campground to stay overnight... What a great campground......beautiful, overlooking the ocean to the West...I just say there all afternoon, looking across the bay to the coast of Vancouver... The actual bay is called Small Pox Bay...great name hey!!!!! Well bagels, avacado and cheese for tea.....

A  nice bath......clean cloths......a comfortable bed (In the back of her Combie on the front lawn!!!!) ------ Excellent....Tomorrow I will start my canadian Adventure.......

I got on the train at 2:38 am in Elyria, and arrived at the Buffalo station at about 7:15.  Arriving in Buffalo, I thought the train would never stop at the station.  But it did, and it took me about 15 minutes then to set up my rig.  I was eating breakfast at Alton's on Walden Street in Buffalo by 7:45. I arrived at Best Western Hotel on Delaware Street at 9:00, tired from lack of sleep.  I asked the clerk what time I could check in, and she said 2:00.  Then I asked if I could leave a piece of luggage at the hotel, since I had a reservation and was going to check in later.  So she changed her mind and let me check in immediately.  I took advantage of that by sleeping for three hours. Next I went out to ride across the Peace Bridge.  Originally, I had planned to ride up to Niagara Falls on Sunday.  But I changed my mind; it was just too rainy and cold.  So I just went for a tour of the Niagara River.  As I was riding up Porter Avenue toward the bridge, I noticed a big parade up ahead.  "Wow" I thought, "they didn't have to have a parade just because I came to town!"  But as I got closer, I saw a banner in the parade that read "Gay Pride Day".  I guess the parade wasn't being held in my honor after all. All in all, I had a very nice ride along the Niagara River in Canada.  Afterward, I took a shower and went in search of food.  I had an absolutely delicious meal of Broccoli Pasta at the TOWNE Restaurant. Total mileage today:  27.0      Show links to this Hide links to this     
In Dunkirk, I stopped at Marshall's Waterfront Cafe for a cup of coffee.  The moment I walked in, Marshall, the owner, introduced himself and asked where I had ridden in from.  I told him I just rode from Buffalo, and that I was headed for Elyria, Ohio.  Marshall was quite impressed, and even called the local paper to do a "story" about me.  They apparently weren't as impressed as he was, because they didn't come.  Marshall's grandfather is famous.  At the age of 110, he made the Guiness Book of World Records for being the world's oldest licensed driver. The ride was quite hilly today, with a pretty strong headwind too.  But still, I arrived and got settled into camp at Lake Erie State Park by 4:00.  Shortly thereafter, I went into town for dinner, but there were no restaurants anywhere nearby.  The owner of the local general store heated up some rice for me in her microwave.  I was so impressed by her kindness, I promised to send her a hat for her huge hat collection. The rest of the evening was spent playing Upwords and watching the sunset on the lake with two new friends, a couple of vagabonds from North Carolina. Total mileage today:  65.9   
Just before I got to the Pennsylvania border, there was a sign stating Route 5 was closed ahead, so I continued on to Erie on Route 20.  I crossed the Pennsylvania border at 9:40 am.  At about 10:30, I stopped in the charming little town of North East, Pennsylvania for a "library break".  Libraries are my favorite place to find clean, public restrooms.  I'm glad I got off Route 5 for a while.  It's pretty, riding along the lakeshore, but there are few places to stop for a break or buy food.   Both Routes 5 and 20 in New York and Pennsylvania are good biking roads.  They both have huge paved clean shoulders, and little traffic.  There is more commerce on Route 20 and more beautiful scenery on Route 5, and the two routes run parallel within a mile or less of each other, so I often alternated between the two routes. Route 5 has five names:  Route 5, Bike Route Z, Seaway Trail, Lake Erie Circle Route, and Purple Heart Highway.  All the names are never posted at the same time, once I saw four of the names co-located so I took a picture of all the signs.  I wonder why they have so many names for one road. Somewhere along route 20, I stopped at a roadside stand and bought some fresh strawberries.  They were so juicy and delicious.  I ate half of them after my camp was set up, and attempted to save the other half for Wednesday?s breakfast. My campsite Tuesday night was right on the beach in Sara Coyne Campground on the Presque Isle Peninsula in Erie.  It was a really cool campsite.  The sunset on Lake Erie is just beautiful.  Both at Presque Isle and Lake Erie State Park, I enjoyed awesome sunsets.  I wondered to myself if the sunset at home in Lorain was as nice. Total mileage today:  58.7   
Before leaving Erie, I had breakfast at McDonald's.  Most mornings I would ride for about an hour first, but this morning, I was so hungry.  An hour later, I stopped enroute for a break and ate the rest of those wonderful strawberries. At some point during this past week, I started referring to my bike and trailer set up as a "rig".  Well, with the trailer attached, I'm not just riding a bike; I am driving a rig, right? There are a lot more hills on this route than I thought there would be, which leaves me wishing I had done more hill training with my rig.  The hills are difficult with a rig, and I make it up some of them at a snail's pace.  And, once I looked at my computer, and my speed was 3.1 mph.  I was surprised the bike was still upright at that rate.  Still, I think pedaling up at a snail's pace is easier than pushing the rig up the hill on foot!  So, I just keep spinning. I entered Ohio at 10:16 am, hoping to see a restroom soon.  After taking care of that in Conneaut, of course I had to ride down to the dock to see if any ships were in port.  The FRONTENAC was being loaded with coal.   Next stop, a nice little roadside park near Ashtabula for a snack and a break.  The lake was very hazy that day, but I could see the Ashtabula breakwall out to the west, and in the distance I could see a freighter that appeared to be at anchor, because it wasn't moving for quite a while. I had lunch at Doxies Deli by the coal dock in Ashtabula.  The DAVID Z NORTON was at the coal dock at the time, loading coal.  A watchman from the ship stopped me and asked if I knew where there was a bike shop.  I told him it was on Route 20, and we talked for a while about my trip, and I asked him if he knew my husband, but he didn't. I arrived at Geneva State Park at about 3:30 pm.  This was the first day I rode without a headwind, but it was hillier than the previous days.  For most of the evening after I arrived, it rained on and off.  There were no restaurants open in the area, so I bought a submarine sandwich at a local store for dinner. After watching another beautiful sunset, I was amazed at all the sounds in the park.  The sounds of the birds singing was almost deafening there were so many of them.  And there was some sort of a locust that buzzed for about a half hour after sunset, then again for a half hour before sunrise.  It had a different sound than any other locust I have ever heard. Total mileage today:  65.8
About six miles of rolling mesa later, I passed through the town of Hambden, also known as the town of NO PUBLIC RESTROOMS.  Both of the buildings in this dinky town had huge signs on their doors declaring this.  So, I didn't bother to stop.  And then, the three mile descent into Chardon!  At the bottom of the hill, a sign stated ?Welcome to Chardon?, but I wondered, where is everything?  Answer:  you have to climb another huge hill to get to the downtown area.  Well, when I got to the top, it was only 11:00, and I wondered if I should stop for lunch.  But then I saw the sign, "Hilltopper Cafe", and I knew I had to eat there!  They fixed me a delicious turkey sandwich and salad, and many people in the store were interested in my trip.  One of the customers had seen me climbing the hill with my rig, so he started the conversation by asking me where I was headed. Later, as I was entering the town of Chagrin Falls, I was surprised to see a popcorn factory!  I love popcorn, so I stopped and got some.   Behind the popcorn store was a stairway down to view a gorgeous waterfall.  Now I don't feel so bad about missing Niagara Falls. Several hills later, I arrived in Bedford at 6:00 pm.  Wow, today was the most mountainous day I have ever ridden. Total mileage today:  66.1  very mountainous miles   
Brecksville wins for the most difficult hills, I had to walk up two of them, they were just too steep.  One was on Riverview Road just west of Brookside Road on a "marked" bike route.  The other was on Weese Road about a mile east of there.  Entering Brecksville, I treated myself to a big breakfast at McDonalds.  After that, the day was fairly uneventful, and the terrain flattened out. On route 82, as I crossed Columbia Road, I realized, 'I'm almost home!'  Tears filled my eyes from joy and sadness.  I have triumphed and completed my dream trip, but it's almost over.  I finally arrived at the Elyria Train station to retrieve my van at about noon.  There were several people there, waiting for the train.  I wondered what adventures they were on their way to, were they as exciting as what I just did? A lot of people ask me what I think about on all those miles riding alone.  Well, I think about the beautiful scenery God has given us in this world, and how we are often traveling too fast to see it all.  I think about the awesome sounds of nature, which we usually close out in favor of air conditioning.  And I think about the wonderful aromas that we are so often too busy to notice.  And this is why I love to ride, because I have nothing to do but ride and enjoy all these things. Total Mileage Today:  44.8
100% pure New Zealand Pedaller's paradise Lonley Planet destination New Zealand
New Zealands Westcoast Map of the West Coast  When cycling north from Queenstown to Westport (or the other way round) you many many times are conviced to be riding the best bike ride in the whole world. Unless it is raining. Unfortunatly it is raining most of the time. Then you probably will be thinking something different. Especially if not only the rain makes you wet through but also the stormy wind forces your bike into the ditch. But at the end of the day - and we shared our thoughts with many other pedallers along the West Coast Highway - the conviction, that it I S the best bike ride in the world, let you forget all the endured agony.
To give you an impression just read what the tourist brochures say to promote this New Zealand number one holiday and adventure resort:  Queenstown. Home of the Bungy Jump. By A.J.Hackett. It all started with the people of Vanuatu in the Pacific, who have been throwing themselves from high towers for centuries with nothing more than a few vines tied to their feet. This ancient ritual inspired the Oxford Dangerous Sports Clubs to try a few experimental jumps back in the late 70's. As Hackett saw a video and his imagination took over, teaming up with fellow speed skier Henry van Asch they developed Bungy into the modern Ritual it is today. After some extensive stress testing on latex rubber cords a series of extreme jumps were made, first in Tignes, France, from a ski area gondola 91 meters above the snow. In June 1987 A.J. jumped from the Eiffel Tower and into the international spotlight - the Bungy legend was born. Bungyjumping with 43 meter splashdown, it's wet and cools you off. The big wilderness trip and 71 meter Bungyjump, getting there is half the thrill. You're 400 meters above the town and you've got a few choices to Bungyjump. Pipeline Bungy, 102 meters, tested on humans. Fly By Wire, six minutes of exhilarating adrenaline rush. Skydive-Tandem, the highest, the fastest, most spectacular adventure of them all. Tandem-Hanggliding, your tandem hang gliding experience. Actionflite, not only will you fly at speeds in excess of 300 kph. You will be doing it whilst experiencing up to +6 and -3 G's. Jet Safari, the first explorers to venture into magnifient wilderness. Speedboat, experience the thrust of our V8 engine as you accelerate up on the Shotover River. Riverrafting, triple thriller, helijet, jetboat ride and riverrafting. Riversurfing, the final rapid is the infamous 'Chinese Dog Leg' and a half minute of raging Grad 4 whitewater! Can't get enough! Canyoning, action, fun, bizarre, adventure. Helicopter up and Mountain Bike down. Paintball, 'Capture The Flag' or 'Storm The Fort'. Paraflying, fly stay dry. Vertigo Canyoning, an abseil adventure, plunge into pools, rappel the ravines, slide the chute, explore the canyon. Note from our diary (German): Ja auch hier hrt man von den Lawinenunglcken in den europischen Alpen. Aber das sind so ziemlich die einzigen Weltnachrichten, die bis hierhin gelangen. N.Z. scheint ziemlich mit sich selber beschftigt zu sein, zum Beispiel mit der eben beginnenden Rugby-Saison oder mit den Anschuldigungen gegenber der Prime Ministerin Jenny Shipley, der man vorwirft, das millionenschwere Budget fr den neuseelndische Tourismus anlsslich eines privaten Nacht-essens ihrem Bekannten, dem Direktor der Saatchi und Saatchi Werbeagentur, versprochen zu haben. So luft es nun mal. Nachdem wir Christchurch zu genge genossen und uns vor allem kulinarisch durch die halbe Welt gefuttert hatten, waren wir wieder bereit fr neue Abenteuer. Wir beschlossen, ganz in den Sden der Sdinsel zu reisen. Frs erste mal ohne Velo, da die Distanzen sehr weitlufig und die schnsten Orte eh nur ber Schotterstrassen zu erreichen sind. Und von denen hatten wir nach unseren tasmanischen Abenteuern eher genug... Mit einem etwas alternativen Busunternehmen, "Bottom-Bus" genannt, machten wir uns auf den Weg. Eigenlich machten wir uns schon auf das Schlimmste gefasst und rechneten mit ei-nem Bus lrmender und ungewaschener Rucksacktouristen. Doch wir wurden angenehm berrascht: Der Bus was halbleer, der Driver ein sympathischer und kompetenter Tourguide und die Route abwechslungsreich mit vielen Stops unterwegs. Wir passierten kleine Farmsiedlungen und verschlafene Provinznester. Die ganze Sd-Region wurde seit Wochen von einer grossen Trockenheit bedroht. Viele Flsse mit einem Tiefststand an Wasser, die Weiden knochentrocken, sodass die Zillionen von Schafe eher etwas verloren aus der Wolle schauten. Weiter ging's dann nordwrts nach Te Anau, dem Tor zu den Fijordlands. Dutzende von Reisebussen, Hotels, Motels, Souvenirshops, organisierte Gruppen, Backpackers, Treker, Biker, Abenteuersuchende. Wir wurden abrupt durch die neuseelndische Realitt und den florierenden Tourismus der Superlative eingeholt. Auch wir konnten uns dem nicht entziehen, wie wir bei der "must see" Tour runter zum Milford Sound erfuhren. Frhmorgens schon schlngelt sich ein fast nicht endend wollender Konvoi von Cars, Mietautos und Campervans durch eine majesttische, von Gletschern geprgte Berglandschaft: Steile Felswnde, tosende Sturzbche, breite Flusstler, dramatische Aussichtspunkte. Und dann der Sound. Zwar kreuzen rund ein Dutzend Schiffe tglich durch diese unvergleichliche Fijordlandschaft, doch einmal auf dem Boot angelangt, berfllt einem doch so etwas wie Ruhe, Gelassenheit und Bewunderung fr diese einmalige Szenerie. Dann Queenstown, noch weniger nach unserem Geschmack. Hier wurde das Bungyjumpen erfunden, seitem ist es zur Heimat aller "Thrillseeker" geworden: Wer hat noch nicht genug von Riverraften, Skydiven, Jetboaten, Paragliden, Helibiken....? Tag und Nacht ist hier Betrieb und wir sind froh, endlich wieder unsere Velos in Empfang nehmen zu knnen." Unser Ziel ist es nun, von Queenstown aus an die Westkste und dann den Highway hoch bis Westport zu radeln. Was ist so speziell daran? Nun ja, es handelt sich um die Gegend, mit der hchsten durchschnittlichen Regenmenge in N.Z. Und es ist die Heimat der berchtigten Sandflies. Kleine lstige Biester, die sich mit Vorliebe an den Kncheln festsaugen. Aber es ist auch der Ort, wo sich die Strasse zwischen den steilen und schneebedeckten Abhngen der Sdalpen und der tosenden Tasmanischen See durchschlngelt und sich durch einen tiefgrnen und dichten Urwald windet. 
Diese letzte Nacht im Backpackers hat es in sich. In den nahegelegenen Bierlokalen und auf der Strasse festet die internationale Adventure- und Backpackergemeinde bis in die frhen Morgenstunden. Und schon ab sechs Uhr drhnen und stinken die Busse wieder abfahrtsbereit, direkt vor unserem Zimmer. ber einige kleinere Hgel verlassen wir die Stadt. Endlich wieder auf dem Rad! Und dann geht es fast nur noch bergab: 15 km bis zur Kawaru Bridge. Von dieser historischen Hngebrcke strzen sich die Bungyjumper in die Tiefe, wahlweise trocken oder nass, was einem kurzen Eintaucher ins eisgrne Flusswasser gleichkommt. Zuvor winken sie aber in die bereitstehende Video- und Sofortbildkamera und lassen sich von den Instruktoren Mut zusprechen. Wir beobachten das eifrige Geschehen. Schwatzen mit den wagemutigen SpringerInnen, die da im Minutentakt - um gute hundert Dollar rmer - vorbeipilgern. Unten im Fluss passiert eine Gruppe Whitewater-Riverrafter ebenfalls die Stelle. Sie machen Rast, um als weitere Mutprobe, von einem zwei Meter hohen Felsvorsprung ins Wasser zu springen. Wir galoppieren mit unseren Drahteseln weiter gen Westen. Auf der Fahrt gibt es zwei Attraktionen zu bestaunen. Eine der ersten Goldgrbersiedlungen in Neuseeland, heute eine ruhige und gemchliche Touristenattraktion, und die riesigen Obstplantagen, die sich quadratkilometergross der Strasse entlang reihen. Alle 500 Meter stehen Marktstnde, wo die frischen Frchte angeboten werden. Wir kaufen pralle Aprikosen, saftige Tomate und einen sssduftenden Pfirsich, "Whoppa" genannt, der fast so gross ist wie eine Melone. ber das Dorf Cromwell gibt es nicht viel zu berichten, eine Shopping Mall, einen Golfplatz, einen Supermarkt und Hunderte von Feriensiedlungen und Huser. Auf dem Zeltplatz treffen wir auf Zweirad-Kollegen. Ein australisch/neuseelndisches Prchen mit Tandem, zwei Deutsche mit Fahrrad und ein Motorradfahrer aus Japan. 
Ein schwler Morgen erwartet uns. Bei 20 Grad und wolkenverhangenem Himmel fahren wir los. Unsere Route folgt dem Lake Hawea, einer berwiegend flachen Strecke, nur mit kleinen Hgeln unterbrochen. Nach einer Stunde beginnt es zu nieseln. Der Regen hrt zwar gleich wieder auf, wird aber von einem leichten Wind abgelst, der direkt auf uns zublst. Er wird strker und wir versuchen uns mglichst aerodynamisch auf den Rdern zu halten. Doch die Naturgewalt fordert bald schon die letzte Kraft. Auf dem See werden die Wellen aufgewhlt, ein Sturm ist im Anmarsch. Wir radeln durch weite Graslandschaften und Schafweiden, die von vereinzelten Baumgruppen unterbrochen werden und erreichen das Dorf Wanaka. Hier begann ein arbeitsloser Aussteigertyp in den 70er Jahren mit dem Bau eines Labyrinths, den er bald den Touristen ffnete. Die waren so begeistert von seiner Idee, dass er dem Garten eine dritte Dimension hinzufgte. Damit errang er lokalen, nationalen und bald schon internationalen Ruhm, und fortan war er in der ganzen weiten Welt damit beschftigt, weitere Irrgrten zu bauen, was besonders die spielfreudige Seele der Japaner entzckte. Wir entscheiden uns trotz strmischen Wetter weitere zwlf Kilometer zu fahren und unser Zelt am Lake Hawea, auf einem direkt am See gelegen Zeltplatz aufzubauen. Inzwischen hat die Windgeschwindigkeit orkanartige Ausmasse erreicht und wir bangen um die Sturmtauglichkeit unserer Ausrstung.  
Letzten Abend hatten wir eine Auseinandersetzung mit unserem Kocher. Der Treibstoff Kerosen wollte nicht brennen, eigentlich erzeugte er nur schwarzen Rauch und Stichflammen. Dazu tobte der Sturm und wir waren hungrig und mde. Das heisst, unsere Nerven lagen ziemlich blank. Auch heute kmpfen wir auf dem Fahrrad gegen den Wind, diesmal blst er mit doppelter Kraft auf uns zu. Dabei knnte diese Tagesetappe, den beiden Seen Hawea und Wanaka entlang, so vieles frs Auge bieten. Doch die nahen Berghnge der Southern Alps bleiben hinter drohend, dunklen Wolken verborgen. Eigentlich wren da eisbedeckte Bergspitzen, kalte Regenwlder und stiebende Wasserflle. Die Gegend ist einsam, keine Drfer, keine Siedlungen, fast keine Menschen. Unterwegs begegnen wir nur ein paar weiteren Radfahrern. Die meisten haben noch ehrgeizige Tagesziel vor sich. Es scheint jeden Augenblick losgiessen zu wollen. Im Shell Tankstellen-Shop in Makarora decken wir uns mit Trockennahrung ein Minestrone, Erbsen und Tee. Letzte Einkaufsmglichkeit fr 90 Kilometer. dann beginnt der Regen. Es giesst aus Kbeln und wir strampeln die letzten 12 km bis zum D.O.C.-Campground (Departement of Conservation) in verzweifeltem Tempo ab. Natrlich campiert hier heute kein Schwein. Es ist auch bloss ein einfaches kleines Stck Rasen, direkt am Waldrand gelegen. Ein mobiles Plumpsklo, eine Informationstafel, ein Briefkasten, um die fnf Doller Campinggebhr zu begleichen, kein trockenes Pltzchen, um unterzustehen, that's it. Wir werden herzlichst von einer Meute Sandflies begrsst. Sie machen sich sofort auf Nahrungssuche und finden diese auf unseren Hand- und Fussgelenken, im Nacken, hinter den Ohren.... Christian versucht, sich im nahegelegenen Fluss den Schweiss des Tages abzuwaschen. Eine gute Idee, finden die Sandflies. Bei der anhaltenden Feuchtigkeit und dem immer noch gleich untauglichen Brennstoff wie am vorhergehenden Abend, hat der Kocher seine Startprobleme. Fluchen, Schreien, Weinen, ein letztes verzweifeltes Stossgebet und die Suppe wird irgendwann, irgendwie trotzdem noch warm. Wir sind von Kopf bis Fuss vermummt. Mindestens zwei Schichten wrmendes und trockenhaltendes Material, das uns vor der Nsse und den Sandfliegen schtzen soll. Unvergesslich diese heisse Suppe. Es regnet fortwhrend, die Tropfen klatschen vom Himmel und von den nahestehenden Bumen auf die Zeltplane. Alles hlt dicht, trotzdem kriecht die Feuchtigkeit durch alle Ritzen. Das andauernde Trommeln hlt wach, nur hie und dann dsen wir weg, um gleich vom reissenden Fluss zu trumen, der uns mitsamt Sack und Pack davon schwemmt.
Es ist Morgen und es regnet in Strmen. Unter den schtzenden Zeltplanen aber auf beengendem Platz versuchen wir unsere sieben Sachen zu organisieren, zu packen und zu frhstcken. Draussen vor dem Moskitonetz wetzen sich bereits wieder Hunderte von Sandflies die Beisserchen. Wir starten knapp acht Kilometer unterhalb der Passhhe (535 m . M.). Trotzdem wird diese nasse Bergetappe zur ultimativen Herausforderung. Im Dauerregen stossen wir die Rder den letzten, allzu steilen Kilometer, den Berg hoch. Klatschnass erreichen wir die Passhhe, Grenze zwischen den Distrikten Central Otago und Westlands. Dann geht's endlich nur noch abwrts. Es ist eindrcklich, wie sich die Strasse durch dichte, moosbehangene Regenwlder windet. Das gesammelte Regenwasser strzt sich in Hunderten von Wasserfllen ins Tal. Manche Wasserflle erzeugen im Flussbecken eine derartige Wassergischt, dass dichte Nebelwolken durch das Tal ziehen. Die Regenpellerine ist lngst nicht mehr dicht, auch die Hnde sind von der Feuchtigkeit aufgeweicht und fhlen sich klamm an. Das Wasserbett in den Schuhen lsst unangenehme Klte die Waden hochsteigen. Wir auf einer Tour de France-Bergetappen preschen wir den Berg hinunter, in der Hoffnung, bald auf ein trockenes Zimmer, ein kuscheliges Bett und eine heisse Dusche zu stossen. Dieses befindet sich in Haast Township, im Motor Inn, das fr einmal seinen Preis wert ist. Der kleine Elektroofen luft auf Hochtouren, das Zimmerklima verwandelt sich alsbald in ein tropisches Abenteuer. Aber wirklich clever ist der grosse Gerteschuppen nebenan, wo wir Zelt aufzuspannen und trocknen lassen knnen. Ist das ein Leben! Fernseher, heisser Tee, Kche und Doppelbett. Wir versorgen uns im nahegelegenen Supermarkt und buchen gleich eine weitere Nacht, da die Wettervorhersagen keine Besserung in Aussicht stellen. 
Wet, wet, wet die weiteren Aussichten. Wir entscheiden uns am bernchsten Tag trotzdem, die Reise fortzusetzen. Zumal es am Morgen etwas schont. Wir berqueren Flusslufe. Eine schnurgerade Strasse fhrt der See entlang. Ab und zu durchschneidet sie den Regenwald, dessen Vegetation von Menschenhand weitgehend unberhrt geblieben ist. Sie weckt Erinnerungen an ferne Zeiten und verwunschene Sagenwelten. Wie die wilden Ritter reiten wir auf unseren Blechrssern durch die verzauberten Urlandschaft. Ab und zu taucht zwischen den mit Moos und Flechten behangenen Bumen ein Teich auf. Was schlummert auf dessen Grund? Dann wieder scheint hinter dem Bltter- und Buschgewirr ein Dinosaurier aufzutauchen. Oder erregte bloss ein abgestorbener Baumstamm die Fantasie? Weiterhin kmpfen wir gegen den Wind. Sehr zum Aerger von Christian. Wtend schiebt er sein Rad an den Strassenrand und steht - unverhofft - mittendrin in prall behangenden Brombeerstruchern. Eine Pause, vier Hnde greifen nach Beeren und das seelische Gleichgewicht ist wieder hergestellt. Um zum Knights Point zu gelangen, mssen zuerst drei respektable Klippen berwunden werden. Wtendende Windben und ein Dauerregen, der erneut einsetzt, machen uns das Leben schwer. Unter uns tobt die tasmanische See und wirft graue Wellen schumend an die Felsen. Es strmt was das Zeugs hlt und in einem schtzenden Unterstand ziehen wir uns trockene Sachen ber. Thermowsche und Regenhosen geben minimalen Schutz. So erreichen wir Lake Paringa und die gleichnamige Lodge, in der Hoffnung auf ein trockenes Bett. 
In Lake Paringa glaubten wir wieder einmal den Tiefpunkt erreicht zu haben, als wir ein muffiges (und berrissen teures) Quartier bezogen, das wir spter auch noch mit zwei, ebenfalls durchnssten, Deutschen Radtouristen teilen mussten. Wenigstens gab es ein Caf mit warmem Essen und freundliche Menschen. Draussen blieben smtliche Himmelsschleusen weiterhin geffnet. Es schien, als wrde jemand den Versuch unternehmen, die gesamte Westkste in die Tasmanische See zu splen. Besserung war auch nicht in Sicht, als wir uns schlafen legten und uns (alle vier!) gegenseitig Mut zu sprachen. Wrde der nchste Tag wirklich das ersehnte trockene Wetter bringen? Doch was keiner zu hoffen wagte, trifft tatschlich ein: Am Morgen tropft es zwar noch von den nassen Bumen, und aus dem Buschland steigen dichte Nebelwolken, doch der Wind hat sich gelegt und ber uns zeigen sich erste blaue Flecken, die die Wolkendecke durchbrechen. Ein herrlicher Velotag beginnt! Khle frische Temperaturen, einsame, schnurgerade Strassen, die uns durch dichten Regenwald fhren. Die Sonne leuchtet golden im Gegenlicht und bringt alles zum Glitzern. Vgel zwitschern aus dem dichten Gest, die in den Waldlichtungen grasenden Khe, Schafe und Pferde blicken uns sehnschtig nach. Was gibt es schneres, als unter solchen Bedingungen ber flache Strassen zu fliegen? So schnell sind wir noch nie unterwegs gewesen, trotzdem geniessen wir jeden Meter der Strecke, bis uns in der Nhe des Etappenzieles, Fox Glacier, wieder die Realitt einholt: Das Verkehrsaufkommen nimmt zu, die Touristen wirken gehetzt, berall werden teure Attraktionen angeboten. Vom Campingplatz aus beobachten wir die startenden und landenden Helikopter, die im Fnfminutentakt die Talschaft hinaufklettern, um denjenigen Menschen, die immer nur vom Grssten trumen, eine kurze Befriedigung mit Flightseeing ber der Gletscherlandschaft zu verschaffen.
Mit dem Lrm der ersten Helikopterflge erwachen wir um Sieben Uhr. Die Feuchtigkeit, die sich in der Nacht als Tau auf unserem Zelt abgesetzt hat, tropft uns auf das Gesicht. Es ist Zeit aufzustehen. Langsam steigen wir aus dem Schlafsack, packen unsere Taschen und spannen die feuchten Zeltteile an die Wscheleine zum Trocknen. Dann, kurz vor unserer Abfahrt, sind alle Wolken verschwunden, und wir haben einen schnen Ausblick auf den Mt. Cook und den Fox Glacier. Auf den nchsten 18 Kilometern stehen drei Berge an, die zu berwinden, unsere letzte Kraftreserven kosten. Unmittelbar hinter der Bergkette liegt die nchste Gletscherzunge, Franz Josef Glacier. Auch hier scheint es, als ob jeder Tourist einen Helikopterflug in die Umgebung unternehmen muss. Wir machen Pause, essen etwas in einem Caf, kaufen Lebensmittel fr die nchsten zwei Tage ein und beobachten den Rummel. Ist das eine Hektik, Busse voll mit Touristen stoppen vor dem Besucherzentrum. Wo sind die Attraktionen, wo ist die Helikopter-Basis? Reicht die halbe Stunde, bis der Bus wieder weiterfhrt? Schaffen wir es heute Abend noch bis Queenstown? Uns reicht es. Was wir jetzt wieder gebrauchen knnten, ist die Ruhe und Einsamkeit, die Schnheit und die Mystik, die diesen Teil Neuseelands ausmachen. So fahren wir einige anstrengende Kilometer weiter, um das kleine Fischerdrfchen Okarito, das abseits des des Highways gelegen ist, zu besuchen. Hinter dem Dnen, die das Meer und seinen weiten, von Treibholz bersten Strand vom Dorf abtrennen, stehen vielleicht zwanzig Huser, manche davon zweistckig, aber alle mit freier Sicht auf das Meer. Das ehemalige Schulhaus wurde zur kleinsten Jugendherberge Neuseelands umgebaut. Der General Store steht nur noch als Museumsfassade da. Auf dem Zeltplatz zwitschern geschftig die Vgel. Wir suchen uns einen Platz aus zwischen Eukalyptusbumen und Agaven. Hier scheint es sich um einen geheimen Radlertreffpunkt zu handeln. Nach und nach trifft eine internationale Gsteschar auf dem Platz ein und eifrig werden Tourentipps und Erfahrungen ausgetauscht. Wir haben uns auf den ersten Blick in Okarito verliebt. Es ist schwer sich vorzustellen, dass vor 150 Jahren dieses Dorf eine gut organisierte Goldgrbersiedlung war. Hier lebten 5'000 Einwohner, es gab zwei Theater, ein Metzgerei, zwei Bcker, den grssten Warenhndler an der Westkste und eben dieses eine Schulhaus. Doch das ist alles lngst Geschichte. Heute leben hier Aussteiger und Eigenbrtler, Eingefleischte und Zugewanderte. Unter anderem die preisgekrnte Neuseelndische Schriftstellerin Keri Hulmes. (Anm. Spter, irgendwo auf einer Sdseeinsel, werde ich dann ihren Roman "The Bone People" lesen und viel an diesen zauberhaften Ort zurckdenken mssen.) Wir schlendern durchs Dorf und schauen uns die schmucken Huser an. Es leben gerade mal zwanzig Leute das ganze Jahr ber im Dorf. Nachdem wir den Ausflug in die Lagune fr den nchsten Tag reserviert haben, spazieren wir am Strand entlang zurck und geniessen die romantischen Eindrcke, als die Sonne langsam ins Meer taucht
Wir nehmen uns den ganzen Tag Zeit, um Okarito und die Umgebung zu erkunden. Am Morgen wandern wir eine gute Stunde den Strand entlang. Nach eingehender Konsultation der Gezeitentabelle starten wir um 9:15 Uhr, eine Stunde bevor die Ebbe ihren tiefsten Punkt erreicht. Die brausenden Wellen bringen das Meer zum schumen. Im Morgenlicht spiegelt sich die Sonne auf der Gischt, das Wasser scheint in der Luft zu tanzen. Wir begegnen Mwen, scheuchen Austernfischer beim Muschelknacken auf und suchen unseren Weg durch die engen Sandpassagen. Es ist ein friedlicher Morgen. Am Ende der Kstenwanderung liegt die Three Mile Lagoon, tiefschwarzes, spiegelglattes Wasser, worin sich die farnbehangenen Ab-hnge spiegeln. Auf der zum Meer zugewandten Seite badet eine Stelzenluferfamilie. Der Rckweg ins Dorf fhrt durch feuchten Regenwald. Wir steigen den Hgel hinauf, langsam und immer mehr rinnt uns der Schweiss ber die Stirn. Als wir das Dorf wieder erreichen, sind wir ganz durchnsst. Dann machen wir uns auf die Kajaktour durch die Okarito Salzwasserlagune. Wir stehen vor dem kleinen Huschen der "Okarito Lagoon Tours" und lassen und von dem sympathischen Ehepaar in die Welt der Kajaking einfhren. Kurz die Schwimmweste anprobieren, der Gummirock sitzt, wie hlt man schon wieder so ein Ruder und dann ab ins feuchte Vergngen. An der durch Holzpfosten gekennzeichneten Route entlang paddeln wir durch die Lagune. Man kann auch verschiedene Flussarme erkunden. Die Vogelwelt um uns herum ist einzigartig. Wir sehen Silberreiher, schwarze Schwne, Kingfisher, Habichte, Tauben. Die noch hereinkommende Flut treibt uns langsam die Flussarme hoch, wir navigieren zwischen Bumen und kleinen Wasserschnellen hindurch. Vier Stunden lang begegnen wir keiner Menschenseele. Das Paddeln ist trotzdem anstrengend, zwanzig Ruderschlge, eine Pause, Zum Schluss in der brtender Nachmittagshitze paddeln wir um die Wette und - weil wir etwas zu frh dran sind - gegen die Gezeiten. Der Guide winkt uns vom Ufersteg zu und wir zeigen ihm voller Stolz unsere Kajakknste. 
Ein heisser Tag steht uns bevor, das verkndet der wolkenlose Himmel schon frhmorgens. Doch die Fahrt ist abwechslungsreich und fhrt uns immer wieder durch den dichten und schattigen Urwald. Wir besichtigen unterwegs einen Giant Matai Tree. Ein Fantail-Vogel glaubt sich unbeobachtet und zwitschert und tnzelt durchs Gest. In Whataroa machen wir eine verdiente Pause, strken uns im Tearoom und weiter geht die Fahrt ber offenes Farmland mit Blick auf eisige Flsse und schneebedeckte Berge. Ein heftiger Gegenwind weht die Bergflanken hinunter und zerrt an unseren Lenkstangen, reduziert unsere Durchschnittsge-schwindigkeit grad mal um die Hlfte, und verfhrt Christian zu heftigen Schimpftiraden. Nichts hilft. Die letzten Kilometer bis Harihari strampeln wir unter der brtenden Sonne, augetrocknet und verschwitzt. Wir sind froh, ein angenehmes und sauberes Motelzimmer zu finden. Die Landlady in ihrem schnen Huschen ist eine gemtliche Person. Dicklich wie ihr Hndchen und von Rheuma geplagt, wie sie uns erzhlt. So einen heissen Tag wie heute, htte sie seit ihrer Jugendzeit nicht mehr erlebt, meint sie, als wir wieder beim Lieblingsthema Nr. 1 der Westkstenbewohner, dem Wetter, angelangt sind. Zum Glck gibts im Pub gleich ber die Strasse angenehm khles Bier und reichliches Essen. Wir bewundern die Fotosammlung, die von der legendren Bruchlandung des ersten Trans-Tasman-Fluges im Sumpf vor Harihari zeugt. Alle Dorfbewohner hatten sich in einem Gruppenbild um den demolierten Flieger gescharrt, der Pilot berlebte, eine detailierte Namensliste hlt Zeitzeugen fest.
Trotz eines nchtlichen Sturzregens haben sich am frhen Morgen schon wieder alle Wolken verzogen. Aus der weiten Flussebene, die vor uns liegt, steigen Nebelschwaden empor, die Khe suchen frstelnd die ersten Sonnenstrahlen. Wir strampeln weiter, die Morgenkhle ausnutzend. Bis Ross bleibt die Landschaft im gewohnten Westkstenstil, abwechslungsreich und leicht hgelig. Wir besichtigen die ehemalige und auch heute noch aktive Goldgrberstadt Ross, machen Mittagsrast und strken uns fr den zweiten Teil der langen Etappe. Unter der gnadenlosen Sonne erwartet uns eine lange, schnurgerade und schattenlose Strecke, sodass wir die verbleibenden Kilometer bis Hokitika fast ohne Pause durchradeln und einen neuen Dauergeschwindigkeitsrekord aufstellen. Obwohl der Campingplatz in Hokitika einer Baugrube hnelt, entschliessen wir uns, in "Hoki" einen Tag Pause einzulegen. Endlich wieder Zivilisation. Wir schlendern durch die Jade-Geschfte, fllen Vorrte auf und entspannen die heissgelaufenen Wdli.
Wir wachen unsanft auf, doch kein Ausharren in Schlafsack ntzt, die Taschen mssen im strmenden Regen gepackt werden. Ein kleines Frhstck unter der schtzenden Zeltplane, draussen regnet es weiter. Der State Highway 6 schlngelt sich zwischen der Meereskste und den kstennahen Hgeln hindurch, meistens flach aber ganz schn feucht. Es regnet auf verschiedene Arten: Sanft wie ein Schleier von oben, dann kleine harte Tropfen, die ins Gesicht prasseln, oder windgepeitschte Nsse, die vom Meer her drckt. Die Feuchtigkeit kriecht ber die Hnde die Arme hoch, gleichzeitig rinnt das Wasser dem Hals entlang den Rcken und den Bauch hinunter. Einzelne Tropfen gleiten ber das Gesicht und man kann der salzigem Geschmack von Meerluft und Schweiss kosten. Zu guter letzt tropft das Wasser von den Hosen auf die Socken und rein in die Schuhe. Mit zunehmender Dauer bekommt man das Gefhl, als trete man in einem unterkhlten Schlammbad. Und als ob das alles nicht genug wre, brausen da noch die riesigen LKWs vorbei, die die Pftzen wasserwerferartig ber die Strasse verteilen. Brumm, und schon wieder mitten ins Gesicht! Wusch, eine Breitseite ber die bereits durchnssten Regenkleider! In Greymouth regnet es immer noch, vielmehr, es prasselt ein Sturzback herab. In so einem Fall trstet nur das beste Hotel vor Ort ber die erlittenen Qualen hinweg. Braune, feuchte Fahrradspuren fhren ber den schnen Spannteppich in der Empfangshalle, wie zwei tropfende Gartenzwerge versuchen wir die Check-in-Formulare auszufllen...
Unsere Entscheidung, diesen Streckabschnitt mit dem Bus zu fahren, stellte sich am Morgen als richtig heraus. Dicke, schwarze Wolken liegen immer noch ber Greymouth und eine starke Brise zieht durch die Stadt. In Punakaiki haben wir fr zwei Nchte ein Zimmer in einem einfachen Hostel, zwanzig Meter vom Strand entfernt, gebucht. Wir nehmen uns Zeit, etwas auszuspannen, besuchen am Morgen die Pancake Rocks. Die strmische See hat an diesem Strand bizarre Formen in den Sandstein gewaschen. Wie Pfannkuchen liegen mehrere Schichten Gestein aufeinander und formen so eigenartige Klippen. Dort wo die Wellen an die Felsen schlagen, donnert das Wasser durch schmale Kaminlcher in die Hhe. Regelmssig stiebt die Gischt aus den Blowholes, befeuchtet ringsum die Erde, sodass eine eigenartige Moosvegetation entsteht. Hier ist der Ausgangspunkt einiger abenteuerlicher Wanderrouten. Mehrere davon fhren durch den tiefen Regenwald, ber wilde Flsse, zum Teil ohne erkennbaren Track. Wir wagen uns auf den Pororari River Track bis die Gabelung zum Inland Pack Track erfolgt. Immer dem Fluss entlang, wandern wir unter einem schtzenden Farmbltterdach. Der Boden ist von den Regengssen schlammig und aufgeweicht. Im Fluss schwimmen ste, ja ganze Baumstmme. Von einem Rastplatz aus beobachten wir einen Kormoran, der, auf einem Stein mitten im Fluss sitzend, ein Sonnenbad geniesst. Wir trecken weiter, ber rutschige Sandsteinb-den, feuchte Sandbetten, wir balancieren ber Felsvorsprnge, winden uns unter durch Felsspalten, bis wir an einer Flussmndung die Expedition aufgeben mssen. Das Wasser ist zu tief, die Brcke, die darber fhrte, nicht mehr passierbar. Wir kehren um, und lassen uns noch einmal von dieser fremden, wilden und faszinierenden Flusslandschaft und Urwaldvegetation begeistern. Unvergessliche Eindrcke bleiben fr immer: Gurgelnde Flussgerusche, gigantische Farnbume, unbekannte Tierlaute, die aus dem Wald dringen. Am Abend entspannen wir uns in der Punakaiki Tavern und geniessen neuseelndische Lebenskultur und Gastfreundschaft. Rex, der Lwenjgerhund schnffelt sich von Tisch zu Tisch, ein Glas Speights rinnt locker die Kehle runter. An der Wand hngt der Fernseher und Sky Television bertrgt ein Super 12 Rugbyspiel. Die Stimmung ist munter. Ausschnitt aus einem E-Mail von Christine: "Nach em Rge schiint d'Sunne" bldeln wir beim Nachtessen, whrend sich draussen die Bsche dem Wind biegen und der Regen sturzbachartig aufs Dach und gegen die Fenster trommelt. Einfach drber schlafen und optimistisch bleiben. Tatschlich: Im Morgenlicht glitzert der See, aus dem Wald, der tropfnass ist, steigen Nebelschwaden empor, hinter dem Berggipfel lugt die Sonne hervor. Die folgenden Tage werden wir belohnt mit strahlendem Sonnenschein, ja ungewhnlich heissen Tagen, unvergleichlichen Landschaftsbildern, Urwldern, Vgeln, Gletschern, Strnden, Seen und Lagunen. Die Route ist einfach toll zum Radfahren. Es hat fast kein Verkehr und wir finden die Ruhe und die Ein-samkeit, die wir uns erhofft haben. So vergehen die Tage. Wir campieren viel, treffen hufig Radler an, mit denen wir Erfahrungen und Reiseplne austauschen. Einmal mehr verlieren wir das Gefhl fr Zeit und Raum. Schliesslich sind wir auch ziemlich abgeschieden von der Welt. Entlang der ganzen Westkste keine Natelverbindung, die paar internetfhigen Computer, die wir finden, sind meist out of order oder berlastet. In Punaikaiki schliesslich bricht auch noch der Strom und das Telefonnetz fr einige Stunden zusammen."
Es regnet bereits morgens um Sieben, und wir mssen unseren ersten Startversuch abbrechen. Also beobachten wir die Wetterfront, die eigentlich Besseres versprochen hatte. Von woher weht der Wind eigentlich? Ah ja, aus dem Osten. Das wrde bedeuten, mit zunehmender Windstrke und falls diese Flecken dort am Horizont wirklich blauen Himmel andeuten, knnten wir in einer Stunde losfahren. Also warten wir ab. Dann um Acht Uhr, der Himmel immer noch leicht bedeckt, geht's los. Gleich zu Beginn sind zwei Steigungen zu meistern. Die Strasse klettert die steilen Felsklippen hoch, mitten durch den dichten Regenwald. Dann folgt eine rasante Abfahrt. Im Osten formen sich erneut dunkle, bedrohliche Regenwolken und obwohl wir versuchen, dem Gewitter zu entfliehen, holt es uns ein. Ein warmer, staubartiger Regenguss geht nieder, eine weitere Bergstrecke gilt es zu berwinden. Mittlerweile peitscht der Regen etwas unfreundlicher ins Gesicht und wieder dringt die Nsse langsam ein, bis sie das innerste Kleidungsstck aufgeweicht hat. Bei Kilometer 30 erreichen wir Charleston. Zusammen mit drei anderen Velofahrern wrmen wir uns im lokalen Pub mit heissem Tee auf. Mit einem Amerikaner tauschen wir aktuelle Nachrichten aus. Es gibt viel zu plaudern: ber das Wetter, die langen Steigungen, die Streckenwahl, ber das Woher und Wohin. Der letzte Teil der Etappe ist flach und verluft mehrheitlich der Kste entlang. Zudem blst ein krftiger Wind endlich mal vom Rcken her, und macht das Radeln zu einer einfacher Angelegenheit.
Das letzte Dorf am Nordende der Westkste gelegen, lebt heute vom Fischfang und der Zementherstellung. In der nheren Umgebung wurde bis vor 20 Jahren Kohle im Tagbau gefrdert. Der Hafen war ein weltweit wichtiger Gterumschlagplatz.  Per Rad unternehmen wir unseren letzten Westkstenausflug und fahren hinaus zur Pelzrobbenkolonie. Zu dieser Jahreszeit sind die Jungen etwa acht Wochen alt. Sie spielen im seichten Wasser, robben durch den Seetang, ben mit den Wellen, whrend die Mtter sich auf den Felsen ein Sonnenbad genehmigen. Im nahen Bistro-Restaurant, mit dem schnen Namen "Where fresh food and the ocean meet", verspeisen wir zwei Stck exquisite Kuchen und geniessen die Aussicht von der Terasse. Das also ist das Ende unseres Westkstenabenteuers. Wir sind nun mit "allen Wassern gewaschen" und bereit fr neue Veloabenteuer. Oder - wie Christian dies in einem E-Mail beschreibt: "Das Leben auf zwei Rdern ist sehr angenehm, entspannend. Wir berlegen, ob dies nicht gleich fr den Rest des Lebens so bleiben knnte."
  Riding a tandem across America East to West (4230 miles is a very special trip for us, this journal records a Nine day tour we did in November 2002. We cycled with the Cycle Touring Association of Western Australia.(click to show email) We looked on it as one of a few warm ups in readiness to the BIG ONE. We can be contacted at click to show email  This tour was in the South West of Western Australia. A group of 120 cyclists participated in the tour some coming from the Eastern States of Australia. The tour offered a sag vehicle, mechanical support and two meals a day. Accommodation was in your own tent. Catering for the evening meal was arranged with local groups such as Apex, Rotary and High Schools and assisted them in their fund raising activities. About 120 riders take part in the annual event that chooses a different region on Western Australia each year. The rides are a huge success and all places are booked out months in advance.     This years ride started in a small town called Kendernup just north of Mount Barker (for 9 days). We passed through a lot of land growing grapes, of course the grapes are used for wine manufacture so obviously we HAD to sample the product - as OFTEN as possible. The coast line in this part of the world is splendid to the eye. It abounds with ocean life. Albany was until a few years ago home to a whaling station. Fortunately that activity stopped in the mid seventies, but a very interesting museum exist where once the whales were dragged ashore and processed. The mileage we will do on this Whale of a Tour will kick start our training regime building up to cycling the TransAmerican Trail USA . We are lucky we live close to a Freeway cycle path so we are able to get in lots of kilometers without the worry of traffic On this tour we took many item we never even used, particulary clothing, we (Trish) will have to be a lot more disciplined in what we actually take for the big one. The organisation committee(CTA) including the volunteers deserve a big pat on the back for a an excellent job well done, one problem COLD SHOWERS. We are city slickers not used to them !! Well actually the mens showers seemed to be warm most of the time but the ladies were often cold. That didnt stop Trish though, she got Phill to guard the door to the men's community showers whilst she took a hot shower after the days ride. If you cant beat 'em join 'em or at least tell 'em to clear off is her motto (well it is an equal opportunity world we live in). 
When we arrived there were already some familiar faces from last years trip.  The bus arrived from Perth with the rest of the crew 120 people in all, it was great to catch up with everyone again the meeting place was such a hipe of chit chatter about who had done what and where during the previous year. With all the bikes unloaded from the truck and cars parked for the 9 days we all set off for our first part of the trip , we first cycled to Kendenup Hall for lunch (cannot ride on an empty stomach. After lunch we set off on our journey to Mt Barker.  Tonight we are camping in the local Caravan Park. Lots of trees and grass and just a short stroll into town for a coffee (and cake).  Today was a short ride a very good ride a few hills which wasn't to bad (little did we know there were many more and steeper ones to come). The weather was very wet towards the end of the ride. We heard at the camp ground that one of the Tandem teams had taken a fall. They had slipped on a railway crossing. Luckily not too serious just a bit of skin missing.  We had dinner at the hall in town which was organise and cooked by the local community Excellent as always.   
We go back to the hall were we ate last night for the traditional Toast and Porridge breakfast that will power us to morning tea tea stop. We cross the highway and start the climb towards the Porongurup Ranges. The ride was really good with plenty of down hill and a fair share of up hills but the down hill rides more than made up for the up ones. Plenty of wild life to see (snakes) and the biggest Red Kangaroo I had ever seen jumped straight accross the road in front of our bike very impressive sight. We stopped for morning tea at the 30klm mark and a welcome cuppa it was - Phill found a cake from somewhere.     We arrived in Albany about 1pm We are camping in the Albany Recreation Hall grounds theres plenty of room for the tents but we are supprised to hear that there is a live concert by MIDNIGHT OIL performing at the centre. Not much chance of an early night tonight. I was awake most of last night and Phill was awake early so the thought of a Rock Band keeping us awake was not something we wanted. Nothing against Midnight Oil but we decided we would pike out tonight and  get a room at the local Caravan Park and I must say we had the best night sleep and a very HOT shower (little did we know that this was probably going to be our last hot one for the trip).   Whilst in Albany we took the opportunity to call into family we hadn't seen for a few years , good to catch up. Excellent meal again at the sports club. The object is while doing all this travelling we would lose some weight but the meals we get are so good that pardon the pun (Fat chance of that). 
The town folk of Albany must have been suprised to see so many cyclists on their streets. Various little groups set off to visited the Whaling Station, Blow Holes etc. Phil called into the Old Jail Museum were a local lady ambushed him and told him the whole history of Albany - well she was set to and managed half of it till Trish rescued him. He loves history and would have spent the whole day talking with her as she was so informed. After the mandatory coffee stop (Phill had a cake) we joined Wendy and Pat (alias Jo) for a ride to Middleton Beach and then on to Emu Point. The weather was absolutely gorgeous. Setting off from the coffee shop was interesting,we struggled like hell up the hill then turned and found we had to peddle even going down hill. The two girls in front of us were getting further and further away from us, when trish released the Drum Brake was still on,we just about span the back wheel and vowed to make sure the brake level will be double checked to ensure the brake is OFF before we start riding in the future.    Plenty of wild life yet again,lots of black King skinks or are they lizards ? around here, and would you believe it quite a few big hills, but fun anyway. The coast line here has an excellent Bike path to follow. the path is raised and affords a great view out to sea. The water is cold in these parts for most of the year today is no exception.     We stopped off for an icecream at Emu Point and meet up with some fellow cyclists, they were guys from the Perth "Over 55's Cycling Club" that joined us for this years tour, all very nice people.     
We left Albany town traveling West. The coast here is rugged and there are many granite hills to see and such a beautiful sight.  The ride was uneventful apart from a few snakes here and there!!!Lots of wildlife out at the moment some of the flower are just so pretty, weather at around 24C, although now into the afternoon we have a very good head wind make life a tadd harder. Morning tea was just after Cosy Corner (Phill had a cake again). Mary one of the cyclists who we be-friended (nothing to do with the fact that she picks a nice bottle of red wine or that she looks after us at meal times) just a very lovely lady, sat behind us and drafted for about 15klm which was good for her. The road was almost a straight run than was beauty, but we are finding it very hard going up the hills on the Tandem, great coming down but oh boy, havock on the legs. We arrive at Denmark in exceeding good time, my Knee which I had operated on not too long ago was doing okay.  The Melbourne Cup was being run today. The Cup (a hourse racebrings Australia to a stand still) was being televised at the local pub where a lot of the tour group flocked to watch and cheer. We sat on the bank of the river and watched wild ducks and geese swimming up and down. It was not long till someone suggested a coffee so off we went (guess what Phill had). We arrive at the camp site and looking forward to a nice hot shower, no chance cold again. Trish wasn't going to let that stop her this time. She decided to rock up at the men's shower and wait until they had finished, well cannot lie she hurried them up a little and then Phill kept guard whilst she had a piping hot shower to her hearts content. She could here the guys waiting outside shouting how long are you going to be, she had a little chuckle to herself and continued to enjoy the very hot shower, wasnt long before the news got out and a few other ladies were doing the same thing. Cant have the men enjoying themselves too much can we, ha,ha,       
Some serious hills today, light headwinds with a 22c max temp. For those unfamiliar with Western Australia the country roads here have no shops and very few homes along the way. You will often go miles without seeing a car.  We, together with Mary, Wendy & Pat decided to take a detour to the Treetop Walk. This is a suspension walkway built high into the tree tops of the Tingle Wood forest. Tingle Wood is a unique tree to these parts that grow tall with a wide girth.  The walkway allows tourists to enjoy viewing the forest without harming it. To reach the Tree Top Walk we added about 14 Klm to our ride. What we did not know (till we got there) was that the extra ride was all uphill and very very serious uphill. It left us feeling extremely tired very testing for us all. By the time we got to the top we were totally stuffed to say the least, and there was worse to come, we thought we would be okay with a nice cuppa and a bite to eat,(wrong). They don't sell food at the visitors centre, luckily for us Wendy, Pat and Mary came prepared a cracker biscuit, oysters and salmon went down very nicely, and for sweet Mary had a large block of Dove Hazelnut chocolate yum,yum, we needed the energy, ha,ha,. Tonight we are camping on the local sports oval. For such a small community the sports facility for the town folk is very good. Our evening meal is in the gymnasium. The place looks quite new and is a credit to the people of Walpole. One of the things we enjoy about this ride and particularly about the evening meal is the chance to sit with like minded people and discuss the days activities. Of course after a glass or two of wine the stories get better, the cycling gets faster and the hills even bigger, but this jovial conversation is not to be missed.     
This part of WA was perhaps the last to be explored and settled. Dutch , French and British explorers in turn seldom approached the complex rocky shores in high seas to chart these coasts. The first to penetrate many areas were whalers and sealers of various nationalities, who had little need to make records.  Not until the late 1830s did Preston and Clark chart the area. This town has an Ecco Walk path almost in the center of Town. The path is well maintained and leads through some native bush area. There are signs along the route that identify the various flora to be seen. The visitors centre has head-sets for a small hire fee discribing the local forna and flora. As we wander around the little town looking for the elusive "nice thing to buy" Trish spots a porcelain container at the Glass Shop. It has a Fairy on the top and is very delicate and pretty.Instantly Trish identifies it as the only thing that can house a 5 3/4 year old girls tooth. Our granddaughter Ailish is loosing teeth as her second set pop through. Such a container is obviously mandatory to any Nan worth calling a Nan so it is purchased. Phill secretly wonders if it will ever make it home without breaking but he's only a guy and obviously is not in the know about these things. Ailish loved the new container and it has been the recipient of a couple of teeth already.    This is just a spot full of beauty some parts that we had never seen let alone heard of (Williams Beach to be one of them) such a pretty place and the scenery is actually breathtaking.   
The boat is operated by the most enthusiastic man we have had the pleasure to meet in a long time. His knowledge of local History and the Environment is incredible. His ancestors services the passing whaling ships with fresh food and water. He has photographs and news clippings to show and tell. He quotes news paper reports, poetry, and anything topical you might remotely think of. His boat takes us to the "hidden" river outlet. He describes it as hidden because it took us a torturous path around sand banks to find our way out into the open sea.   . We enjoy an afternoon tea on a landing jetty within the estuary then we walked over the hill onto the beach. Waves roll in as we stand on white sand, restricted to just a few visitors (this is a National Park and has no access)     Going back in the opposite direction gives you a different perspective on life.  Not only so you see things from the other side but hills have opposite effects. Those horrible ups become glorious downs and (unfortunately) vice versa. A strange phenomina occurs to all cyclist we think, no matter what direction the bike is pointing in the wind is opposite.    On the way back to Denmark which was a reasonable ride we decided to stop of at our friends winery http://www.jindicreek.com.au we thought it was only a couple of klm's up the hill but how wrong we were it was a couple of klm up a gravel road and then further some more and some more and some more, we were totally stuffed to say the least when we arrived. Was worth the trip the welcome and the service we got was second to none, the wine was superb and the hospitality and food was great.  If you are every down Denmark this is the place to go. Ask for Rose & Mick tell them that we sent you.   
The ride was pleasantly not too bad at all. The road up to Mount Barker was rolling along but steadily rising. We came up to a popular wine yard (Trish's favorite drop) and had to call in. It looked like half the tour group had the same idea with lots of the produce being sampled. We sat in the manicured gardens and enjoyed the ambience with our friends. Alas they there plotting something and we where not to be included. We where politely asked to . We where politly asked to move on.    One of the traditions of the CTA ride is the last night concert. The concern is just any of the group getting up on stage and performing. There may be a song, a joke or even a Belly Dancer. Our friend planned something and we where not to find out until tonight. We moved on towards Mount Barker and soon found a problem, the bush was on fire, lots of smoke and ash drifted across the road as we cycled up a hill of a couple of miles. Flames were quite close to the road and the thick smoke made us cough as we passed by.  Unfortunately the bush is so dry here that this kind of deliberate patch burning is more desirable than a full scale out of control Bush Fire latter in the summer. We camped at the same site as day two and even had a hot shower. We ate our evening meal at the local hall again but we didn't linger to ensure there was enough time for all the volunteered acts to get on stage.  Singing, comedy, dancing, and even a bagpiper entertained us. The evening progressed and soon our friends there on stage to perform a Naming type Christening for our Tandem (about 9 months old). Earlier in the week we had told the girls that our Tandem was to be named Lilly from Trish's middle name, but they suggested it should also has Phil's middle name. Hence Lilly J Jnr was officially welcomed into the world with a song and blessing. Our rector the Revered Ever-ready called on the "Great Wheel Builder" in the sky to ensure Lilly J Jnr has tail winds, straight roads, down hills, and fresh air in her tyres for her long life on the open road. It was a lot of fun and the girls had written and sang a song that was pretty good. Don't think they should give up their day jobs though. A really good night had by all with lots of fun.     
  The ride home in the ute was so uncomfortable. It was in the mid 30's and the ute has no air conditioning. It was great to get into our own bed that night. Now we get serious about time on the saddle. 
The Characters: Kevin Rodger and Tom Jolliffe both cycle actively around their home base of London, Ontario, Canada. Both "gentlemen" are members of the London Cycle Club. Kevin is the young fellow, at 43 years of age (although this is constantly fluctuating), while Tom is a ripe 50 years old (I think). Since teaming up last year for a cycle trip from Frankfurt to Munich along the infamous Romantische Strasse, we have been very resourceful in planning cycling vacations, probably adding a lot of consternation to our wives' lives in the process. We usually plan one week long cycling trip per year into our hectic schedules - soon to come: Vienna, Austria to Budapest along the Danube (subject to approval from the holders of our purse strings), or another try at the Canadian Rockies. Originally, Tom and I had planned to cycle through the Canadian Rockies from Jasper to Banff at the end of June 2000. However, a scheduling conflict precluded that trip. Tom and I quickly sought an alternate destination that would fit into my vacation period at the end of May (it snows in the Rockies in May, that is why we didn't go there during this vacation period). We didn't have much time, as we still had to obtain airline tickets for Tom. We finally settled on England because of the availability of flights, and because of an itinerary we had seen in the book "Europe by Bike," by Karen and Terry Whitehill.  We would arrive in England on May 27 and depart June 5. This allowed for a day to travel to Oxford, seven days of cycling, and a day to see a few sights in London. As you can see by our web pages, things changed, and flexibility was a must. We altered our schedule somewhat so we could further enjoy some sightseeing. As a result, most of our cycling ended in Salisbury. We did, however have the opportunity to cycle directly into Heathrow Airport, where we left our bikes at left luggage for two days while we gallivanted around London. I must give credit to my riding partner, Tom Jolliffe for providing most of the written input into these web pages. Tom, even though he is much, much older than I am, seems to have an impecable memory. The detail he provided was invaluable in setting up this web page. Maps: I thought it might be appropriate to mention my thoughts about maps. Prior to leaving our hometown of London, Canada, Tom and I obtained the most detailed map we could find, a 1:250,000 scale map of south west England by Collins. We were able to find this map at the bookshop located upstairs in Novaks, an outdoor outfitter located in downtown London (Canada). This is the only map we used for the entire trip. While it proved satisfactory, I highly recommend abiding by the Whitehall's suggestion in their book: "If you haven't purchased a map with good detail up to now, do it before you leave Bath. Even a 1:50,000 map won't be overkill for this stretch of cycling. Your pence will be well spent." We actually tried to purchase the Ordnance Survey maps while in England, but every time, without exception, the map we required was always out of stock. By going to this web site, you can pre-order any maps you might require.   
We called our friends, Sharon and Ray, in Egham and they graciously encouraged us to come to their house and start our cycling trip from Egham. A good plan, visit with Sharon and Ray and then cycle to Oxford instead of taking the train.  We hailed a cab. "You want to go where? ...with two bikes? Will this be a cash fare?" Tom hesitatingly replied, "Yes." "50 quid!" was the response. We couldn't believe our luck! Only five minutes out of the Heathrow Airport, and our first chance to get ripped off! The hack driver's response was that it would take him out of the cue, and nothing less would be worth his while. Besides, nobody else was going to do it. We were somewhat distressed at the prospect of spending the equivalent of $115 Canadian to travel the less than 10 kilometers to Egham. Cycling to Egham would be easy except we did not have a detailed map of the area and so had no idea how to get to there, and we were also very hesitant about cycling out of the airport. So we agreed to the rip-off and were in Egham at Sharon and Ray's house within 30 minutes.  Sharon and Ray had recently moved from our hometown of London Ontario to England. They were members of our local cycling club and so it was very exciting to reconnect with them and to catch up our their new experiences in England. After coffee and gossip we donned our cycling gear, assembled our bikes, loaded our panniers and the four of us headed off to Windsor.  We connected to a cycling route from London to Oxford and soon entered the gated Windsor Great Park. This large park houses both the Queen Mother's residence and Windsor Castle. Enroute we passed a very impressive tree-lined promenade that extended for a mile through the park toward Windsor Castle.  We entered Windsor then stopped to view Windsor Castle. After a few photos we were on our way to Eton where we said our good-byes to our "British" hosts. Many thanks to Sharon and Ray forgetting us on our way toward Oxford.  We cycled west out of Eton, through Eton Wick and joined the A4 east of Maidenhead. Billowing clouds grew dark and drizzle soon accompanied us to Maidenhead. Drizzle strengthened to rain and by the time we arrived in Maidenhead, to hail. We waited for two brief hailstorms to pass, then headed on the A4 toward Reading. We encountered very heavy traffic on the narrow A4. The roads were in very good condition, but there was no shoulder on the A4. The terrain for the better part of the day was what I would call gently rolling with no major hills. Heavy rain soon returned and did not abate. After parking under a tree for some shelter from the driving rain, we weighed our options. Two very wet and cold cyclists determined that Oxford was not in our reach today.  We turned off at the next road into the town of Twyford. Here we stopped at a very "proper" Bed and Breakfast. A nice looking gentleman answered our knock at the door only to inform us that there was no room at the inn (I think his reaction might have had something to do with our overly wet demeanor). In any case, a quick call to another B & B secured us accomodation for the night.  After backtracking for 5 kilometers to arrive at Kiln Green we were greeted by Mary Berry and her dog, Charlie. Once dried out, somewhat to our surprise, Mary asked us to accompany her to The Old Devil Inn, a local pub located just across the street. Once there, Mary and Charlie joined two other B&B patrons. Kevin and I ordered some beers and proceeded to have a great time chatting with Mary and her two mates. More beers followed, but we were no match for Mary's gin and tonics and her mates' multiple rounds of Tangle Foot beer. With a few suds, some fish and chips, and very little sleep on the previous night's flight and the effects of jet lag taking hold, we retired early.       
After a short stint on the A4 we turned onto a "B" road through Wargrave and then joined the A321, following the Thames River valley to Henley-on-Thames. Some rowers were on the river, but there was certainly no regatta for our viewing. We continued west on the A321 until we joined the B480, which lead to Oxford.  The B480 was a quiet country road with a gradual rise through a picturesque valley. We continued to face a stiff headwind and now, for the first time, we were cycling up a long hill, appropriately named Pishill. How could we resist - we turned back and took our obligatory photo in front of this now famous sign.  The hill steepened for the last kilometer and then once at the top, it was downhill the rest of the way into Oxford, about 25 kilometers away. We restored our energy with some lunch, then continued to cycle the B480 to arrive in Oxford about 3:30 p.m. A visit to the crowded Tourist Information booth and our lodgings were easily arranged at a not-so-nearby hotel: The Hawkwell House Hotel. This hotel, located at Church Way, Iffley, Oxfordshire OX4 4DZ was offering a special rate for the night of only 40 pounds, including breakfast in the morning. Once checked in and shed of our sweaty spandex, we were ready to tour Oxford by 5:00.  Our late start and lengthy time to check-in left us little time to view Oxford. We ambled through some colleges and marveled at their detailed, intricate architecture. We walked into the New College courtyard and were politely, but sternly, ushered out by a proctor. We passed under Oxford's version of the Venice's Bridge of Sighs, then paused to view Edmund Halley's former observatory. We continued to stroll about the university town. We regretted our short stay in Oxford and wished we had additional time to learn some of Oxford's history.        
Crossing the A415, we found our way to a series of confusing and unsigned country lanes that wound their way through Yelford and Ashton where we rejoined the B4449. Then we made our way through the beautiful village of Bampton with its many picturesque cottages. We left the B4449 for the B4477 and made a rest stop at the "The Vines" in Black Bourton. The cost for lunch was a reasonable 4 pounds.  Continuing west on the B4477 through Alvescot, Kencott and Broughton Boggs, we crossed the A361. From here we found more quiet gently rolling country lanes. Kevin and I missed some turns in this section and ended up tacking our way towards the A417 just east of Cirencester. A short cycle on the A417, and we were at the Tourist Information booth to book our B&B for the night. This night we stayed at the Leauses, 101 Victoria Road, Cirencester. The cost was 40 pounds for the both of us,and of course that price included the standard "full English breakfast." You guessed it: one fried egg, sausage, bacon, and cold toast.  Cirencester was the centre of the medieval wool trade, and is sometimes referred to as the "Capital of the Cotswolds." Nineteen hundred years ago Cirencester was second only to London in importance and size. At one time it was also populated by the Romans, and it has many ruins from this period. We wandered the town to view the cathedral and some Roman ruins, then headed to the pub for refreshments. Just outside of the pub several young brits made fun of the fact that Kevin was wearing shorts.  The temperature was of course a bit on the cool side, but you get used to that when you live in Canada. We Canadians were too early for dinner, as usual, so we settled for beers until the pub dinner hour arrived around 6:30 p.m.. Beer was always very appreciated after several hours in the saddle. After a couple of hours of drinking beer and chips we departed for our night's accommodations. Before we made it to the B & B, we did summon the strength to stop by another pub for a drink.   
We found it interesting to see phone booths located on quiet country roads - perhaps a throwback to the days when not everyone had their own phones. Upon entering Malmesbury Kevin experienced his one and only flat of the trip (at least while riding). We stopped, changed the tube and then walked 50 yards to a very conveniently located gas station to pump up the tire. We took advantage of the air pump and topped up our tires. At this point, Kevin noticed that my rear tire was feathering in several locations. I had neglected to inspect my tires prior to departure and this oversight in basic bicycle maintenance would come back to bite me. After leaving Malmesbury we ventured back into another maze of country roads heading for Castle Combe. After several quick map referencing stops we cycled under the busy M4 motorway and had our lunch break just outside of Castle Combe.  The Cotswold village of Castle Combe lies at the bottom of a steep sided valley. This quaint "wool" town has gained stature as the "prettiest village in England." We toured the village, inspected the church graveyard (which appears quite haunted due to the tombstones, which appear ready to fall over), admired the hotel grounds and crossed the quaint stone bridge. Now the hard part - cycle out of Castle Combe.  With a steady pace we tackled the tree-lined valley wall and in a few minutes emerged from the valley. Now we were once again on our way to Bath. The gently rolling countryside of the Thames River valley was now behind us. Hills grew larger and steeper. We crossed the A420 at The Shoe and the upcoming hill did Tomin. Half way up he dismounted and walked up the remainder of the steep incline. Out of sympathy (or so he said), Kevin also dismounted. It was the only hill in England where he did this, finding out it was just as easy to slowly grind up in his lowest gear. After a few more kilometers we made an exhilarating descent into Batheaston. Kevin reached a top speed of 70 kph, whereas I gave my brakes a workout and descended at a slower speed. We now joined the heavy Bath traffic and cycled our way into the centre of Bath. Once cleaned up at our B&B (Avoca, 16 Newbridge Road, Bath BA1 3JX), we toured some of the Bath sites: the Royal Crescent, The Circus, Pultenay Bridge and the Roman Baths.  I had arranged to meet with a couple from Bristol, Ela and Jitu in the evening. Ela and Jitu had been visiting with their family in London Ontario for Christmas and it was great to reconnect with them. We had a very enjoyable, but much too short visit in the Abbey Courtyard.       
Wonderful cycling along lanes with the high hedgerows and no traffic was a real treat for us today. We cycled through Paulton, Midsomer Norton and Chilcompton then found the B3139 that lead to Wells. A long coasting descent took us into Wells. After our lunch break we toured the Wells Cathedral.  Outside, we met with some other cyclists who were also headed to Glastonbury. A large group of 30 cyclists on tandem bicycles were out for a two-day trip culminating in a rendezvous in Glastonbury. This was our only time on our trip we met a group ofcyclists.  We quickly left Wells for the short trip to Glastonbury, hoping to make it into town before all accommodation was taken up by the other cyclists. Sunny weather gaveway to clouds and by the time we reached Glastonbury there were a few brief sprinkles. After booking into The Old Bakery Bed and Breakfast, located at 84A Bove Town, Kevin toured the Tor, while Tom remained behind at the B&B to nurse the beginning of a cold.  Before the end of the last century the White Spring flowed from out of a cave within a small combe orvale at the foot of Glastonbury Tor. Its sister spring, Chalice Well or the Blood Spring, lies a few yardsaway on the other side of Well House Lane.  The grotto around the White Spring was originally overhung by trees and was full of shade and moisture-loving plants. It was a popular local picnic spot. Where the spring emerged, accretions of white calcite (calcium carbonate) built up on the exposed limestone and upon any twigs or branches which lay in the water, giving rise to the name. It is also known as the Tor Spring. Beside the White Spring an offshoot of Chalice Well water emerged and stained the stones in that part of the combe a dark red.  Unlike the Chalice Well the water of the White Spring has very little iron content and an irregular rate of flow. This can vary from 500 to 50,000 gallons per day. The source of the water is unknown but it must pass through the limestone beds which underlie this part of Somerset for a fair length of time before being pushed upwardas a result of artesian pressure below Glastonbury Tor. Here it is diverted by the hard Midford Sandstone of the summit and flows laterally through the softer layers of blue limestone and marl to emerge at the White Spring. No doubt the water has created caverns and flowstone formation below the Tor, access to which may once have even been possible.  The tradition of the White Spring is that it forms the entrance to and the exit from the pagan Underworld, the Celtic Annwn. The colours and the creatures of Annwn are traditionally red and White. The entrance is guarded by Gwynn ap Nudd "white son of night" Lord of the Underworld and King of Faery. Glastonbury legend says Gwynn and his fairies were exorcised by St Collen in the 6th century. Having one artesian spring into which has leached a distinctly coloured mineral is unusual enough, but to have two quite differently coloured springs rising side by side means that not only in fiction but in fact Glastonbury Tor lies over a mysterious subterranean realm! The colours red and white have further symbolic resonance in the British mythological tradition.  From "The Red and White Springs: The Mysteries of Britain at Glastonbury" by NICHOLAS R. MANN.  After Kevin's return we ventured out to tour the town. Glastonbury appears to host a rather eclectic group of artisans and hippies. This was much different to the throngs of camera clad tourists that we had become accustomed to and identified with. A pub dinner with several beers preceded our return to the B&B.         
In no time at all, we were off our intended course. After about 15 kilometers of cycling on flat country lanes we found ourselves about 7 or 8 kilometers off course. We joined the A361 to the A371 and endured the heavy traffic until the B3081.  Flat countryside was again behind us - we weren't especially fond of what we saw in our path. We made several climbs and an especially long climb prior to Bruton and then a quick descent into the town. We continued on the B3081 and more tough climbs. We cycled parallel to the A303 to take advantage of a more gradual incline. We joined the B3092, cycled under the A303 and headed into Mere for our lunch stop. From Mere we cycled into another maze of country roads towards the A350 and East Knoyle. After crossing the A350 we tried to plan our route to avoid another large hill. But no luck, we missed a valley route and instead climbed yet again before descending into Tisbury. From here to Salisbury the countryside was much flatter. We joined heavy traffic on the B3089. A strong tailwind helped us quicken our pace to 35 Kph all the way to Wilton.  At Wilton Tom stopped to get some cold medication. While in the drug store Tom's feathered rear tire gave way with a loud boom. This was actually a humourous experience for Kevin. Just as the "explosion" occurred, several young teenagers were walking by.  Not only did the blast scare the living daylights out of them, but Kevin initially thought they were playing a gag on him by exploding firecrackers nearby.  Ironically, the teens had just bought a tire repair kit from a local store and offered to help. The rear tire was a write-off. Fortunately, Kevin had some tire repair tape that he used to line the feathered sections inside the tire - it was deemed that five sections of tire needed the repair tape. The temporary fix held for the remaining 10 Km into Salisbury.  With a late start, a long ride and a flat tire we just made the Tourist Information Office 5 minutes before closing at 6PM. The office clerk seemed to take pity on this sniffling tourist and after several calls helped book a B&B. It was 7PM by the time we had checked-in and were ready for dinner. There was much to see in Salisbury, we decided to forgo the next day's cycle to Winchester and stay two nights in Salisbury. We walked downtown for dinner, and along the way we met another cyclist asking for directions.  We were actually able to help him out, as he was staying at the same bed and breakfast as ourselves.  He was quite grateful for our help, as he had over-extended himself that day by cycling over 120 km into headwinds.  We continued on our way to the downtown area where we strolled into a pub to sample yet another beer. Two young chaps noted our accent and stuck up a conversation with us. These two chaps were well primed with beer and kept us entertained while one called his Uncle "Knobby" on his cell phone. "Talk to Uncle Knobby, he lives in Canada too," the inebriated, but jovial lad said.  After talking tohis uncle for a few minutes we found out he lived only 45 minutes away from our homes, in the village of Strathroy. We greatly enjoyed the banter and often thought of how these two fellows must have coped the next day.  The next day we made our decision to stay longer in Salisbury.  Tom's cold had worsened by now, and we needed any excuse to get in some additional sightseeing,as well as beer drinking.  Unfortunately, our bed and breakfast for the first night, the Holmhurst Guest House was fully booked.  Karen Hayward, the proprietor was kind enough to call a friend on the other side of Salisbury, and we were quickly booked and on our way to the Old Rectory Bed and Breakfast for another fun filledday.    During our second day in Salisbury, we decided to take a quick bus trip to the legendary Stonehenge.  While this grouping of ancient monoliths had always held a special interest with us, once we arrived we found it a bit of an anticlimax.  The site was fairly small and not totally awe inspiring.  Admission to the site includes the use of a digital audio guide.  The use of this piece of equipment does provide some insight into the stones at Stonehenge, and I highly recommend its use to get some return for the high price of admission.     
I copied freehand from a detailed map at the train station of the Heathrow area. It did not look too complicated.  We were off to an early start for the big city after stowing our bikes in the small bike area on board the train.  There really was not enough room to stow both bikes in the one stall, so Tom sat his in the passageway and kept close tabs on it so it did not impede anyone.  We switched trains part way to London for the short journey to Hounslow Station.  In Hounslow, we started our ride towards Heathrow by following signs, our rough sketch, and a passenger van that had "Heathrow Express" written on the side.  Somewhere along the way we got ... well - lost again.  We stopped at a bike shop for directions, and we were promptly on our way once again.  Traffic into Heathrow on this Saturday was not as busy as I expected.  Most cars respected our space, except for one that Tom accidentally cut off while entering a large, confusing round-about.  Part way along we came to a cycle path and things were good.  We rode, and rode, and rode.  We seemed to be going in one big long circle around the entire airport!  Eventually our bike path ended at an underground tunnel.  What were we to do now - I didn't relish cycling through with a throng of cars behind.  Upon closer inspection of the tunnel, there was a silhouette of a bike painted on the pavement, and an accompanying sign that said cyclists have priority in the tunnel.  I was quickly off.  With the noise deafening (it sounded like a prairie freight train five feet behind), I rode at the breakneck speed of 40 kph through the tunnel.  Arriving at the other side I waited for Tom's arrival.  And waited...  He appeared after about five minutes.  Tom had not seen me enter the tunnel, and took a bit longer to get his nerve up and take the plunge.  After leaving our bikes at the left luggage area of Terminal 3 in Heathrow Airport, we caught an underground train for downtown London.  Because Saturday was an extra day in London, we had not prebooked a hotel, and the Hotel we were staying in on Sunday (Regent Palace) was fully booked.  We opted for a more expensive sister hotel a couple blocks away.  This was a worthwhile extra expense, as we both enjoyed the privacy of our own bathroom for the one night stay. While in London, we enjoyed doing the usual "tourist" things, such as touring the Tower of London (Kevin's third time through), and evening pub crawls, and ghost tours. Monday morning came, and we realised our vacation was over - we made our way back to Heathrow Airport, collected our bikes and proceeded to check in.  Tom was most gratified when they upgraded us to business class.  On the way over to England, we were "crammed" into the centre isle of a 767, and Tom (being fairly tall) managed to spill no less than three drinks on the gentleman seated next to him.  It was hard for Tom to repeat this in the upper deck of the 747 400 series, as the next passenger was a good 12 inches from his side!

Although it took me less than six weeks to complete this trip, it's taking me much longer to sit down and try to describe. As more and more time passes from my trip it's more difficult to put down the events that occurred to me during this 6 weeks of travel. The inspiration to write down what I've done came to me as I've found this nice site maintained by Neil Gunton. It was his writing and the writings of others that encouraged me to put down my story as well. Otherwise I would be procrastinating even more, as I was planning to have my own WEB site to publish the memories of my trip. The next few sections give in more details about the planning, the selection of the equipment and some of the resources that I've used to plan my trip. I would like also take the opportunity to introduce the rest of my family. My wife, daughter and the cat(s). My role at home in addition to cycling among others is also to take care of the cats, water and hang the plants.           
When I've started thinking seriously about my trip I've purchased and read in the winter 1999/2000 some bike books talking about long distance bicycle touring and read some stories of long distance touring on the WEB. I've also written to all the pedestrian/bicycle coordinators in each of the states that I was planning to cross and requested as detailed map of each state as possible. I got the maps from all the states that I've requested. While not all of the maps were too detailed they suffice to plan my route. In addition I've also purchased from Adventure Cycling association their Southern Tier Maps.  My thought was to select as simple route as possible between the starting point and the end point of my trip. Since the Adventure Cycling maps already cover most of the route to be covered, I had to plan the remaining pieces of the puzzle. Which were the initial and the final phases of my trip. The plan was to go SouthEast and later connect with Adventure Cycling route somewhere around Phoenix, AZ. Originally I planned to go west through Mount Hamilton (the home of the Lick Observatory), continue through Yosemite than south on route 395 through Bishop. What caused to change my mind were the reports I've read on the CA State Parks site about bears in Yosemite being very active that year. Therefore to simplify the matter I've decided to take another route, one which will take me South through Gilroy, Pinnacles National Monument, Coalinga, Bakersfield and Mojave.  Also comparing the Adventure Cycling maps with the state maps, I've noticed that their route was passing through routes less traveled. This of course would add somewhat to my mileage, but I was interested to finish the trip ASAP. Therefore when I could use a straightforward route to go from point A to point B, I would select it instead. This did not prove to be a wise choice in some instances, as we'll see later. The last section of my trip in Florida, I've planned as I went along, just by looking at the Florida State map, which was quite detailed and had other good information as well. 
My preparation included daily commute to work, a distance of about 26 miles with my panniers loaded. I was riding to work with my front pannniers full of one gallon water bottel on each side. The rear panniers were always loaded with my books, clothing to change, including shoes as well as my lunch and sometimes breakfast. In addition to this I've made at least three , 2 day trips fully (almost fully) loaded in the area. The disatnce was for the 2 days of about 200 miles. These trips proved that it's not as easy to travel fully loaded especially in a heat and uphill. I've carried with me the camping equipment as well as some food and extra clothing. but it was nothing close to what I've palnned to take for the cross country trip. These trips taught me how to set up my tent in the darkness as well as how to use my stove. When the spring of 2000 approached, the pace of the work in my company also has picked up and I did not feel that it would be the appropriate time to take off. So I've decided to wait few months untill the fall of 2000.

 You can also see the reflective strips on the wheels for extra visibility at night.  is of my bicycle while still being on my workstand the day of my departure, Sept. 13th 2000  taken in the morning. It was in this postion for a few days while I was working on the packing and making sure it's in sound mechanical shape. You can imagine yourself the comments I was getting from my wife with the bike standing in the middle of the living room! for all the time I was loading. I certainly greatly appreciate her patience and cooperation. Here are some details on the bicycle and the equipment attached to it: 1. Frame Merlin http://www.merlinbike.com/ Titanium a 1994 model.  2. Equipment Shimano XTR components, groupo year 1994.  3. Handlebars equipped with "Nuke" drop down and extension bar. They used to advertise in "Adventure Cycling" magazine. I can not say that it's a too great product. The drop down I've used was the "L" type. Maybe their other version of the classical dropdown would be better.  4. Bontrager rims with Continental http://www.conti-online.com/ Top Touring 2000 tires.  5. Front gearing 26/36/46 chainrings.  6. Rear gearing, of 13 through 28. 8 speed. 7. Jandd Mountaineering http://www.jandd.com/ expedition bike rack.  8. Old Man Mountain http://www.oldmanmountain.com/ front rack.  9. Zeffal fenders and home made flaps with extra reflectors.  10. Union generator set, this was my workhorse for the night cycling as well as on the longer days. The days were getting shorter and shorter and to cover more distance I had to extend my cycling into the night more and more. NOTE: It adds some drag to the tire therefore it slows you down a bit. This is one of the sites that carry it: http://catalog.bicycleblowout.com/site/intro.cfm?PageID=37&Category=82 I've seen at http://www.harriscyclery.com/ that there is a Shimano brand that comes mounted in a hub and has very low drag.  11. Two red Vista flashing taillights and one white for front. In the desert in the middle of the night this was actually enough to light the road in front of me.  12. Terry Men's Fly Bicycle Saddle. 13. Three water bottle cages, one for the stove fuel and two for water. Spare spokes (x6) and Blackburn compact pump. 14. Rhode Gear rear view panoramic mirror. I think it's a must on a cross-country trip. 15. An Avocet 50 Altimeter (not available anymore). I had it for over 9 years and needed to repair it once. They still keep the PDF version of the manual on line at: http://www.avocet.com/instrpdfs/50Eng.pdf/

Before departing on my trip, I've left an approximate itinerary of my trip with my wife at home. I've left my home at exactly 2:00 PM what looked to be a nice and warm day. The trip was relatively easy as I knew the route, but I forgot that I'd hit the relentless afternoon rush hour in the heart of Silicon Valley. After negotiating the street traffic and the numerous turns to take me out of the city I've reached Monterey Highway which took me South to Gilroy. Gilroy for those who may not know is famous for it's garlic. It's very well known here in the Silicon Valley area during the "Gilroy Garlic Festival" that takes place for 3 days during the month of July. It's very hot there but if you like garlic and want to sample some of the culinary achevements made out of it it's worth the trip. You can eat there anything from roasted garlic through garlisc pie to garlic ice cream. Anything garlic goes there ! On my trip South I've been passing many motorists stacked in traffic and have been wandering that they must be happy finally making it closer to home. While I was thinking that it's only the beginning for me to the relatively unknown road in front of me. Around 7:00 PM I've reached the city of Gilroy and stopped by a local Pizzeria for a big slice of pizza and some drink. While there I've asked the owner for a cheap Motel in the area and he recommended Motel 6 saying that they are cheap, around $60. This was too steep a price for me so I went to look for something less expensive, read further. I've  continued until I hit a quite road and found that it was passing near a nursery. I've circled the place and decided that it's peaceful enough to pitch a tenth in the area. I've crossed a field and parked my bike near the fence beyond the nursery so nobody could see me. Behind me was a dry creek so it felt relatively safe and only in distance I could see some lights from houses as well hear dogs barking. I hoped that nobody is going to explore the area where I was situated. The next picture shows the setup as photographed early morning the next day.   
I've washed myself using a towel dipped in water and cooked my oats and ate a power bar. Around 8:00 AM I was on my way toward Coalinga. I've started south on Hwy 25 and later on merged to Hwy. 198 leading to Coalinga. I'm quite familiar with this route as it's also the route of one of the local centuries (currently discontinued) called the Gilroy Garlic Festival century. As I was passing the main street of Hollister, a quiet and neat town on Hwy. 25 I could smell the smell of fresh muffins and donuts. So I stopped at a local bakery for some cakes, juice and coffee. This enrgized me for the rest of the day which turned out to be more difficult than I could imagine earlier. There was not much traffic going my way and the wheather was perfect. The only problem that concerned me was my bicycle wiggling or oscilating when I tried to get up from my saddle or to accelarate. You can judge for yourself on the condition of the traffic on my route from the following picture.    Since I felt relatively good I decided to skip the camp site I know is available at the Pinnacles National Monument site, just of Highway 25. It takes few miles deviation to go inside but I decided to continue in hope that I'll find a place to sleep somewhere along the way.  Once I've decided to continue and knowing there are no services until Coalinga, I've stopped at the California Department of Forestry fire station and filled-up all my reservouirs with water. The firefighters that saw me with all my gear were quite impressed and showed me to their kithchen  where I also ate light dinner consuming couple of my power bars. Theys also told me that I'm lucky to find them here as the station is seasonal and is closed after October.   As I continued I've noticed that it was getting dark very fast, because the mountains were on my right side and the sun was already hiding. After passing the entrence to the Pinnacles National Monumnet there were few small climbs and nice descents on Hwy 25. It became already completely dark and I entered unfamiliar terittory. The route winded and climbed more, winded even more and climbed and I was getting very tired with all my equipment. I've started to look around if there is any place to pitch a tent but it was all mountain slope going down. At ceratin point I've decided that I'll walk as it was realy hard to pedal up. I've probably walked for a mile or so to a place that looked like a peak to me. I did not want to continue since it was very foggy, I could see how my lights were reflcting back from the fog. I looked around but it was all fenced area. I found what looked like an opening in the fence but I was too tired to carry the bike through. It was also late, close to 11:30 PM, suddenly I've spotted a small hill with a big Oak tree on top of it. So I climbed there and decided to retire. But I was also very hungry at the same time so I've preapared the fast meal from a freeze dry food from REI. Just add boiling water, wait few minutes and ready to it.  It looked dry under the tree and I did not pitch my tenth. I was a bit worried as I foudn some human garbage in the area, namely bottles and something that looked like hunting knife holder. However I took the chance and fell a sleep very fast. 
I was awaken early in the morning by the water dripping on me from the Oak tree, that was probably the result of the condensation on the leafs. I've cooked some oats ate a power bar and drank some coffee as well. Very soon I found myself going downhill on a very nice descend. So my guess last night that I've reached some peak was correct. The sun starting to break through the fog and road became dry soon. It was a bit winding but I could go quite fast as the traffic was again very sparse. Actually I've seen only one tractor going up with some workers, but other than that nothing else. The series of picture here were taken shortly after I've finished the descent and entered the area around Priest Valley, which as far as I could see had only few houses. The place is marked on the California map but if you go to Yahoo/Maps you'll not find it, strange          The Valley was very nice and peaceful. Just a perfect begining for a long cycling day. A cattle was on the pastures on both sides of the road. The bulls started to run as soon as they saw me and what is strange they were running in the same direction I was going. Luckily a fence at the end of the field stopped them, since I've started to worry a bit already. My plan for that day was to send home some of the stuff that I carried and that deemed not needed for the rest of the trip or stuff that I could give up. Some of the items I've sent back were needed later on, especially the warm clothing. In any event as soon as I've reached Coalinga I looked for a US Post Office. Coalinga appeared to be much bigger and nicer town that I've imagined. Among others I've sent back the handlebar bag, the Silca floor pump, some of the warm clothing, my "Teva" sandals (having size 13 shoes, this was some weight saving as well) and the micro-cassette recorder (I wish I did not). This obviously reduced my total weight by few pounds. However it did not eliminate the wiggling or oscillations completely. I continued South on Hwy 33 and on my way stopped in a local restaurant and ate a good sandwich for lunch at a local restaurant. Also I've filled all my four water bottles and the hydration pack with water. This was a good idea as it became hotter and there was no water until the town of McKittrick. That time of the year was apparently a harvest time for nuts in Southern California and therefore there were many trucks passing on the road. When they passed me I was blown back and forth making my progress more and more difficult and I became covered with dust. Not all the drivers slowed down or made sure they keep safe distance when passing me. The road was also quite narrow and rough. Along the road I've seen many nuts trees. Among them I've also seen Pistachios trees, which I've learned grow on trees and not on bushes like peanuts (this what I thought). From a distance and in the late afternoon sun they looked to me like some kind of grapes. This picture shows some of the Pistachios trees I've seen on my way.    And more Pistachios trees.    In addition to the nice pictures of the Pistachios there was a lovely smell of roasted nuts along the way. This was coming as I've learnt later from a huge processing plant located along the highway. The name of the consortium that owned this plant was named 'Paramount', I'm not sure if there is a relation to Hollywood. I continued my ride in to darkness and started to see area with a lot of lights and thought I'm approaching the town of McKittrick. So I continued further and have seen great deal of huge trucks and started to smell some strange smell, not too pleasant. This reminded me something of the nature of oil processing plant which I recognized from past experience. As I continued I started to see many oil pumps going up and down and trucks and more trucks, but strangely I did not see any humans. This spanned for few good miles and the smell was killing me. It reminded me some episode from a 'STAR WARS' movie. I wanted to get away from this as soon as possible but was getting exhausted and I started to look for a place to retire. I've waved to some of the trucks to ask the drier about a place to stay but none of them stopped. I was too tired to continue further and also was not sure about whare exactly I was and  McKittrick was out of site. Although from the reading of my odometer I was supposed to be around somewhere. I thought to myself that may be I've taken a wrong turn and therefore I do not see it. From the Blackwell Corner it said that it's 25 miles to McKittrick and 45 miles to Taft. My only concern now was to get some rest and configure the rest next day in the morning. So I gave up and when I thought I got far enough from the bed smell I entered a road into one of the plants and turned into the low desert bushes. They were not high enough to hide behind and the trucks entering and leaving could see me clearly. When I stopped moving and there was no noise from my generator I could suddenly hear very well an orchestrated noise from a bunch of Coyote in a distance. This made me a bit worried if this is going to be safe and if they may not get close to me. Although I was planning to lay down on a mattress in my sleeping bag only, but due to the howling of the Coyote I've decided to set my tenth. I was so tired that I fell asleep very fast and luckily no one bothered me till the morning. 
After a ride of 2 to 3 miles and some climbing I've reached the top of the hill and only now I could see the town of McKittrick in the horizon. This also explained why I could not see it yesterday night. The sign on my right said that the population of this town is only 130. As I entered the town I've noticed a school on my left side. What was strange that it was very quiet and I did not see any students outside and it looked like deserted although the gate was open. So I thought to myself that it was only Friday, but it turned out that it was Saturday and the school was closed today. In any event I've entered through the gate and found a faucet with water. Suddenly I've seen a woman exiting one of the classes and I've approached her and asked if there is any place I could take a shower here. She replied that there is none, but I've seen a pool on the other side of the lawn, so I concluded that there must be some shower or something like this. She stepped into one of the classes and after a while she emerged back and said that her husband will open the pool where the showers are located. But she said that the water may not be warm, which I did not care as I've not showered or shaved for the last 4 days. Once inside the shower area I've also laundered my bike clothing and changed, so minimum you need two pairs as not always there is a camp or make laundry anytime you wish! Later on I've stopped and a local grocery, (looks like the only one in town) and paid for a small sandwich and Gatorade $5.50. While in Coalinga for a much bigger sandwich and Gatorade I paid only $3.00, well  just money. I left Coalinga and continued East on Hwy 58 toward Bakersfield. However I've tried to avoid to pass through it.  Around 7:30 PM I've reached a small town named Panama. Since it was already dark and I did not want to continue as it looked like tomorrow will be a hilly day. I could already see the mountains in the horizon, the ones that I'll be climbing tomorrow. Along the way thre was a small church and decided to stop and look if I could spent the night over there. It was a bit remotely located from the houses and stood by itself in front of a corn field. I  went to look if there might be somone to ask if I could pitch my tenth behind the church. However it appeared that there was nobody around. So I went behind the last building near the farming fields and pitched my tenth there. This is the 1st time in few days that I was able to prepare my dinner while sitting at some picnic table. I've also repaired the flat and done some work on the bicycle that was making noise from the tailgate lamp rubbing the spokes from the panniers pressure on it. These desert place are becoming very cold at night and I've started to be sorry for shipping the fleece jacket and my Silca floor pump when I had to pump my wheel. 
  At that instant I've also heard noise like someone walking around the church and noticed that the pastor has returned (may be late at night ?) and was cleaning and rearranging stuff around. I was wondering what is the purpose of him doing all this so early in the day. When he approached me he said god morning and I replied telling him that I slept here and he said, 'Oh I may have forgotten to close one of the doors to a class.'  He did not realize that I slept outside in a tenth, which was still standing at that time. I told him that I'll be leaving in a while and he asked me where am I heading. I replied that I go to Florida and he said have a safe trip. In any event after a while I've seen guests ladies and gentleman dressed neatly arriving and gathering in one of the classes and after a while someone started playing piano and the choir sang. Well I forgot completely that it was already Sunday and hence the festive gathering. I've arranged my stuff washed and ate breakfast while the people were still singing and left the place toward Mojave in the direction of Hwy 58 but before that I had to climb the Tehachapi pass. On the left is the Sierra Nevada and on the right are the Tehachapi mountains. Somehow from the map I've configured that there must be a shortcut to Hwy 58 and I entered some secondary route that was leading me through an agricultural area. I've seen there water melons, oranges and other fruits growing. This is the heart of the famous Kern County. The climate is very hot but there is no water around. It's brought from the north through the famous California aqueducts. Well after I came closer to the mountains I realized that the route I took ended and I wanted to turn left toward Hwy 58. I met two farmer ladies and asked them if this road leads to Hwy 58, and they replied that not. As the result of this I had to retrace my way back loosing some time. After few turns I finally entered Hwy 58 and it looked very buys. It is a divided Hwy and carries great deal of traffic of al kind, including many heavy trucks. Throughout the day it became hotter and hotter as I approached the town of Tehachapi    and the Tehachapi pass. I made it to the top (almost) when the sun started to set down already. On my way up I've stopped at some restaurant along the way. It was the only ony on the climb, while the sandwich was so, so the place was nice and cool. It was a needed break before heading further to Mojave.    After the climb to the Tehachapi peak I had nice and very long descend toward Mojave. Due to the headwind that was blowing in the opposite direction the ride downhill was not as fast as I would like. There were also trucks and cars passing me all the time. The traffic was pretty heavy one and because it was already dark on the other side of the mountain I kept some bigger distance from the shoulder. I wanted to avoid any surprise hitting a pothole or another obstacle. Some of the drivers did not like it and passed quite close to me.  Mojave surprised me as quite neat looking town. From the conversation with one of the waitresses in the Pizzeria I ate my pizza dinner I was told that many of the residents are working or serving in the Edwards Air Force base. It had neat restaurants and numerous motels, but I was looking for something cheaper. I asked the waitress if she knows where a local campsite is located. She said that she does not know but said that there is a public park near the school and gave me directions. I've decided to look if I could sleep there. On my arrival I've seen few youngsters and asked them if they think I could sleep in the park they said that they've seen people sleeping there. Since it was already after 10:00 PM I've decided that I'll pitch there. There were also public restrooms there with running water. The park had nice green grass and it worried me that the sprinklers might operate at night. I found a corner under some pine trees where there was not grass. After washing myself lightly in the cold water I went to sleep. 
Another interesting thing along this way was many of the retired and not used airline planes. I could read the names like TWA, NorthWestern, PanAm, Continental and some others. This looked like a graveyard of the big planes. Although recently I've heard that there were many airlines that retired early their fleet of planes due to overcapacity and underutilization. The last few miles before Barstow were very busy, as Barstow is a major hub for few highways, namely 58, interstate 15 and 40. One has to be a bit more careful when making the entrance and also not to end on one of the interstate highways. When I reached Barstow I did not look for a campsite but decided to stay in a Motel and sleep during the day do some maintenance on my bike as well as my body. My butt suffered from a bad boil and also had to plan my trip ahead. Namely how many more sections shall I do in California as well as what would be my route to Arizona. It actually changed later on the spot from an advice I got from a local. I've stayed in Barstow the next night and the day resting and taking care of business. I did not go sightseeing but watched some TV when not sleeping and doing other stuff. The Motel I've stayed is called Desert Inn and paid $22 for night. 
The day was devoted mostly to some rest, maintenance of my bike and of my body as well as planning of the next segment of my trip. This was not planned clearly before my departure and I was planning to take care of this during my trip based on the current conditions. Since the distance from Barstow to Needless California was about 150 Miles and based on my experience in the desert I was not able to make it in one shot even with some effort. This was mostly due to the heat and the limited time I could cycle. I've decided that I'll leave early Wednesday morning, actually around midnight. 
I should perhaps also add that I've left with all my water containers full. This included the 4 of the bottles, Jandd hydrator and the 1Gallon collapsible water container. The right starts with a portion on I-40. However soon on the outskirts of the town you merge into the a frontage road that goes almost parallel to I-40 and later on in Ludlow you take the 'National Trails Highway'. All this road including the last one is in very bad shape. There are big patholes and the asphalt is split in many places. As a result of this I've been going many times illegally opposite to traffic (luckily there is not much of it) on a narrow section that was just dug for putting a fiberoptics cable. This narrow section on the left-hand side of the road was well paved. This and the heat as well as the fact that I was standing on my pedals for long period of time (to avoid the bumps) were taking a toll on me. The fact that I've rested well the last day and night was a very good idea before this trip. This was a reason that I liked the idea of riding on Interstate highway as it's allowed in Arizona. But more on this will be told in the Arizona segment. Early in the morning after about 7 hours of travel, right after Ludlow I've got flat #2 of my trip. My close investigation revealed that the 'Mr.Tuffy' liner cutting into the tube caused this flat. NOTE: My experience as well as this reported by others Mr. Tuffy is not good protecting you from flats on fully loaded tours!!! I had this experience myself while commuting with Mr. Tuffy to work. But I thought that by wrapping the liner in electrical tape as well as smoothing its edges and removing the overlap, I would not get the flat. Well this has proven to be a false expectation. Therefore I got read of the Mr. Tuffy liner on my rear wheel. I repaired that flat and continued.  Along the way there was an interesting spot it's the Amboy Crater that is designated as one of the National Natural Landmarks. The next set of pictures shows the place and one of the pictures gives the fuller description of this location.          Show links to this Hide links to this          After repairing my tire and making few pictures near the Amboy crater I arrived just in time to the famous Roy's Cafe http://www.rt66roys.com/ in Amboy for a hearty and cheap breakfast. There is also a motel there but being save conscious and still feeling strong I decided to continue. This probably was a mistake since after few miles further the heat and the exhaustion caused me to start to look for a spot to take a rest. I've found some drainage spot along the road and dragged my bicycle across the desert sand and pitched my tenth. I probably took a nap for 45 minutes or so when I was awaken from the sun shining just into my tenth and causing me to perspire like a hell. This was around 11:00AM, and the temperatures did not peak yet. I gathered my stuff fast, washed myself from the sticky sweat and sand and continued along the way to Essex. When I arrived there I was told that the temperature just reached 112 F and I really was feeling like it was so at one point. This was the day that as I cycling and I saw a freight train in the distance that I thought to myself if I could only get somehow a ride on the train to my next destination. But it was only a dream. Finally I've arrived at some spot where there was an overpass under the railway tracks and decided to pitch my tenth there. As it was already late, probably after 10:00 PM I've set my tenth just near the the overpass. It was too narrow to place my tenth under the overpass. The ground there was very soft, actually white beach sand and it was an ideal place to rest on. However I've noticed that the train were passing there quite often in both directions and with every pass the wind blow was terrible and I worried that this will flip the tenth. Also I worried a bit that the train may overturn and I'll be killed. So I've dragged my tenth few feet away from the underpass toward the road and left the bicycle locked to one of the poles under the overpass. I also put earplugs into my ears and fell asleep very fast; none of the trains passing above me bothered me at all. 
I've arrived in Needles around noon with temperatures hitting again the 112 F border. I ate some tuna sandwich, drank Gatorade and Coke in a Chevron gas station convenience store. After that I cycled around until I found a decent motel, it was Motel 6 and decided to stay there for the rest of the day and evening. As usual in the desert my plan was to continue in the middle of the night whenever possible. This Motel 6 was not cheap but I could not find a cheaper place there despite the fact that there were almost no people there. I guess the proximity to the Colorado River in the middle of the desert determines the price. They charged me $40 and I was too tired to go and look for cheaper place. I cooked my meal in the room and packed my bicycle ready for the next segment of my trip and went to sleep. 
My map did not show the exact climb from Needless and it turned out to be a killer. Firstly the road was winding and the hot wind was blowing against me, making the climb much more difficult. There were also many big trucks going at night and passing me often on this route.  Originaly I planned to continue from Needles to Kingman AZ, travel on I-40 and than Hwy 93 toward Phoenix. From looking on the map it looked like it will be an easier route that the one I've made. I've changed my plan based on information I got from an owner from a tire repair workshop in Fenner, Ca the previous night. I'm not sure if this was an easier route but it definitely was not easy. In any event in the middle of the climb the front tire had a flat (#3 and before the last till the end of the trip). After taking off the tire I've again determined that it was the liner cutting into the tube. I got read of the last liner and used a spare tube to repair the flat. It was night and in the middle of the climb and trucks passing me very close so I had to hurry up. After finishing the climb the rest of Hwy 95 appeared to be peace of cake it was relatively straight. However the climb took a toll on me so I've pulled my bike toward some low lying bushes along the road around 6:00 AM and used my ground cloth, mattress and the sleeping bag to take a nap. I woke up as usual with the desert sun starting to operate and heating up the air. This was around 9:00 AM. However this short nap definitely boosted my energy level and I was able to continue to Parker Arizona. After turning east at Vidal junction and continuing on Hwy 62 I've arrived to Parker AZ in the early afternoon hours. The heat goes on as I arrive to Parker, AZ. Although it seemed to be a bit cooler that in Needles. Parker is on the eastern side of the Colorado river while Needles on the Western side. May be these makes the difference in the temperatures? Also possible it's the proximity to the water.  Here are some pictures showing a train bridge parallel to my road over the Colorado river in Parker AZ and a gentleman water skiing on the river.    I've spotted on my way to town another Motel 6 and decided to take this for the rest of the day and evening. As usual I was planning again to continue in the middle of the night until I get out from the desert zone.   
This was another long day and I did not find any suitable place to sleep along the way. The terrain was mountainous as well as was abundant in vegetation but mostly of the cactus family. Finally I thought that I found a good spot to pitch my tenth when I've spotted a rattlesnake sneaking into one of the many holes in the ground. When I looked more carefully around me I've spotted many other holes in the ground and thought that there might be snakes in some of the holes around. So despite being tired and it was getting dark already I've decided to continue. I arrived late evening in Wickenburg and rode along the main street, which was also the route I've arrived, when I've met a young gentleman smoking outside of a Safeway supermarket. I've asked him if there is any park in the area or a campground and he told me that on the other side of the town, there is a RV park. I've found it as he described and since it was already after 10:00 PM there was nobody in the office to register. I've knocked on a door in one of the mobile homes in the park, where a mother and son lived and were having a grill outdoors and they told me to pitch a tenth in an empty spot and to I look for the owner in the morning. I've done so and selected a nice spot near one of the houses under a big tree and nice lawn and felt a sleep very fast. 
On this section I finally for the first time made use of the Adventure Cycling Maps on part of my route this day. As I approached Phoenix the roads started to get more crowded with cars. There I've spotted a nice looking old style building that was a dinner and a restaurant. As I was not sure how much more I'll be circling before I find a spot to rest I stopped there for a good lunch and some rest. The Adventure Cycling maps take you throughout the Phoenix area on a route that avoids most of the congested areas by using the trail along the aqueduct. This aqueduct crosses most of the metropolitan Phoenix area but it ends at certain point. At least it ended somehow for me. It's easy to follow as long as you can read the signs around you because it's still enough light. Once it start to become darker you must be careful not to take a wrong turn as happened to me, causing me to do a bit extra miles. Luckily for me I've met this local cyclist, Chris Forsyth who was riding in the area this Sunday afternoon. We started a conversation and it turned out that he is ex Silicon Valley resident who moved into the Phoenix area because of affordability in housing. He went out of his way to show me the route by accompanying me all the way until somewhere in Tempe. Here he treated me to a dinner in a Subway restaurant, which by the way became one of my favorite eating places along the way later on. After that he showed me where are some of the Motels in the area and we parted after he phoned his wife to pick him. The Motels turned out were not too cheap, in the vicinity of $60 and I was not ready to pay this amount especially as I just rode 70 miles today and was still feeling good. I continued for a while until I passed near the airport and started to look for a place to retire. In the course of my search I've spotted a sign to a local park and decide to head there. The park turned out to be a trail and some trees and a golf course. The gate to it was closed so I decided to pitch my tenth near the gate to the golf course on top of some small hill. Except of the occasional noise from the airplanes taking off and landing it was very quiet. My luck was that the gate to the golf course was closed because the sprinklers went off shortly after I've retired. This experience was not enough to avoid another sprinkler shower later on in Arizona. 
 , was taken from my spot where I slept in the morning after being awakened by the early birds arriving for a golf session. It was amazing to see many interesting cactuses in one section of Arizona, mostly before Phoenix and I told myself that there would be enough time to take some pictures them. However suddenly the landscape changed and there was no more interesting vegetation so I could not show you some of the nice and tall cactuses I've been seeing along my way. After a breakfast that consisted of cooked oats and coffee I've continued on Route 60 to Globe. It was a hot day and some climbing in the excess of 4000 Feet. I've arrived to Globe around 8:00 PM and slept for $5 at Gila County RV Park.  I think that $5 is a reasonable price to pay for a campsite for a cyclist, because as an alternative you may consider sleeping for free wherever.  In the campsite I've met a couple from China that were travelling the US by car and sleeping in campsites. They were speaking a reasonable good English and we engaged in brief conversation about touring in general and bicycle touring in particular. They were quite impressed when I told them that I'm going to Florida and have started few days ago from San Jose, CA. Well another short encounter with car riders, but these people seemed to be interested more in cycling than the average traveler I've encountered. It's probable due to their background. From a documentary I've seen about China looks like most of the people there are riding a bicycle. 
The day was going a bit slow and I've made multiple stops to rest. As I approached Fort Thomas it started to get dark. When suddenly I see two guys waving to me from the side of the road. I've decided to stop and see what is going on. These two guys were two fellows from Holland, Vincent and Huub. They were doing the Adventure Cycling route, from San Diego to St. Augustine, FL. They had taken it easy starting in September and planning to finish in March in Florida.  This place Ft. Thomas is a place where a monument to commemorate the founder of Lions Club International, Melvin Jones is erected, http://www.rimcountry.com/lions.htm. Lions Club International is an organization that helps blind people all over the world. The guys from Holland told me that they have just finished doing their laundry and ate their dinner in the small restaurant nearby and are planning to spend the night here in the park near the monument. The small park there had a nice green lawn and I told them that it's Arizona and the sprinklers will start late at night. But they wanted only to lie on the grass. I can understand them going through the desert and suddenly having a nice and green piece of land. In any event they hanged their laundry around on the fence and we spread our mattresses on the grass and fell asleep without even erecting our tenths, as it was quite hot. Well couple of hours later in the middle of the night the sprinklers started their work wetting us and their clothing and sleeping bags. We woke up fast and grabbing our belongings we ran away from the sprinklers. We ended sleeping behind a wall that had only sand in its vicinity and were not disturbed until the morning. 
I've continued on Rt. 70 toward I-10. This was not the Adventure Cycling route but it was a more straightforward one from the Arizona State map I had.  When I rode along Rt. 70 I've passed a state prison and worried about the signs saying do not pick up strangers in this area. I've seen many more signs like this later on and always worried about any surprises. Along Rt. 70 I've started to see some thunderstorms and worried that there will be big rain pouring down soon. The next pictures were taken during the thunderstorms I've seen in the sky. It was also a sunset and it was getting dark already. To describe my experience from riding on Interstate highway it really feels great. The road is not as winding as the other route and there are fewer climbs as well. The only negative things are the volumes of traffic, the tractor-trailers blowing you away when they pass and do not change lanes. Most of them actually do, especially at night when I was more visible. Another problem seems to be the noise of the sometimes-exploding tires on the Semi Trailers and they even do not bother to stop as they have double wheels. This debris from the steel belted radials finally works it's way through the bicycle tire causing a puncture. This happened to me once. This kind of a hole causes a slow leak because the wire is very thin and you notice suddenly a very soft ride. Since it was already dark I've decided to stop by Bowie and look for a place to camp there. I was looking for any place to sleep. It was so dark over there that I could not see any houses around or a place to pitch my tenth. Only than I've spotted a local country store and stopped by to purchase some bread and sardines. Also I've asked the lady owner if there is any camp and she told me that near the entrance to the town, the way I arrived from there is one. However she emphasized that they might be closing already. She was kind enough to locate their phone # and told them to wait for a cyclist that should arrive there shortly. I've arrived there just as the night guard was closing and he told me I can sleep here and pay the owner in the morning. I've notice that he also as many other people I saw in Arizona had a gun at his belt. There was only another trailer nearby and I've pitched my tenth under some tree nearby the road. This small place had even showers. Because of the proximity to the prison I had a difficult time to fall a sleep but was so tired that I fell asleep after all.     
I've left and continued on Interstate 10 toward Deming New Mexico. This last place, Bowie I've stayed is just not far from New Mexico border. The ride on I-10 was again smooth except of the noise and sometimes the turbulence from the passing trucks. Along the way I've stopped and ate at some gas station. Some of them have good and abundance of refreshments as well as some fruits and veggies.  I've arrived to Deming after dark and started to look for a place to sleep. I did not see any open space or park along my way as it was already night neither I saw any people around to ask for a place to stay. However after a while of touring around I found what appeared to be a health club which also had a pool. It was situated in a quiet area and I did not see people around. So I've decided that it's a safe place to stay overnight. I've approached the building from the rear entrance and decide to make the night at the entrance to the pool on the concrete. I did not bother to attempt to pitch my tenth as it was hard ground around and also did not want to raise any suspicion. I've tied my bike to the gate of the pool and fell asleep fast in my sleeping bag. 
I've arrived in Las Cruces at night already and passed a road that had few motels. I've stopped by one and asked the lady attendant how much they charge. She told me it would be $22 and includes coffee and donuts in the morning. Since I wanted to save on accommodation whenever possible I used her yellow pages and called three RV parks in the area. However there was no reply from any of them. So I've decided to stay at this Motel. It also had laundry so I took advantage of this and did some laundering before retiring and called family in CA as well as my mother in Florida. As soon as my mom heard me she told me again to take a plane and arrive to her this way. However I was getting closer and did not consider her offer of funding my airplane trip to her. But I still did not reach the lone star state of Texas! 
The distance from Deming to El Paso is not too big, but the city of El Paso is quite big and also extends East to West along the US-Mexican border. I've cycled as much as I could throughout the day and major part of the day was spent crossing the city of El Paso. In the midst of my trip through the city I've notice at one point that people wave to me and some even stop to ask me where I'm going to Mexico, and they also shouted viva Mexico. Only than I've realized that I took a wrong turn and instead of going east I somehow took a turn on the road which lead me to the Mexican border. I've turned around and found my way back to my route. As this time I did not intend to go to Mexico but rather go toward Florida through Texas. After some wrong turns I finally arrived late night at one of the campsites in the city that is mentioned on the Adv. Cycling map. The place I've arrived was located on a hill and looked nice, until the guy who was in charge that night told me that the price is $20. I though he must be kidding. After paying for a campsite as low as $3 or camping for free, the $20 price looked steep and a rip-off to me. I told the guy that I'm going to talk to the owner the next morning and this gentleman just wanted me to make sure I've registered.  Since I've arrive already late the local Pizzeria was closed and I've decide to cook something before I retire as I was getting very low on energy. I cooked some oats and Rahmen noodle soup and ate some fig bars, which together with the Rahmen noodle soup became a component in my array of foods consumed during my trip. Since I was not able to fall a sleep, probably being upset about the high price of the accommodation I've turned my radio on and scanned the dial when I came across an oldies station from either El Paso or Ciudad Juarez which is bordering El Paso. In any event the music was so good that I've listened to it for long time into the early hours of the morning, and I fell asleep while listening. 
As soon as I hit the road I've placed my earphone with the oldies into my right ear. I never block my hearing while cycling, but I could not give up on this station. The cycling was very easy despite the heat and the head wind, with the nice music I was listening to.  After leaving the city I've continued on state route 20 and 258. The road was passing very close to Mexican border and I've seen numerous border patrol police cars along the way. At one point of my trip I've seen along the way few horses, looked like wild horses on the left-hand side of the road. The left side was elevated, approximately 20 feet. Suddenly I've seen one horse started to gallop in the direction of my trip than turning and changing the direction on the road and directly toward me on the right side of the road. I became very scarred and moved automatically to the left side of the road, at which time the horse turned in front of me and run again back to the other horses to the left of the road. Well this was a bit scary experience, and to this date I'm not sure why he did galloped toward me as he did. I've arrived into Sierra Blanca at night and started to look for a place to stay. I've spotted a Motel, which also said RV campground. I've asked the owner if I can camp here and how much it should cost. He said, I guess you're a cyclist and will not be using the electrical and water hookups, therefore you can stay for free. It was a well-deserved change for better, after paying the other day $20 for a campsite. I was the only person in the campground area and found a spot behind some bushes where I've decide to pitch my tenth. This was just along the main street of the town. 
I've arrived in the early hours of the afternoon and noticed that most of the motels are along the central street of the city. I've toured around until I found what looked like a cheap Motel but also was not run down. I knocked on the door and it looked like a neat place, and the price was right of $18 only. It had a cable TV and nice clean looking room. Also decided to treat myself for a decent lunch, the first time in the duration of my trip. This was also about the midpoint of my trip in terms of time elapsed. I ate a full course lunch with soup and multiple deserts (sweets are one of my weaknesses) and coffee all for the price of $13. The name of the small Mexican Caf was Rosa's Caf. I would heartily recommend this place for any one ever visiting Van Horn Texas. After lunch I bought some supplies in a local supermarket and decided to retire early to plan for the next part of my trip and to decide how much shall I use the Adventure Cycling maps and how much the state maps. I've decided that I'll be going a different route that the Adv. Cycling recommends. My route although may be less interesting and more traveled was a more straightforward one. I've decided to use Rt. 90 from Van Horn to Marfa and than to continue to Alpine. Since it looked like there will be no services for the next 80 miles or so I had to take enough water and decided to fill-up all my containers including the one-gallon collapsible one. 
I've arrived in Marfa late afternoon and decided to make my stop here in this lovely little town famous for it's display of lights at night, http://www.marfachamberofcommerce.com/. I've stopped by a local gas station to buy some food as well as gasoline for my MSR stove. It appears that the stove is very efficient as I still had some gas left and decide to fill the canister now in the middle of my trip. I've asked the attendant if she knows of any park in the area that I could possible camp. She replied that her uncle is an owner of a local RV park and gave me the directions. I've found the place easily and when I've arrived there it already became dark. It looked like a family operated business and they charged me only $7. The place had showers and nice outdoor covered kitchen and the owner told me that I could use all the facilities of the kitchen. I've taken the advantage of it and decided to cook a good meal for dinner tonight. This saves me the effort of starting my MSR stove and washing my utensils.  Since I had the full kitchen to my disposition I took advantage of it and went to nearby grocery to buy some supplies. I bought 6 eggs, mushrooms, potatoes and milk. I've prepared scrambled eggs from 3 eggs with mushrooms and mashed potatoes. This was quite satisfying and tasty meal. The rest 3 eggs I've boiled to take with me for breakfast and lunch tomorrow. After taking a shower I retired and fell asleep fast.         
I've arrived in late afternoon hours in the little town of Marathon, http://www.marathontexas.net. On my way I've stopped to eat some cakes at a nice little bakery that even has it is own web site, http://www.geocities.com/shirleysburntbiscuit/. It was just after 4:00 PM and the older lady owner looked like closing the place. However when she saw me parking my bike in front of her store she opened the door wide and welcomed me with a smile. Inside I found various types of cookies, muffins and banana nut bread. I bought one muffin and one loaf of banana bread to eat for dinner. The lady also told me that she opens early morning and she serves breakfast as well. Since I was getting very hungry I consumed the big muffin and left the banana bread for later on.   I've toured briefly around the place and spotted a sign saying RV Motel and park. I stopped there but did not see anyone. It was a huge place with hookups for RVs, water and benches. I went to a small house that looked like an office and it said welcome and if no one in the office please just leave the money here. It also specified that the rate for a campsite is $10. The place had showers and clean restrooms and I decided to stay but was a bit worried as I was the only person in this huge what looked like parking lot and there were no trees around. As I was getting to retire I've suddenly spotted a bearded gentleman with a backpack and sleeping bag and a mattress on his back, nearby my tenth. I've not noticed him arriving. At first I was worried a bit as I've seen this stranger. After a while we struck a conversation and he told me that he missed today's train and will try tomorrow. He said that this place is 'not much of a town' and he has seen nicer spots in his travels. He told me that in recent years he's travelling by trains but when he was younger he used to travel by bicycle like myself. We did not speak for too long because I was planing to get up early the next day, and needed some rest for tomorrow. It took me long time to fall asleep and I'm not sure what was the reason. However once I've heard my new friend snoring, I also fell asleep instantly. I guess I fell asleep soon after since I did not hear him anymore.
It was still very hot during the day and I've stopped what looked like a place to cool of a bit. This was the only store in the town of Dryden. This building also serves as the post office for the area. Although the store did not have many items it a t least had some cold drinks and candies bars to eat. It was also cool enough inside and I spent about an hour chatting with the owner and consuming some junk food. Shortly after I left Dryden I came upon an abandoned house which actually was looking very good and it was painted in white. I've gone behind the house toward the patio, where there was a lot of light from the early afternoon sun and the reflections on the white walls. I've taken my panniers off and decided to study my chain when I spin the pedals in high gear and also turning them back. When I started to move the chain slowly and observed it carefully I've notice that one plate was rubbing the front gear changer. What happened and I've never had such an accident before, was that the pin of the chain moved out and the chain started to separate but still holding together. This made the chain thicker in one spot and it was the part that rubbed the changer. As I've mentioned before I had almost all my tools with me, but in this case the simple chain tool did the job. I've pushed the link back and all the noise was gone. I was really very happy as this noise was bothering me for two days. Later during the day it became very cloudy with winds gusting as usual blowing the wrong direction. It started to rain but these were only single few big drops of rain but it was still very warm. I even did not bother to put on my rain gear, which always causes me to become wet from the perspiration than from the outside rain. When I finally reached the town, population 20 or so of Langtry I stopped by the local convenience store to get something to drink and buy a sandwich. A passing by shopper asked me if I've some rain gear and warm clothing. At first I did not realize the question when she completed by saying that there should be cold front moving to the area tonight bringing rain and temperatures should drop to 40s. I was not ready for this after twenty dry and hot days of travel. Unbelievable change, one day the temperature is the low 100s and the next day in the 40s. However I had no choice I was going forward to Florida. Langtry is famous because it's association with the life and work of the judge Roy Bean, http://www.desertusa.com/mag98/aug/papr/du_roybean.html. I've bought some food there and asked the owner where can I camp here and he told me that in Langtry near the old school now vacated I could camp for free. I cycled further until I reached the end of the winding road. I should perhaps point out that the town itself is very close to the Rio Grande river and Mexican border. The place did not have any showers but there was running water and I found a nice spot under a tree to pitch my tenth. It was very windy even at night, which was not usual from my experience of the previous days, and I made sure that my tenth is staked very well. Despite the wind I fell asleep very fast. 
Soon after I've afterwards it started to rain and it looked like the rain was going in my direction. Since I had some tailwind I was moving a bit faster than usual. The rain intensified and I found some tire repair store along the way to hide and wait out the rain. The guy in addition to the tire store also had some supplies, which I nibbled on while it rained. When it looked like there was a break in rain I picked up myself and continued. The rain however started again just before Rio Del. The winds stopped and it was a steady but light rain. Along my way I've noticed chamber of commerce for the city of Rio Del and stopped by to pick up some brochures as well as to see if there are any cheap motels. From the list I've picked up I've found one for $22 and decided to look for it. It was not the best looking Motel but with the bad weather I've decided to stay there. I ate my dinner in the room cooking some of the stuff I had and opening couple of cans I've purchased in Dryden earlier. The rain continued all the time and I was wandering if I should stay here another day. However I did not like the Motel and decided that I'll continue weather permitting. 
It was raining very bad all the way. The creeks started to overlfow and the water was covering the low lying portions of the road. I was hoping that I'll get to Brackettville before I will need a boat to continue. One thing that was keeping me moving were the passing motorists and giving me thumbs up. However none offered to give me a ride or asked if I needed anything. When I arrived to Brackettville in the late afternoon hours the streets were deserted. I was looking for someone to ask if there is a place to stay. Finally soaking to my bones I found an open hardware store and a salesperson gave me directions to Fort Clark, where he said I should be able to find accomodations, http://www.fortclark.com/. I cycled for a little while and was stopped on the way by a uniformed guard but no gun and I told him that I look for a place to stay. He directed me further into the Fort and I found the main office which was still open. They said that they had rooms and told me it costs $50. Well I was a little bit shocked but in this weather I probably would not be able to find anything else. They however mentioned that there is also a campground nearby for $12. But looking at the ground which was soaked and the water running down in streams I've decided to take the room hoping that I'll stay one night and continue next dy. The rooms were very neat but there was no TV. In the rooms. (As a side NOTE: from reading today on their WEB site they say that there is a Cable TV in the rooms!). But this is what was available. Looks like there were few other guests and the Motel looked like almost full. After showering and resting a little bit I've changed into my sweat pants and sweatshirt and headed to the restaurant which was situated in and adjecent building. One thing which I've forgotten to mention is that Texas is great on steaks. There is so much cattle and ranches that you'll barely find any vegeterian meal. It's steak and steak all over the state. After dinner I've read a bit in the magazines I picked earlier in the office and fall asleep in a very comfortable bad. 
The next pictures show the beautiful green scenery outside and the water coming down. There was not much to do and I mostly rested did some exercise running up and down the stairs of the motel and once for shopping in a small supermarket located in Brackettville to make preparations for the continuation of my trip.         
According to my maps the next closest location was Camp Wood a distance of about 50 Miles and the next location was Leakey a distance of about 80 Miles. Since I've rested well and ate well I decided to try to reach the town of Leakey. I was riding all the way in the steady rain and the cold. Some of the climbs were warming me but the descends were freezing me. Just before Camp Wood I've started to fill that my ride is a little bit soft. I just started to roll into the town and noticed that my rear tire is soft. I tried to pump it but after a while it was soft again. I stopped in some deserted building and tried to repair the flat. My hands were so frozen that I could not take the tire off. After a great deal of effort I finally repaired the flat and pumped my wheel. Looked around and decided to stop by at a small grocery on the corner of the main street. There I drank some hot chocolate and ate some bananas and few donuts. I also asked the ladies working there if they know of any cheap motel in the town. They called couple of places for me but there was not reply. My hands were so cold thatthe store manager lady recommended that I get myself couple of dishwashing rubber gloves. They told me that some motorcyclists that passed here before and were also suffering from the terrible cold bought them as well. This was not a bad idea and a good investment, they definitely helped my hands to stay warmer although they were wet from perspiration. After a while someone stopped in the store and the lady asked if they know of any motel that is open and the lady said there is Bead and Breakfast that is available. The lady from the store called around and found that there is one for $25. She gave me directions and I found the place by knocking on some doors and asking people around. The lady that owned the B&B said that she'll charge me only $25 but normally she charges between $75 and $100. Well lucky me! Actually the B&B turned out to be couple of rooms that the lady rents in her house. She also gave me a pair of dry sweatpants and sweatshirt so I could dry mine, which were completely soaked despite my rain gear. I took a shower and got dinner. After that I've retired hoping that my clothing will dry till the morning near the fireplace that I had to keep burning by loading some heavy logs of wood. 
The road was very winding and with many hills, not in particular very high but consistent up and down. This caused me to have an elevation gain of over 6000 feet during that day and to feel very exhausted. The section of the road that run along the Guadalupe river was very nice, winding along the river and was flat . This whole ride could turn even nicer if not for the cloudy skies and the occasional rain. As I've started to see houses it was also getting dark and I've decide that I'll be looking for a place to stay here. I've arrived to Ingram toward the late evening hours and decided to take a first Motel that was along the way. I did not look further as I was quite exhausted and getting hungry. The Motel name was Hunter Inn Motel and there was a nearby restaurant that also advertised some special catch of the day. The Motel cost me $42 and the dinner in the restaurant $11.  NOTE: I'm still not seasoned enough to sleep in a campground when it's raining and the ground is soaking wet. I'm not sure how others are doing it but I definitely would like to know. The relatively high price of the Motels is taking its toll on my budget. 
In this park there was an announcement on the office door saying if it's closed than look for person in spot # (this and this) to get your spot assigned. In such nightly instances my Petzel lamp becomes very handy as it gives me enough light to look around. As I also found many of the campgrounds are located in woods and most of them do not have any lightning except for place like bathrooms or showers. In any event after meeting that gentleman he assigned me a spot and also registered me. The cost for this accommodation was $12. Since I was hungry on my arrival I've cooked Rahmen noodle soup fortified with my oats and some bread. I've taken a shower and retired. Fell asleep fast despite cool winds outside, because it was very warm in my sleeping bag. Woke up at night hearing the rain drops falling on my tenth. Since I was prepared for it I've put the rain cover on my tenth, something which I not always did, if it looked like it will be warm at night. Since I always carry earplugs with me I've used them this time and have fallen asleep right away again. 
Sometime during the early afternoon hours I got terrible pain in my Achilles tendon while cycling. The pain was so bad that I could not push on the pedals with my left foot. This was the foot that got the pain in the tendon. The pain was so bad that I was pushing for a while with my right foot. When it happen I've stopped at the side of the road and attempted to do some stretches but the pain was very bad. I've decided to pull into a parking lot near some small shopping center. As I was stretching there a local gentleman approached me and asked where I'm going and where I'm coming from. I've told him what I've been doing and he said that he has two sons and they will be very inspired to hear my story. He offered me to stay with him in his house and spend the rest of the day with his family. Since it were only early hours afternoon I wanted to cycle more despite the pain and told him that I still have a lot to go today and thanked him for his offer. He was very disappointed but declared that he understand that I had to move forward. Looks like the stretching did help a little bit and I was able to continue with the lingering pain in my tendon. After arriving to Bastrop: http://www.bastropchamber.org/ I was looking for an accommodation and in particular for some cheap Motel. I wanted to rest a little bit and take care of my tendon. It appeared that all the Motels were full. I've decided to stop by the local Pizza Hut, which had some special but when I entered they told me that they are closed already. I told one of the waitresses that I've just arrived after cycling the whole day and I'm very hungry and if she could do something about it. After short consultation they gave me many slices of Pizza and a drink and charged me only for one slice, (very nice of them!). I was planning to eat the pizza outside but before leaving I've asked them if they know of any park in the are I could camp. They gave me directions to Barstop State Park that was on a hill on the outskirts of the town and I headed to spend the night over there. When I got to the vicinity of the park I could not find the place where that campsite was as it was very dark in the area. Luckily for me a couple just left a local bar and they showed me the exact way to the park by leading me with their car. On my arrival to the park I've found that it was already closed, actually there was none in the office and I've decided to sleep there despite this. The place was almost deserted but I could see few RVs between the trees in the dim light that was available in the area. I've found a spot away from the other cars and set my tenth, took a shower and fell asleep very fast again. This is the link to the beautiful state park: http://www.tpwd.state.tx.us/park/bastrop/, but I did not have the time to appreciate all this beauty as I was on a trip and not so much on a tour. I think that on my next crossing of the US I'll make sure to stop more in the nice places and enjoy the surroundings more than I did this time. 
The Motel I've stayed was OK, and since I already was in a Motel I've decided to do some laundry and also to eat out again, after a long break from eating only self cooked food and occasional sandwiches/pizza along the way. I've asked the attendant in the Motel, HILLTOP MOTOR INN about a good restaurant in the area and she recommended a close by a Mexican restaurant which turned out to be very good and reasonable priced and as well as serving big portions. The last part was always of importance for me on the trip, since I've been almost constantly hungry. The place she recommended was the 'CASA OLE MEXICAN RESTAURANT'. From the fact that the place was packed I could judge that it must be a good and popular restaurant. I can only add that I was not disappointed. The only thing that bothered me a little bit was that I did not have any suitable clothing to go there in. So I dressed on top in one of my T-shirts and the bottoms I had my cycling rain pants, which are black, with some reflective straps. But nobody paid attention. The reason I've dressed like this was that I was worry about the air conditioning being too cold and having bad impact on my tendon problems. I do not recall the price I paid but it was not more that $15 for a full course dinner and a tip. After dinner I went back to the Motel which was just across the street and watched some TV before falling a sleep. 
As usual when sleeping in a Motel I've started the day toward the late hours of the morning. I've checked out at the designated time from the Motel around 11:00 AM and was on my way toward Navasota. Navaosta is a nice little town full of colonial buildings and many small shops. I did not stop in the town as it was early afternoon hours and the streets were very busy with shoppers. Since I was feeling relatively refreshed after the late night in the Motel I decided to cover larger distance today. I've used Route 105 that passed through Sam Houston National forest. But this route also was without any place to stay or camp along. I've started to think about camping in the woods but they were very thick on the edge of the forest and I decided to continue further. It was getting darker as I was still passing through the forest and I was not sure when it's going to end. I've been desperately searching for a place to stay but there was nothing suitable along the way. Therefore I continued further until late at night I've passed a sign that pointed to a place called 'Pumpkin RV Resort'. It was among very tall trees and was looking very clean, but the resident manager apparently already retired so I decided to select a spot and settle there and see what happens in the morning. The place had very nice and clean facilities and also a recreation room with kitchen for use by all the residents.  I've showered there ate at the clean and roomy kitchen and retired to my tenth. 
This was a relatively easy day and the temperatures were comfortable and despite the low hovering clouds it did not rain at all. I think I already had enough rain for the rest of my trip, although I still had the rain gear and was prepared for any surprise that may emerge. This also was my last day of the whole section being in the state of Texas. As some people were saying to me earlier during my trip in New Mexico and Arizona, do not consider yourself done until you cross the 'great' state of Texas. It really started to feel easier altogether once I had the sense that I'm approaching the eastern border of Texas. Due to it's varied terrain and weather surprises this state is more challenging than other on my route has. OK, California desert was also tough, but at least it was consistently hot. Once you set your mind on the fact that the weather is such and such you can get used to it and work your way around or through it. But haven't temperatures jumping from low 100 s to low 40s in couple of days can definitely take the toll on your mind if not your body. I've approached the town of Silsbee TX toward the early hours of the night. I've started to look for a place to pitch my tenth and passed nearby a sign pointing to an RV park. I've deviated from my route and reached the park in short time. I've met some people there probably local residents having barbecue outside. I've asked them if I can stay here and they said that I need to talk to the manager and showed me the house in which he lived. Although it was late I dared to knock on his door and he opened dressed in his pajamas. I've said sorry to bother him so late and he said it's OK since he was watching late night TV. I've asked about accommodations and he said that he does not have camping here due to lack of bathrooms. Seems like the other people have had some other arrangement in their RV and mobile homes in the park. I continue on Rt. 190 and saw a cheap looking Motel. I've stopped there and for $30 made a night stop. The place was OK and I was already so tired and it was late that I did not bother to continue looking further. Although it always hurt me afterwards whenever I've had to spend this amount of money and I could sleep in my tenth. I promise myself that I'll be taking advantage of my tenth more on my next trip. 
I've rode Rt. 96 to Kirbyville and than followed the Adventure Cycling route to Louisiana. Early afternoon along my way I've met another cycling going in my direction. This gentleman name Steve was going from San Diego, CA to St. Augustine, FL. He was travelling on a racing bike with very light load and even had aero wheels. He even told me that he had problems earlier with his wheels and he had to get a new set. Looks like he was mostly staying in Motels and occasionally slept hanging among tree on a bivouac. We continued together to Louisiana and talked along the way. The trip this way was much easier. The shoulders were wide enough at this section of the road and we could ride side by side. As we crossed to Louisiana it started to drizzle. We continued for a while until we reached the town of DeRidder in LA. We followed the Adv. Cycling directions and decided to stay in one of the Motels they've recommended. We found the Skippers Motel for $38 for the night and decided to stay there. Originally along the way we spoke about the possibility of sharing the room to save expenses and he was ready to this idea, however at the registration he changed his mind and wanted to stay by himself. I went along with this idea. This was the last time we spoke or saw each other. Looks like the guy wanted to be left by himself and would not be a good companion anyhow for the rest of the trip. In the Motel which was very neat and nearby a Domino's Pizza parlor and other small shops I've taken a shower watched some TV and went down to buy some food. I've ordered extra large Pizza that was on special that evening and while it was prepared I've stopped by some groceries store and purchase more food for the rest of my trip. When the Pizza was ready I've taken it to the Motel and consumed most of it while I watched TV. It was quite a big Pizza and I've left two slices for breakfast for tomorrow morning. I've felt a sleep soon afterwards in the comfortable Motel bed.
Surviving this I've approached Opelousas http://www.cityofopelousas.com/ also known as the 'Zydeco' music capital of the world. This fact was not know to me before arriving there, otherwise I would be looking for a place to listen to this nice music of which I'm a fan. I've learnt this fact only while writing about my trip these days. After arriving to the city I've started to look for a place to pitch my tenth, since it was already close to 6:00 PM and I was tired enough to call it a day. Along the route I saw a sign pointing to camp. I've followed the signs through some wooded and neat looking and tree shaded streets until I've arrived at the South City Park. The main office in the park was still opened and they told me that I could camp anyplace in the park I wish for free. Well this was a nice surprise to find a spot like this. I've looked around and located myself not far a way from a place where there was more light and running water as well as not far a way from the restrooms. These facilities luckily for me stayed opened throughout the night. The place looked pretty safe and except for some wandering couples it was empty. I've not seen also many campers except one RV camping in the whole park. Possible because it was Tuesday only. In the park there were picnic tables that were situated under a metal roof on a concrete embankment. I've decided to sleep in one of these places without setting a tenth. It was warm enough and the roof would protect me from any surprise rain. Also I did not feel any mosquitoes in the area so they would not bother me I thought. I've cooked something light and ate couple of bananas I've bought earlier. After that I went to sleep using only my mattress and sleeping bag. Luckily none bothered me at night and I've even seen a Police patrol car that comes there once in a while to check what is going on. The light from the policeman flashlight has awakened me. This happened only once and none shinned light in my direction afterwards. I slept well until I was awaken by a water condensation dripping from the metal roof on me. I've moved under the picnic table where the water could not reach me and fell asleep until the morning. 
The road was mostly flat road but again the Rt. 190 proven to be quite busy thoroughfare. It passed mostly through agriculture area and some forests. There were sections of the road that did not have any shoulders and the dangerous moments were during rush hour, when there were motorists approaching from both directions. Sometimes they forced me to go of the road as some of the motorist did not pass and I did not felt secure having someone just behind me all the time. So I gave them right away. On my way I've stopped to buy some groceries in a small town grocery store. I've been eating some of the food they prepared and also bought some to take with me. The people in the store, in particular the ladies were wandering if I'm going to eat all myself, on which I've replied that yes. I've explained to them that if one cycles as much as I do in one day with all the load than this person needs more than average quantities of food. At the same time there came a bread delivery truck to deliver bread to this grocery. When the driver overheard the conversation he asked me if I want some bread to take with me. I told him that I already bought some food that he said this is free and offered me two loafs of fresh bread, which I've taken and thanked him. I continued to Baton Rouge, LA. The section of Rt. 190 just before the city became very busy, but it also widened and there were some shoulders along the route. On the western side of the city I was approaching the Mississippi River. There just the arched metal bridge crossing the river two guys in a pickup truck stopped by and offered me a ride over the bridge, asking me if I can make it since it may be too steep for me. I've thanked them and said I've already climbed steeper roads than this and than they asked me where I'm going. When I told them that I'm going to Florida they were quite impressed. Than they asked me where I've coming from I've said from California, or more exact San Jose CA. Of course they did not know where San Jose was but the word California was enough to impress them even more. We talked for a while and I've started my climb over the river. It was really very steep but when I've used my low gears it was really not so bad. What was nicer than this was the descent on the other side of the bridge to the city. I continued straight on Rt. 190 through the city where the traffic was quite bad but I've crossed it without any incidents.  After crossing the city the road became again the more familiar and quieter the way I like it. The passage through the city of Baton Rouge was quite hectic but not as bad as it could be and the view from the bridge on the river is really spectacular.  I've continued on Rt. 190, also called 'Florida Blvd.', until the little town of Albany located at the junction of Rt. 190 and Rt. 43. When I hit Albany it was already dark and I did not see any Motel along the way. Being also tired and hungry I've stopped by local grocery that was still open. I bought some supplies and also asked the owner about Motels in the area. She said that there is a bigger town further east called Hammond and it has many motels. There is although one in Albany she said but she's not sure if it has vacancy. After consuming some of the food I've decided to push myself a little bit more and in about three-quarters of an hour I've reached Hammond. Right away I could see few Motels and restaurants along the main street and decided to look for a Motel in that town. I've found a Motel for $29/night and decided to stay there. Although the room was pretty small it had clean bathroom and a big TV to compensate for. The owner also told me that there is a good pizza in town if I would like and they still may be opened. I decided to play it large and instead of going there I've called in and ordered large pizza. It arrived shortly, even before I had a chance to take a shower. I ate the pizza while watching TV into the late hours of the night.     
The gentleman told me that there is a State Park along the shoreline and I could camp there. He told me the directions on how to get there and I've headed to the place that was few miles away. The road took me along the beautiful coastline of Louisiana and it's white sands. When I approached the place it was already dark and in the light of my headlight I've noticed a sign along the road saying 'Alligator crossing'. It of course scared me and I've started to pedal faster to get away from the place which looked to me like a swamp. After hitting a higher ground the water around me disappeared and I've seen the gate to the park. The office was already closed but there was a person who was assigning the spots for the campers and he told me it costs $10. After registering with him I went to put up my tenth. The place was warm and there was also some sound of mosquitoes buzzing around. I've put my rain gear on and my cycling cap, which protected most of my body except of the face from the a bit aggressive mosquitoes. The place I've stayed for the night was called Buccaneer State Park. Actually later on I've learned that there are alligators in the swamps in the are I was and the sign I've seen was a warning sign for cars not to hit the alligators that cross the road. Since I was not a car by cyclist I've worried a bit because of what I've seen. After setting down I've showered and went straight to sleep as I was not hungry after consuming the big and delicious waffles and the Waffle House earlier that evening. 
This section of Rt. 90 passes along the Gulf Coast and was one of the high points of the trip. The white sands of the beaches, the warm weather and actually warm and friendly people. They are also very good and careful drivers in this area of the country, at least this was the impression I got. Since this section has such a beautiful landscape the cycling was very easy and enjoyable throughout the day. Despite the fact that I've stopped many times along the way I've still cycled almost 90 miles. At one point along the route I've seen a sign pointing to a bike road which was going to the right of my route on Rt. 90. I've deviated and found myself on a shaded straight like an arrow section which was the bike path. As I sat down on the grass to check if my maps show where does it lead I've met two cyclists coming from opposite direction. I've asked them for directions and they told me that this section of the bike trial was built on an old railway trail and therefore is so straight. I've asked them if there is a grocery store along the way or a place to buy food as I was getting hungry at this time of the day. They told me that few miles down the road there should be a store few miles down. They also told me that this bike path goes for another 12 miles or so but later there are unfinished sections and I may need to get back on Rt. 90 to navigate around. I've continued along this bike path for sometime already but did not see any store. At this point I've met a gentleman who looked like a policeman on a scooter riding the path as well. I've stopped him and we chat for a while. He told me that he has this part time job in addition to his main job and he works as a park ranger patrolling the bike path and the adjacent areas. He also asked me where I'm headed and I told him to North of Miami Florida. He asked me where I came from and than I told him from California he was so impressed that he decided to step down from his scooter and started to talk to me more. I've interrupted him and asked if he knows of any place to buy groceries in the area and I'm actually also thinking about camping somewhere. He told me that there is a Chevron gas station selling hot foot and groceries further down the road near Rt. 90. He also told me that there is a campground but it's in the other direction, i.e. I'll have to retrace some of my route to get to the camp. I've decided to go first for the food since I was really very hungry at this time. I've followed his instructions and soon found a Chevron gas station that also served hot lunches and other stuff. I've decided to eat light meal plus treated myself to an ice cream apple pie desert. I've also bought some food to take with me for dinner tonight and for the road for tomorrow. When I came back this gentleman was heading in my direction and told me that he just phoned his friend who is an avid cyclist and he said that he told him about me. The friend so he tells me very impressed with the story and wanted to know if I could wait until he arrives and meet me in person. Since it was getting rather late at this time I've said that I would rather look for a place to stay and if he knows of any campground in the area. He showed me the way to the park and I've parted with him. I cycled for another half an hour and arrived at the road that leads to the 'Gulf Islands National Seashore Campground'. When I arrived at the gate the visitor center was already closed and I've decided to go in despite that. It was already dark and I barely found my way around and had to use my Petzel headlamp to find the way to and around the park. I've found a spot that looked like a campsite and decided to pitch my tenth. After a while I heard some people talking and I've asked them where are the showers in the park. They told me how to get there and I took a shower ate my dinner and retired relatively early this day.       
As I was proceeding on Rt. 90, which in Mobile is also Rt. 98. Suddenly I've noticed that I've arrived to an entry to a tunnel. When I approached further I could read the small sign saying, 'pedestrians, motor driven cycles and bicycles' are prohibited in the tunnel. The tunnel name is Bankhead tunnel on the name of a famous Alabama governor that was responsible for many projects in AL during his tenure. I was already almost in the tunnel as I've passed this sign. I should admit that I almost did not notice it. So when I backed up again the road and read again what it said I could not believe my eyes. I've not planned any alternate route and was ready to continue Rt. 90/98. So I decided to do some thinking and I was telling myself what could happen if I go through the tunnel. The problem was that I did not know how long the tunnel is and where does it end. Also the traffic there was pretty hectic since it comprised of only one lane in each direction and no barrier in between. While contemplating what to do I've spotted a pickup truck with the logo of Alabama Dept. of Transportation stopped on the street. The driver was a young worker of the Dept. and I've decided to ask him if cyclist can go. He said cyclists should no cross the tunnel. Than I've asked him if he has seen cyclists crossing it and he said that occasionally he has seen. This was enough for me to decide and make the crossing of the tunnel as well. Actually it is not as bright as in this old photo and the traffic is very heavy through it. Luckily it's only about 1 mile or less long but it saves about 12 miles going around through the Bay Bridge or using a ferry, which I even did not know existed until later. What was even more amusing was the fact that after I've crossed the tunnel with motorists driving after me and waiting for the opportunity to pass, I've ended somehow on I-10 going to Florida over the Mobile Bay. There was some confusion when I entered I-10 due to an accident and none of the policeman there paid any attention to me. The wind on I-10 was so strong and it was a tailwind that I was doing probably 30 miles/hour crossing the Mobile Bay going to Florida. All the way I was worried of being stopped but there was also no way to exit as the Highway is crossing the bay. As soon as I hit the other side I was relieved and exit the Interstate on the 1st opportunity on the Florida side. There in a distance I could distinguish a small town and decided to stop there for late lunch. To my satisfaction I've seen the 'Waffle House' sign and made a U turn across the road to get to restaurant, which was on the other side of the road. As I sat at the bar there was a gentleman that sat at the bar as well and we started a conversation me and a conversation broke and he asked me where I was going and I said that I plan to travel on Rt. 90 to Pensacola Florida. He said that this is probably not the best way if I do not mind the ups and downs on the hills of Florida, and I thought that Florida is completely flat. Well not entirely as I've learned later. It's true it's flat in the South but not so in the northern part. It has similar wavy hills of the type I've encountered in Texas, but luckily it's green and the temperatures were not hot as in Texas. But every down was followed by a climb, which of course put some strain on me, and required constant gear changes from high to low and vice versa. I should perhaps interject at this point that Florida with its green scenery, mild temperatures (that time of the year), abundance of campsites and fruits and vegetables was the most enjoyable state to travel. This of course excludes the drivers of the state that were the worse among the drivers of the states I've crossed. Since I felt so good after the food I ate and the ease of crossing the Mobile Bay to Florida that I've continued for a while. I've arrived to Pensacola when it was already dark and passed through the main street and I've seen many youngsters and police directing the traffic. After a while I could hear the noise of  Rock Band playing in an outdoor concert somewhere nearby. Originally I've been thinking to find a public park to camp but the thought that so many young people being late at night outside would not go well with this idea. I've continued on the main street to the other side of the town where I've seen many Motels. I've selected one that looked relatively clean and quiet. I stopped there and took a room for $35 for the night. While not as cheap as I've been ready to spend I was already getting too tired to look for another one. After a nice shower and some light dinner I went to sleep without even watching TV.            NOTE: The Bankhead tunnel under the Mobile bay/river which is on Rt. 90/98 saves about 12 miles or so of travel when going toward Pensacola Florida, from Mobile, Alabama. When not using the tunnel one has to travel over Cohrane bridge. The length of this tunnel is 3,400 Feet, which is approximately 0.7 Miles, however when you've all the cars behind you feel like it's much longer. 
     At one point in my ride I've spotted a small grocery along the route in a place called Harold and decided to stop there to get some food before continuing.  While in the store I've started to chat with the lady owner and her son and asked them about any campground in the area. They told me that over the train tracks few miles to the north there is a State Park that also has campsites. I spent there another fifteen minutes or so and decided to taste the cooked peanuts that they were selling. This is one of these delicatessen that the people in that area and also earlier in Mississippi like to eat. I should add that I did not fall for it and did not sample any more of these specially prepared peanuts. I bought some extra food items in this store and headed toward the campsite. The place was located nearby a river or a lake since along my way I've seen boat rental shops. However they were closed at this time of the day. When I arrived the gate was still opened and the ranger there told me that there is another cyclist who is camping in the campground. Only now I've found the name of this park, it was Blackwater River State Park. He also told me that the price for camp is $8, which was not bad for a neat place like this.  When I arrived at the campground I went to look for the cyclist and found him despite the darkness that already fell on the place. He was already ready to retire, but when he saw me he got quite excited and we decided to talk a little bit before retiring. He told me that he has quit his job in San Antonio, Texas where he lived and worked and decides to make a bike tour from his brother graduation place, a University in New Jersey back to San Antonio, TX. From which I concluded that he was going the other way and I thought I missed the opportunity to ride with a companion. The guy was only 23 and he traveled in the minimalist style having only the necessary equipment in his two small panniers. He used a mountain bike and did not even have cleated shoes. Well it's much easier to travel like this when you're young. At this age not many things bother you and not even the cold. After our conversation I went to take a shower and set my campsite and went to sleep. Even though the place was near water (which I did not see) there were not many mosquitoes, probably due to the light breeze that blew at this time of the night. Id did not bother to eat and retired right away. Before that however I've also noticed another gentleman in my vicinity that was camping but he had a car and a racing bicycle on top of a rack.   
After a while we parted and the young guy and me started toward the exit. Along the way he told me which is the better route to go through Florida. We also talked about some other things and we parted at the junction of Rt. 90 when he continued west while I continued east along Rt. 90. The road continued to have it's up and down patterns, but I already became used to this and was taking the advantage of the downhill descent but than working hard to get back up to the top. The road passed through nice forests and little towns. I've stopped for lunch along the way in a Subway restaurant for some good sandwich and continued to Chipley. When I've arrived there it started to get dark and I've asked if there is any campground or park around. A lady in a restaurant directed me to the Falling Waters State Camp. It took me some time to find the place as it was located of Rt. 90 and it was already getting dark at this time. I've continued in the general direction and was looking for the 'state park road' leading to the park. I've found it with the aid of my Petzel headlight, which comes handy in situations like this. The road leading to the park was winding a little bit and also going up and down. It appeared that the park was located on some hill. When I've arrived at the Falling Waters, State Camp it's gate already was closed as the rules in Florida are such that the park as I've already found it out closes at sunset. I was looking for a place to get through but than decided to take the rear panniers of so I could move the bike under the entrance gate, which was like a railway-crossing gate. I've put the panniers back once on the other side, as there was enough light at the entrance to see what I was doing. I've continued along the road for another couple of miles before I've started to see some RVs. The place was quite dark and I did not have any idea where are the spots of the campsites. I've used again my light and toured around for a while before I located an empty spot. After a while when my eyes became used to the darkness I've spotted the showers a small distance from where I set my tenth. I've retired in my tenth right after showering and eating something for the late dinner.   
In any event I was directed toward the Wakulla Springs State Park. I've assumed that like other State Parks this one will have a campground as well. When I've arrived at the park it was already becoming dark, but there was still enough light for me to see the nicely situated park with many types of trees. I followed the directions until I arrived to something that looked like a beautiful castle. There were many cars arriving there and people were dressed formal dress. The ladies were dressed in dark dresses and men mostly in black in suits. It appeared that there was some convention-taking place in this establishment. It papered that it's a hotel in the park and it looked really nice. I entered inside and asked at the reception if there is also a campground in the vicinity, but I was told that there is none. So I was thinking to my self just to go and sleep outside at the park but than I was not where to look not to be too close to the Hotel. To make the story short I ended up staying in this establishment which was very nice except the price I had to pay and it was $75 for the night. Of course I was shocked but at this late time of the evening and after cycling over 100 miles today I was not ready to look further. To describe shortly this place had marble floors in the rooms covered with carpets. Nice windows antique looking bathroom. There was a restaurant on premises and nice view from the window of my room. There was no TV in the rooms but a big screen TV was available in the lobby. After paying this outrageous sum of money for the accommodation I've decide to cook my meal in the room, instead of going to the restaurant downstairs.  After showering and eating my meal in the room I've listened a little bit to my radio and than fell a sleep in the comfortable bed. Before I'll forget here is a link to this rather nice and interesting place called Wakulla Springs Park. It has many more attractions than the Lodge I've stayed and do plan to visit it again when I'll be in Florida in the future.         
The road continued to pass through forests and farms and nice little towns. There were also plenty of orange, grapefruit and lemon groves. They distributed nice aroma as the day heated up along the way. The weather was mostly sunny and light breeze was blowing. Again I'm remembering this really nice days of my crossing through Florida. Along the way I've stopped to buy some fruits from a vendor that was selling his stuff along the way. Shortly after that I've stopped to make a picnic in an artificial tree farm, where they were growing trees and each section was of different size. The people were going in and out of the place but nobody bothered to stop and ask me what I was doing there. I decide to take also a short nap, just to be interrupted by big ants walking all over me in search probably of traces of the food which were still lying around me. This was the sign for me that I need to continue. After about additional 2 hours of cycling I saw on the LHS of the road a small house that was also a grocery and cars entering and leaving. It also smelled good nearby. I've decided to stop there and see what kind of busy place it is. This happened to be a small grocery and also they were making their own food. They were preparing all kind of fresh home made food that smelled very good. I bought there some stuff and also some groceries and ate my late lunch on the small patio. After the lunch I became a little bit sleepy and decided to seat another  and hour on their patio. I've continued on Rt. 27 toward Cross City. At certain point of the ride when the road was doing its ups and downs, although less than along Rt. 90 more to the north, I was attacked by few vicious dogs that were roaming along the road. This time I've screamed loudly at them which did not help and accelerated, since luckily I've hit the downhill portion of the road I was able to accelerate and outrun the dogs which were hanging around for quite a long time. They gave up as soon as we started the climb seem either they were out of their control zone or they became tired like myself. It was late afternoon and I've started to think about a place to stay. The route was mostly passing among forests and occasionally I could see houses along the way. It was saying that it's about 25 miles to Cross City where I was planning to arrive. Suddenly I've seen a sing along the road that there is a camping available in a Chevron station about 10 miles down the road. So I've decide to reach this place and was hoping that the sign points to some real target and not like happened in the past that some of them were old sign and what they said was not true anymore. I've reached the place after another hour of cycling when it was already completely dark. The place was Chevron Gas station and behind the station they had an open space where the campground was located. There were benches and water and some primitive facilities they called showers and bathroom. But it was something better than nothing at all was. They told me that the cost is $8 per night. Before going to setup my tenth I've decide to eat at this Chevron Gas station that also had a restaurant there and convenience store. I ate there very well again as it was relatively cheap and the food while fat was also very tasty. I've also treated myself to a nice desert. Today I really ate very well and most of it outside, but it did not cost much. I've spent total of about $12 for the lunch and the dinner combined. After the dinner I've entered that campground and started to set my tenth. I've looked around and notice that there was only a couple that traveled with their old RV and they approached me as I was setting my tenth. The gentleman told me his name and told me that he passed me many mile to the North about 2 hours ago and here we met again. He asked me where I was going and where I came from and was very impressed when he heard that I came all the way from California. He was one of those retired people leaving between Florida in the winter and the Northeast in the summer. He was going to Fort Myers where the couple was residing during the wintertime. For those of you who do not know the winter starting October and ending in April is a high season in the wintertime. I took a shower and went to sleep without much delay. 
The day turned out to be nice and warm and the route I've selected passed near the bigger city of Ocala and which I tried to avoid on my trip, the same way I was avoiding other big cities whenever possible. Along the way I took the opportunity in the early afternoon hours to lay my tenth on some bushes along the way and dry it. The road I've selected to ride today was Alt. Rt. 27 and it was in very bad shape. It has been worked upon and had many opened trenches as well as parts of the road were barely passable by the cars due to roadwork along the way. I've seen in Florida this phenomena many time where the highway crews are working on some section and than leave it opened with signs and go and work on some other place. You can see it all over Florida. However compared to some other states they are at least trying to maintain their roads. Since I was on bicycle I took the advantage and road on the section that still looked unfinished with fresh tar but is was quite without cars, which were still packed on the old section of the road. I rode among the trucks and the tractors and other heavy equipment but they were slow so I could navigate among them. Nobody bothered me I continued the ride undisturbed by the cars. After a while I've seen Subway restaurant at an intersection and decide to stop to cool myself down as well as to eat one of their tasty sandwiches. There in the restaurant I've met a group of youngsters who were on a baseball team. Since I was sitting in close proximity to them weve started a conversation during which they started to ask me where I'm going. I told them that I'm going to Boca Raton. They did not seem to know the name of the place but I told them it's North of Miami. Than they started to tell me how far each of them have ridden in his bicycling life. At certain point I was asked where I came from and than I told them from San Francisco, California. I did not want to say San Jose as may not know where it's even though in terms of population San Jose is bigger than San Francisco. When I told them my starting point they could not believe. Well I do mention this just in passing by, however it happened on numerous occasions that people simple couldn't believe that someone would embark on such a long journey by bicycle. I'm sure that those of you who are cyclist will have much easier time to grasp this. Even I myself when I write about my journey more than 2 years after it happened can't believe that I've done it. But during my trip it simple seemed natural, if not a little bit challenging. After the lunch I've continued and by mistake selected the wrong road that looked like it will take me toward the city of Dunnellon, where the campground that I found on the map is located. This few deviation during the day caused me to do more miles today without really advancing toward my target. After some time I got back on the road that had the sign 'Rainbow Springs State Park'. However as it happened the park and the campground where in two separate locations despite the fact that the map gave the same address. When I've arrived at the park it was already late afternoon but I still was able to appreciate the beauty of the park:          It had water that was simple blue and there were few people at this late hours swimming in the water. I've started to look around and asking if the people know where is the campground, but none of them seem to know. Suddenly a gentleman in his swimming costume approached me and asked what I'm looking for. I told him that I look for a campground that should be here. He told me that actually he knows the campground but it's on the other side of the park. But there is no connection from this side to the place where the campground is. I'll need to go around a distance of few miles. It was already getting dark and I was very frustrated that I could not find the place faster. But after weighing my options I decided to continue, as this side of the park did not look like a place to pitch a tenth. It had a lot of small stream in addition to the mail river from the spring and very many trees and shrubs. In addition the gentleman told me that he comes here quite often and he has seen alligators in the spring waters here. This was enough for me to stop thinking about making my camp on this side of the park. Without much choice I've grabbed a can of Coca-Cola from the vending machine that was there to get some energy boost and decided to head to the campground. The guy also told me that I should probable get there before they close the gate, but he was thinking as someone going by car probably. The trip I made looked like traveling along the letter U. along the way I had to stop few times and ask people for directions as it was not obvious how to get there. Everyone was giving me directions based on a known road sign along the way. It was easier for them as they live there. At the end someone mentioned that the road goes near a school and this is a mile after I pass the school. Again wrong estimate by the people and it looks like this if you're motorist. In any event at the end I've found the place and it was north of the school but more like 3 miles after that. When I've arrived at the gate of the park it was already closed, it was after sunset. I've went around the gate through some trees on the sides of the gate and back on the road leading to the campground. It took another 2 or 3 miles of pedaling before I've reached the campground, that is I was now actually completing a circle and was probably not far away from the original spot I came from separated by thick trees and water. The campground appeared to be very big and had nice facilities and even a swimming pool. I've pitched my tenth, cooked my dinner and went to take a shower and retired not before spotting few more tenths and RVs in the park. Looked like it was a popular spot with travelers and passing by tourists. 
I've found my way back to Rt. 41 that is also known as N. Florida Avenue and continued southeast. The road passed through nice little town situated along lakes and interleaved with citrus orchards. I've stopped couple of times to purchase fresh fruits along the way as well as to drink some farm fresh orange juice. Later I've connected to Rt. 27, which is a divided hwy used heavily by trucks. This route is also called Rt. 98 and sometimes alternates into other numbers on the maps. Of course I did not know this and as I've said earlier my goal was to get in the fastest/shortest time from point A to point B. this of course was not always the safest route. Toward the early evening hours I've started to look for a Motel along Rt. 27. There were actually numerous sites pointing to RV and campgrounds available. When I've seen the sign saying something like: Citrus Growers Valley Campground, I've decided to call it off for the day and to settle at this campground. While the name sounded nice the entrance to the park was a complete mess and it looked liked a bombed place. There was a lot of broken concrete and piles of dirt and heavy equipment. The route was making detours and took me some time before I got into the campground itself, which appeared to be much cleaner, that the surrounding area. When I've found the office I was told that they are constructing a new apartment complex in the vicinity and in the meantime turning everything upside down. Seems that because it was already late Friday afternoon the work ceased for today and luckily tomorrow being Saturday, there will be no heavy-duty work during my departure either. At least to minimize the amount of dust being raised by the cards there was a truck that periodically was spraying the road with water to keep the dust on the ground. The manager lady told me that the price for the night is $17, which seemed to be a little bit steep for such a badly surrounded area. But since it was already late and I was tired I did not bother to continue and look further. In addition the place was few miles from the road and it would be too much to go back. On the plus side I've found the place to be very clean and well maintained and every hour the guard on duty was making a trip around the place in an electrically powered vehicle, keeping the noise level to minimum. It had also a guestroom to watch TV and very clean, looked like a fancy hotel showers and bathrooms. I've decided to locate my tenth closed to the bathroom/shower area just in case I'll need to use it. The place had RVs, and mobile homes in it and it looked like I was the only camper in a tenth. After taking a shower and cooking something in the kitchen, I've spent some time talking to the guard and retired to sleep after 10:00 PM. 
The ride was quite uneventful except at one point when I worried when I saw police cars at night and many youngsters trying to get to some dance club. At first I thought that there might be some demonstration, but later realized that they just waited to get in to some crowded dance club or may be a show? Along the way I've stopped in the city of Okeechobee for a late Pizza dinner and was starting to look at the Motels along the main route checking their prices. But when I did not see anything cheaper than $65 I've decided to continue hoping that there might be a campground or I'll find another place to sleep. Once I've started going I continued to cycle to the night and did not stop for a long time. At one point I hit the section of the road that was very dark and foggy and I could not see more than few tens of feet. Luckily there was not traffic on this road but I also did not see any lights, which showed that the road passed either near a lake or some water. I was afraid to step of the road, which had very steep embankment because I worried of falling into water, or whatever hide there down in the darkness. Even my powerful Petzel headlight did not shine through the fog, which reflected the light. The few cars that passed me did so carefully once they saw all the light I had as well as the reflective material on the wheels and the bike as well as my rain jacket that also had reflective stripes. The reason I had the rain jacket was that if was very foggy and the humidity very high. I could almost feel the water droplets in the air. At one point I finally started to see some lights and thought that it was a city or town but it appeared to be a power line rely station which was well lighted and spread on big area. After few more miles I did finally reached the Western suburbs of West Palm Beach Florida. At this point I started to feel close at home (not mine but my mothers) since I was familiar very well with this area. I've decided to continue for a while until I reach the state Rt. 441. When I reached Rt. 441 I turned South to follow the road until Yamato Rd., which is one of the two main roads crossing and leading Boca Raton, Florida. I looked at my watch and I noticed that it was around 3:00 AM. If I continue toward my mother's house at this time I'll probably would arrive there too early and would awake her up. It was only another 30 miles or so to get to where she lives. Since it was Sunday morning I thought my mother would be still asleep. I continued in a slower pace in order to fill in some time. Just before 5:00 AM I've reached a Chevron Gas station that was just opening the services to the public. Like many of the Chevron gas stations along the way this one also appeared to have a well-equipped convenience store. I've decided to stop there to rest, eat breakfast and call my mother. The store manager appeared to be a young Palestinian who came to the US from Jordan. Of course I told him that I'm an Israeli and as soon as he heard this he got very excited but in a positive way. As usual such a meeting sparks a political debate. He told me that he came to this country and first worked at Ford assembly line in Detroit but later on he married an American woman and decided to move to the south and got a job through his friend that owns few gas stations in the Florida area. I also told him why I'm here on a bicycle that actually I came all the way from California to visit my mother who just recently moved to Boca Raton from Israel. He has treated me very nice, he asked the cook to prepare a nice meal for me later asked me if I want some donuts and coffee and I said providing that I'll pay but he adamantly refuse any money. We spent there talking for about two hours and a policeman patrolman who stopped to get some coffee joined us. The policeman said that he's going to find out how is the traffic and weather in the Boca area and left. After a while he called and said that the weather is still foggy and that I should probably wait for a while before continuing. He also said that if I want he can give me a ride since the traffic is very heavy at this time along Rt. 441 and it does not have shoulders at many places. On this I've thanked him and said that if I've survived so far I'll take the chance and continue on my own. I've called my mother around 7:30 AM and I woke her up of course. She was very glad to hear that I'm already very close nearby and told me to head carefully toward her place. I've parted from the gas station manager and wished him all the best in his work and he wished me a safe trip, and after about another hour on the road I've arrived at the place where my mother lives. She was very exited to see me alive and well and said that I look very good but a little bit skinny. Well first thing I've done I jumped on a scale and weighed myself. It appears that I've lost about 16 pounds on this trip. I've started about 186 pounds, which is my average weight and was about 170 LB the day I finished the ride.

After my trip to Amsterdam had totally convinced me that my future lay in a round the world tour, I was completely happy to make the trip on my 60 year old BSA Paratroopers bike. Over a period of time though my thoughts turned to the idea of using a Penny Farthing, I had never ridden one before, but I didn't think that this mattered too much. By late summer of 99 the Penny was up and running, I had made a three speed version to my own design with a 50" diameter front wheel, and a 20" rear. As the year 2000 celebrations approached the thought came into my mind to ride the Penny to Paris..... Boxing day is traditionally a day of rest to help get over the celebrations, not so this year as we were up with the larks on day one of my trip. I had already dismantled the Penny and loaded it along with my provisions and kit into my dads reliable old Citroen. The trip down to Dover was very uneventful, due I presume to it being the day after Christmas, the time when most people are still sleeping off their Christmas day over indulgences. My only worry at the moment is the rotten bout of flu which I have just caught, it certainly couldn't have had better timing for its arrival, though my immune system is now being helped by every pill and potion that exists under the sun!  Arriving in Dover we parked up, carefully removed the bike from the car and I started to rebuild it into its complete state. This took no longer than 20 minutes, and once loaded up with my vast array of paraphernalia we were away. When I say away I ought to quantify this a little better, I rode a good 100yds to the ferry booking terminal ! Here after queuing for an age I was told that I had seven minutes to make the 9.15am boat. With a big rush I raced outside wheeled around the corner and had to foot the Penny up the first hill that I came too ! By the time we reached the boat I found to my dismay that we were too late, and would now have to wait and catch the 12.30 sailing. This was rather a disappointment as this vexatious delay meant I lost a good half days riding time. When it was time to wheel onto the ferry it felt as if all eyes were on me, I had been having a chat with a group of coach drivers who were heading for Switzerland, when I was ushered away as the first person to load. This was splendid as it meant that I was only second in the queue for the restaurant when I went up into the ship. I was then immediately promoted to first place when the people before me asked if I was the mad Penny Farthing rider they had just seen. They then explained that they thought that I probably needed a good intake of vitamins sooner than they ! The crossing took an hour and twenty minutes which was nice, and by about 2.30pm we hit the roads of France ! The truth in those words is greater than you probably realise, I shall explain. Heading away from the Ferry into Calais you first go through a very run down area with a bad road and no people. I was trundling along here pleased as punch that we had at least made it to France when I crossed a set of old railway tracks set into the road. The first ones gave us a bit of a bump but with no ill effects, then we approached another set with even more gusto, unfortunately these were set at more of an angle across the road than the previous ones, so, Crash, Bang, and finally gracefully spread across the road was I. Here I lay in a  sprawled condition across the road once again! Picking myself, and the Penny up, we were approached by a somewhat surprised and concerned looking French fellow, to whom I signed that I was sound in body, though perhaps not in mind. I was extremely thankful that I hadn't buckled the wheel, so I mounted the bicycle again and headed off into Calais. I stopped in the town to do a few running repairs, as I had noticed that the brake was now declining to work, and the handle bars were pointing out at a intriguing angle ! The bars duly re aligned, I quickly spotted that the main axle nut on one side was loose which had caused the lack of brakes. Off I set again and quickly found the road to Coquelles, before this I passed the impressive fort of Nieulay which I liked and thought of as a good camping spot, I decided to press on though to get a few more miles under our belts before the sun went down. Passing through Coquelles it gave the impression of being a typical missed by most type of town, with quite a few empty old buildings about the place. We then came upon a rather long hill which I started to ride up but unfortunately ran out of steam and had to foot the rest of the way. When I reached the top I managed to wheel again for a little distance but then chose to stop as by this time it had become dark. I had pulled into the back entrance of a sleepy farm, and as I wasn't overlooked from the house I thought it would be a good place to pitch the tent for the night. Well big mistake ! I unfolded my tent, then all of a sudden a howling gale appeared and tried to send us both into orbit, as the gale obviously didn't travel alone his acquaintance Monsieur sleet now arrived to keep him company. The next problem was to try and get the tent pegs in, I had chosen stony ground which of course helped matters, and after 15 minutes of struggling with a flailing tent I gave in and repacked it into its bag. On the other side of the road was a large posh hotel, I stumbled over lent the penny against their shiny door, walked inside and dripped on their floor. 65.00 for one night, not possible I'm afraid, I would rather freeze. My alternative was to head back into Coquelles and book into a b+b I had previously observed. Rolling back down the hill I had already pushed the Penny up was fun, though I'm not thinking about having to foot the bike up it again tomorrow at this moment in time ! When I arrived at the b+b hotel the heavens had truly opened, which again was pleasant for me, but fortunately I was let in to the foyer by some Polish people. They had been refused entry into England for Christmas to see their respective boyfriends, girlfriends, and now were sadly heading back to Poland. Officialdom doesn't appear to have much Christmas spirit in the UK. The proprietor of the hotel kindly allowed me to bring the bike inside and block the fire escape which was kind of him, so at least the bike isn't going to get a soaking. I shall cook myself a nice meal on my stove in the room tonight to try and lessen the weight that I seem to be carrying. I have covered a somewhat stunning 6.9miles, with a maximum speed of 17mph today.    Show links to this Hide links to this     
All of these were way too steep for us to wheel up, so it was just down to pushing. I don't normally walk anywhere because I cycle, so all this effort was found to be most draining upon my person. I crossed under the A16 and carried on Southwards in this same pattern and finally arrived in the very pretty but closed town of Marquise. It was here that I turned left onto the D191 and wheeled into Rinxent, to then take the D127 once more in a Southerly direction. The rolling landscape and incessant headwind is really taking it out of me now, and our progress has now become very slow indeed. Even on the flat parts it would seem that I can only generally pull first gear for most of the time, and the down hill sections are soon taken up with a fast coast. I am wondering though how well I could have faired with my old BSA over this terrain ?  Reaching a cross-roads I lent the Penny against a piece of Armco and surveyed my route ahead, the road wound its way up to the church and village of Alincthun placed, not to surprisingly upon the top of a very steep hill. One step after another I pushed the 125lbs of Penny Farthing and kit until finally arriving at the top, exhausted. Here I met the friendly vicar of the village who asked me to pose for him for some photos infront of the church, this I duly obliged to do and then set off again on my journey. Way off in the distance I could see my road dip down into a valley and then off up a sharp inclination into a forest. When I arrived at the base of the climb and looked up ahead, I was only grateful that at least I would be pushing up through pleasant greensward. This walk seemed to take an age but upon finally reaching the summit we had a nice coast down to the bottom of the hill into my destination for the night, Desvres. Here I then started to foot ride again to get up into the town and find the marked campsite. After a deal of toing and froing I was told by a friendly local that the campsite was closed, so with this I quickly gave in and found a small hotel, I put the Penny in their garage and decided that I felt totally exhausted. I was sitting in the bar drinking a rather expensive cup of coffee when the only other patrons entered to acquire some beer. They were five Indian chaps from Leicester who like me were over in France for the Millennium. We had a bit of a chat and laughed that the owners only customers were English, I then had a pee in the most horrible outside latrine, and then retired to a very welcome bed. Today I had covered just 27.8miles, with a maximum speed of 23mph, this is a lot less than I had expected for all the effort it involved     
Here we started another murderous slog of pushing up to the town, we eventually reached the town wall and entered under a beautiful arch. Immediately to my left I found a fabulous cobbled road going up to a fork with fantastic old houses on either side, I of course stopped and took some photos and had a nice chat with some locals.  Unfortunately all the roads then became cobbled and as I wasn't about to try my luck on them, back to footing it was. In the town centre I was accosted by some nice Dutch people for some photos, and then spoke to a friendly French lady about the trip while her husband video'd it all. I then wheeled out of town on the deserted D139 heading for Roussent, along this stretch of road the surface was very bad and also very narrow so I was glad that I was the only traffic. Hunger started to knock on my stomach door at this point so I stopped under an old bridge had lunch, and also a nice brew up, which proved to be a splendid energy boost and wake up. Off we set again and of course went straight into a big hill. When reaching Roussent I turned East and headed along the river for Douriez, the theory being that the route will be flatter along a river. Arriving at Douriez I crossed the river and turned South onto the D212 aiming now for Crecy. After about half a mile I saw ahead of me yet another hill, this turned out to be the worse one of the day, it seemed to be never-ending and when finally reaching the top I really was all but done in. I stopped shortly afterwards at an cafe for a coffee and a refill of my water supplies and then set off to find a camping spot for the night. I found a lovely spot in a corner of a field and thankfully there was no wind so I didn't have any problems with my tent. Having cooked myself up a nice dinner, I curled up in my sleeping bag and fell into a deep sleep. I had covered 37.4 miles with a maximum speed of 20mph.         
They then kindly informed me that it was only one more km of hills then it would be flat, I was very relieved. By the time I reached the Somme river at Pont-Remy I realised that it was his son who was the only cyclist in his family, as there were still plenty of steep inclinations for me to negotiate.  I crossed the Somme at Cocquerel to follow the D21 and on to join the main D901 route. In the town of Airaines I stopped at a Supermarche to stock up on chocolate and other supplies, they sold me five Cadburys type bars all together for just 95p ! When I came outside quite a crowd had formed around the Penny, and when chatting or mainly signing I got an invite for a coffee and a photo by a friendly old Italian fellow. Unfortunately I had to turn him down as his Grand Chateau was in the wrong direction, and I unfortunately couldn't spare the time if I was to make it to Paris for New years, but I hoped for a similar type of invite at the end of the day as well. I wheeled on through the rolling countryside over never-ending hills and still headed south, at this point I managed to devour two whole bars of chocolate to help boost my energy levels, and very nice they were too ! I was so tired from all of the pedalling and pushing that I decided to get a hotel at 4 o'clock, I had just reached the town of Thieulloy l'Abbage and stopped to ask for the whereabouts of some accommodation, unfortunately no hotels was the answer, but 6km further on I would find one. The energy levels were very low at this point so six more km I could have done without, and also it was now getting dark and sleeting. I dug deep and put a big spurt on to reach the town of Poix-de-Picardie in 35 minutes, I was shattered as I wheeled down a long hill which I prayed I wouldn't have to re climb, thankfully I stumbled upon a hotel. Falling through their door into the bar they all looked rather shocked as to what had just arrived ! Having safely stored the Penny in the rear courtyard, I immediately retired to my room to cook some food and have a very deep sleep. I had covered 36.2 miles, with a maximum speed of 23mph.   
After undoing then redoing up the spokes for the third time, I regrettably still had a wheel the shape of a figure of eight, added to the fatigue of the days wheeling and footing, with this outcome I was none too pleased. Visions of this being the end of the road for the Penny and I flashed before me, as I knew that to have any chance of making Paris for New Years Eve, the wheel would have to be repaired tonight. I sat in the foyer of the hotel with a cup of steaming coffee in my hands thinking over the problem, then it gratefully came to me, I must remove the rim from the wheel, straighten that first and then respoke the wheel. Later, as I held a bent 50" Penny Farthing wheel rim in my cold hands, while pushing it against a concrete pillar, I wondered what a funny sight I must be to all my friendly fellow guests residing within these walls. When the moment of truth and several crossed cold fingers arrived, I was mightily pleased to find that I once again had a rideable wheel. I had previously hoped to enjoy an early night and be completely recharged for the big push to Paris tomorrow, this wasn't to be, but trust me when I say that I slept soundly. I had covered 29.9 miles, with a maximum speed of 16mph      Show links to this Hide links to this         

Arriving at the Place De Varsovie which is infront of the tower I was captured by a film crew who had me riding up and down for their sights of Paris show, they then did an interview, and had me say something in French before I rode off into the sunset, or should I say off towards the  Louvre.  I crossed the Seine again at the Pont de la Concorde bridge and entered the long open avenue up the Jardin des Tuileries, here I was told off for riding my wheel which I thought was funny. When I was standing studying with admiration the great glass pyramid which stands within the  courtyard of the Louvre I was approached by a fellow showing interest in the wheel. The friendly fellow who's name I regrettably never acquired offered then to kindly show me around the rest of the Paris sights as he was doing just that himself on this day. My route was to then head north to the Gare Du Nord station to catch the train home, so we led a winding course via the beautiful Notre Dame and the ugly Pompidou centre to the awaiting trains. Now my friend was rather a timid fellow and with the ticket bought he started to fluster over whether they would let me put the Penny on the train. I explained to him that I would just put it in the carriage anyway and not worry about it, he flustered and said that we must ask the controllers permission first because dire consequences could occur otherwise. Being tired I didn't argue, the controller said no, and my train left without me. The next train wasn't until the evening so the plan was to smuggle the Bicycle onto the Metro in a dismantled state to at least get North of the city. I gradually took the machine apart and broke it down to the smallest items, chains, pedals, sprockets, everything off to try and disguise it a little, this operation acquired the attention of the police who came and pointed their guns, but departed again when I pleaded ignorance. Carrying all of the parts and my kit while rolling the wheel wasn't easy, but down we went to the metro over many a stair without an escalator in sight. Sitting waiting for a carriage to arrive the announcement came over the tannoy that all the trains were cancelled due to a strike by the railwaymen, this meant a very long climb back up to the main station, which I did find quite exhausting. Here now of course they had closed the electronic barriers which had been open when we had previously passed through, owning no ticket for these the game was to wait until no one was looking do a little climbing and pass the whole paraphernalia including the wheel over the top. Returning to the main platform I explained to my friend that as soon as the evening train  arrived I would put all of the parts in the carriage tie them up and go to sleep.  The evening arrived and the plan worked to great satisfaction, I bid farewell to my friend and closed my eyes. Pulling into Calais the time was 11.30pm, I pulled all the parts off of the train and on to a handy trolley and then proceeded to wheel them to a covered part of the station.  At just after 1am I had finished rebuilding the machine, I then discovered that they had locked me in the station and that there was no apparent way out, after wandering about for a while I thankfully came upon a night watchman who helped me cross the tracks and escape out of a back entrance. I wheeled around onto the main road, had a little chat with some amazed people, found a hotel that was thankfully still open, then slept the sleep of the dead. Returning home I knew that I would never forget the turn of this century, it has been quite an experience I have to say, but I know that I couldn't ride around the world on this bike, it is just too plain heavy. I have now started to build a much simpler, lighter ungeared version for the next adventure.......   
Although I will not be able to do a ride on the scale of last year's journey for a long time, this summer will have in store a handful of short rides like this one.  Ever since I rested up from last year's trip (a couple of weeks after my return to New Orleans), I have been thinking about new trips and the possibilities they could hold.  This little ride promises to be about 200 miles of fun.  I'll start in the hilly piedmont and endure some mad hills in the river valleys to the northeast like the Patapsco and Susquehanna.  I then hope to enjoy the flattening out of the land as I creep southeast on day three towards a wonderful vacation at a beach house my brother and sister-in-law have secured.   I'll have a digital camera with me this time (thanks Gail!), so I should be able to get a better quality and quantity of shots of my ride and some of the things I encounter.  Thanks for reading and please check back in a couple of weeks after I return and upload the tales and images from the ride.   
Accommodations:  Patapsco Valley State Park campground    Dj vu when I left the house this morning at 10:20.  Almost everything I did the same as I did eleven months ago when I ventured off to New Orleans.  The photo ops were the same.  The dog was equally sad.  The clothing and equipment were almost completely identical.  The excitement in my chest was there but not as pronounced as it was last year.  This time I knew what I was up against.  This time I was in better shape.  And sadly, this time I wouldn't be going as long.  Actually, my trip will be a mere fraction of what it was last year.  I learned, however, from last year that the trip isn't about mileage or the destination - it's about the journey.  So, I stayed away from self-deprecation about the wimpiness of this puny little ride and instead concentrated on having fun.  You could say I wanted to stop and smell the roses a little more often.      The first few miles of the ride took me past two of my alma maters, Cooper Intermediate and Langley High Schools, and then shortly thereafter, the George Bush Center for Intelligence (insert joke here)(actually it's named after George H. Bush)(a.k.a. the C.I.A.).  I crossed the Potomac River on Chain Bridge into the far western corner of the District of Columbia where I cruised on the sidewalk past motorists stuck in traffic.  I rode on the C & O Canal Towpath for a tiny bit before gaining access to the Capital Crescent Trail at the railroad trestle over Canal Road.  As I rode the 10 or so miles clockwise around the city, I made sure to stop and read the historic markers and kiosks (thus sticking to my policy, with a name I just devised, of 'smelling the roses and whatnot'), although I must have been looking the other way when I past the 'Welcome to Montgomery County, Maryland' sign (which I know exists 'cause I've seen it before).  So, unfortunately, no Maryland sign and not surprisingly no D.C. sign (there aren't many of them anyway).    Towards the end of the Capital Crescent Trail I had some trouble following the signs and got myself lost in Rock Creek Park and later on the campus of Walter Reed Army Medical Center.  I asked an MP for directions to Georgia Avenue, and the young lady in fatigues happily obliged following her instructions with a loud 'sir!' I crossed under the Capital Beltway on Georgia Avenue under the hot early-afternoon sun.  I was happy to be unlost and my legs and body for the first time of the trip were buzzing well.  Sometimes it takes a few hours to get into a ride - not surprisingly today wasn't an exception.  About a mile later I found the Sligo Creek Trail, a shady path that runs six miles from D.C. to Wheaton, Maryland.  I rode on it through Kemp Mill where a Giant (no, not a record store) sat adjacent to the trail.  Although I was feeling well, I knew I should stop.  Grocery stores really are the key to healthy bike touring.  No triangle sandwich here, just some soup, chips, yogurt, and a lot of cantaloupe.  My afternoon was pretty basic and a little frustrating.  I had a lot of trouble navigating through the wiles of suburban Maryland, although it did get a little bit easier with each mile I put between myself and the District.  Suburban landscapes are rife with unmarked 'No Outlets' and 'Dead Ends.'  Moreover, the main roads aren't always labeled on my atlas and the GPS serves little purpose pinpointing my location on the atlas, because the area is so dense that when I look on the map I could be on any one of three or four different 'lines' (signifying, of course, roads).  So, the compass came in handy, and I tried my best to be going north and/or east at all times.  Eventually, that tactic worked to get me on the more farm-like (used very loosely) roads southwest of Baltimore.    Around five or so I rode through a gem of a town, Ellicott City.  I, unfortunately, know nothing about the place, but I am sure to visit again and spend an entire day exploring.  Ellicott City bears the closest resemblance to a European town I have ever seen here in the U.S. (although my memory databank is churning - 'Does Ellicott City deserve superlative status?' I ask myself - I'll continue to think back to places I've visited).  The hills are steep and the roads narrow in Ellicott City.  The storefronts are stoic stone structures, and the railroad museum beckons me back for a look-see (it was closed when I rode through town).  Ohh yeah, one more plus:  New Cut Road, south of town, when traveled northward into the valley which is Ellicott City (elevation 10 feet), is a kick-butt windy, (mostly down)hilly three-mile road great for riding.   More information on Ellicott City from a posting in my Guestbook. I found my way to my campsite, #436, in Patapsco Valley State Park.  I made my reservation two days prior via the internet at the Maryland Department of Natural Resources web site. The park had plenty of tent campers (only compared to other camping experiences) but still a ton of open spaces.  Unfortunately, my site was adjacent to an occupied site, #435.  The people weren't in their the tent when I pulled up, but I figured I should try to move - to afford privacy to both sites and the ability to get a good night's sleep.  I got on my cell phone and called the 800 number to request to be moved to a vacant site three down, #439.  The agent on the phone told me that I would be charged another 12 dollars for canceling my reservation and rebooking a new one.  I pleaded with her, saying that I was just trying to be polite and not aggravate my neighbors when I get up early in the morning and pack up.  'Sorry,' she said, 'I don't make the rules.'  It's strange, here I am in the semi-wilderness (I say 'semi' because I can hear the buzzing of U.S. Rte. 40 in the background, and I have the knowledge that Camden Yards in Baltimore is no more than twelve miles away), and although I see an empty site (even the agent told me that it wasn't reserved for the night), I won't take it because I don't want to get in trouble with a ranger and/or be charged an extra 12 dollars.  Frankly, I was kinda pissed.   Only two minutes after hanging up with the agent, a ranger drove by.  I put my hand up requesting him to stop, and I stated my request.  Actually, I stated it so that it wasn't a request, but more of a favor for my fellow campers.  He was very understanding.  He asked for my cell phone number, because he said he'd call me back after he drove back to the office and checked this out in the computer.  We talked for another minute or two about my travels then he took off, promising me he'd call soon with a determination:  either to stay or to move.  So, I sat and bided my time by eating, stretching, map reading, taking a photo, etc.  As ten minutes stretched into twenty, it started to rain.  First lightly, but as twenty minutes became thirty minutes, it started to pour.  I was in a bind about where my place of rest would be for the evening:  site #436 or site #439.  I just started to set up where I was - everything was getting soaked and I couldn't wait any longer.  Ten more minutes later the phone rang, I answered it in the pouring rain with tent stakes in hand.  'Matthew' the voice on the phone said, 'I'm having some computer problems here, and I've been on the phone with the tech people.  Do you just want to stay where you are?'  By this time I was nearly finished setting up, so I answered, 'yes,' and thanked him for his help.  So, the moral of this story Technology is great, but it shouldn't supersede the decision-making ability of qualified frontline employees - because technology will fail - a ranger won't on an issue such as mine.  Maryland Department of Natural Resources:  please heed!      I rode back out to 40, waiting 15 minutes en route in a pavilion to wait out the most violent part of the thunderstorm.  On 40 I rode another five minutes to a Subway which I had spotted on the way to the park, and in retrospect where I should have just stopped on the way to the park in the first place.  I bought a USA Today and enjoyed my sandwich in the store.  On the short ride back I did experience a problem with the bike:  As I turned the pedals, at about 10 o'clock through the revolution my left crankarm would just give way and freely fall to about 7 o'clock.  I couldn't figure out if it was something with my left pedal or something with the crankarm itself (which was new and installed by me very recently).  This problem worried me, but frankly there was nothing I could do about it at the time.   Back at the tent I sopped up the water inside with my newspaper, read my Outside magazine, and wrote in my journal:  'Never fully got in groove.  But last year I didn't either on day one.  Tomorrow will be better.'
Accommodations:  Lums Pond State Park campground    I didn't wake up early after all; I awoke at nine, and lay in my sleeping bag fighting off the day for a half hour.  I shouldn't have complained, I fell asleep at 10:30 the night before.  More sleep is needed on the road, but I should have been content with ten and a half hours.  Nonetheless, I got going and my morning ritual of breaking camp, packing the rig, and performing a little bit of preventive maintenance took the usual 90+ minutes.  Within a couple of miles on the road, I noticed a bike shop, so I stopped in to see what kind of opinion I could get on my drivetrain problem.  I was told that it was most likely the pedal that was causing the problem in that it was old and tattered and literally falling apart.  I was told that eventually it would fall apart.  At the time I believed the diagnosis, especially because the problem is solely on the left side.  The price was very right, $40, on the most inexpensive set of SPD pedals.  I purchased them, and packed them away - I'll do some roadside surgery, if necessary, later on.  But, for now I'll try to get the rig to Dewey in one piece.  Adjacent to the bike shop was a Denny's and a Grand Slam breakfast was way too tempting after my lackluster tentside breakfast of a Balance bar and a Clif bar.  I went for the ultimate breakfast choice, The Lumberjack Slam, which was probably a little too much for me.  But, I took a good half-hour to eat as I sat at the counter, relaxing and reading my USA Today.  In the end, I slammed everything but one of the sausage patties.  By 12:40 I was back on the road -- much later than I would normally want to get my day going, but really there was no rush.   My original route called for riding around Baltimore, even though cutting straight through was at least 10 miles shorter.  While I sat waiting for the ranger to call me back last night, I did some calculations and concluded that I should cut straight through town.  Going through a big city has its advantages and disadvantages.  In this case the advantages were that I was cutting off a significant amount of time from semi-circumnavigating Baltimore, the scenery is different, and the people-watching potential is much higher.  The downsides of riding through a city, particularly U.S. 40 through Baltimore are that roads can quickly turn into expressways (which happened in this case, but fortunately, I had no problem as it was quite empty in the early afternoon) and that roads can take you through areas that have a significant potential for bike-jacking.   My experience in Baltimore was amenable, and I suffered no significant problems.  At one stop-light in a rougher section of town, in fact, I was questioned by a fellow in a truck next to me about my 'rims' and how much they cost.  I (believe it or not, have been asked this before - multiple times in downtown New Orleans alone) gave (and always give) a low-ball figure, 'a couple hundred.'  This interrogation was short and it gave the individual an opportunity to talk about his ride:  ' a five hundred dollar bike with Rock-Shox.'  I kept the attention on him with follow-up questions about how often and where he rode it.  The light turned green in the middle of one of his responses and his buddy, who was driving, sped off.  My acquaintance stuck his head out the passenger-side window and looked back at me and kept talking (shouting).  I just gave him a thumbs-up, and he eventually stopped moving his lips and instead just smiled. In Aberdeen U.S. 40 parallels the Amtrak Northeast Corridor train tracks.  And along one stretch the only thing that separates the road and the railroad is about a twenty-foot deep thicket of trees.  I pulled off the road and through an access road (really just gravel) to the train tracks.  Strangely enough, this stretch of rail is a rarity in that it is not protected on either side by a chain link fence as it is through Northeast D.C. along New York Ave, or through states up north like Rhode Island.  Nonetheless, I cautiously took advantage of this freedom to get close to the United States' fastest land transportation medium -- I leaned the rig up against a signal box and waited.  I didn't have to wait long for a train to come from around the bend (approximately a quarter-mile away).  A Northbound Acela came my way at over 100mph, and got by me so quickly that I didn't even have a chance to steady my camera on it.  As the train passed the engineer gave me a little toot of the horn.  I am fairly certain that it was a friendly toot, in that it was short, and I think that the engineer didn't perceive me to be a nuisance or a potential suicide (it does happen).  If so he would have instead given me a long, 'Get the hell outta here' blast.  In the span of fifteen minutes a total of three Acelas passed me by - all so quickly that I couldn't get a good shot of them.  A static photo wouldn't have done them justice anyway. I rode along U.S. 40 for about 60 miles today, and I was surprised by the large number of seedy-looking strip clubs, XXX shops, etc.  It seemed like between Baltimore and the Delaware state line I passed by at least five places, all of which, even more strangely, were on the south side of the road.  Maybe it's some funky zoning regulation. I pulled near to Havre De Grace around 4:45pm and decided to take a detour through town.  Havre De Grace sits at the mouth of the Susquehanna River almost at the northern-most tip of the Chesapeake Bay.  It's just at water level so the railroad and highway bridges that cross the river there jump from the palisades on either bank out high over the town, thus providing a picturesque backdrop for the otherwise peaceful village that had a strong sailing and fishing aura to it.  I didn't stay in Havre De Grace long, but I knew that I wanted to go back to this Maryland gem, and spend some time walking around and looking at the historic homes and gleaming waterfront.    At the corner of the small road leading out of Havre de Grace and US 40 was a McDonald's.  I stopped in for a small meal -- something to tide me over for the rest of the afternoon.  Soon I was back on the bike heading northeast to cross the Susquehanna River.  As I rode down a small hill to the base of the bridge my roadway got narrower and narrower -- first losing a lane, then the shoulder, and then elbow room in my lane.  And just as I was about to cross the expansion joint of the bridge I saw a small sign to the side of the roadway:  "Bicyclists and Pedestrians Prohibited."  I let out an expletive, pulled on the brakes, and jumped the Jersey wall with the rig to a small pedestrian walkway.  I pulled out my map and evaluated my options.  It was 20 miles out of my way to ride upriver to the Route 1 bridge and cross there, and I wasn't sure if I could even cross there.  I was a little frustrated and frankly surprised -- after riding throughout the Southeast where I steered clear of Interstates, just as I have done here, so as to not have to deal with bridges that have bicycle prohibitions.   The only sensible option was to attempt to catch a ride over the bridge.  I walked the rig away from the foot of the bridge towards an intersection.  There I pulled out my notepad and Bic ballpoint pen and started scripting a sign.  As I was bold-facing my third grade handwriting, I heard a deep male voice, "You need any help?"    "I'm trying to get across the bridge. I didn't know that bikes weren't allowed on it," I responded to the man as he now stood in front of me.  I was so engrossed in my sign-making that I hadn't noticed that this man had pulled his blue Ford Escort station wagon (with a bike rack on the hatch -- KEY) off to the side of the road.  Without hesitation he offered a ride.  I walked the rig over to the vehicle and with a little bit of teamwork we were able to quickly strip the packs off and throw the bike on the back.  Beryl was my helper's name.  He threw the week's worth of mail that had accumulated on the front seat into the back on the floor.  I took a seat in the Escort, and we were off over the Susquehanna.  I offered to pay the toll on the far end of the bridge.  He declined, because he had paid a flat fee to have a pass to get over the bridge which was really a large UPC bar code-like-sticker on the rear driver-side window.  We drove past the toll booth at a slow speed and a large laser gun positioned at a preset height scanned the sticker -- kinda neat.  I learned that Beryl was on the way to a minor league baseball game with his "gal" (a.k.a. girlfriend) at the new Cal Ripken Jr. Stadium in Aberdeen.  We chatted about a bunch of things in our five minute river-crossing, including Beryl's own bicycling adventures. Once on the northside of the Susquehanna River Beryl offered to take me, "up the road a ways," but I declined.  I courteously asked him to drop me off at the first gas station on the right sign, and he obliged.  We said our good-byes, and I wrote my website address on one of the envelopes in the big stash of mail on the floor.  Although he said he didn't have internet access, he did say that his gal's a teacher, so maybe she'd check the site out sometime at her work.  [Beryl's Gal:  Tell him thanks again for me, please!] It was about six o'clock when I saddled back up after my two mile cheat over the Susquehanna.  It was about 15 miles or so to the Delaware state line and an additional five to the campground.  The first hour on US 40 was pretty basic, but right before I crossed into Delaware on US 40 I took a right turn to the south on Malonry Road outside Elkton, thus prolonging my time in Maryland.  The route to the campground via backroads looked promising, so I decided to go for an adventure and get off the boring US 40.  Malonry Road and its connecting roads proved to be perfect:  windy roads, in and out of stands of trees, in and out cornfields, and then into the state of Delaware.      It was now the hour before sunset, and although the campground was no more than three miles away, I couldn't get to it -- I was stuck in the suburban sprawl of Newark, Delaware (Yeah, can you believe it!?!  Even Delaware has sprawl).  I could have gotten frustrated because my map didn't have the names of the streets that have been laid on what was recently a cornfield, but it didn't seem to matter.  A compass and a little bit of sunlight was all I needed.  I was in a great mood -- the day had given me many things to enjoy, and this mini-quandry wasn't going to ruin it.   Okay, so I made it to the state park.  The campground was a simple loop roadway with perhaps 50 sites on it.  Surprisingly, at least half of them were occupied.  I choose one not too far from the entrance and not too far from the bathhouse.  The rest of the day was nice and relaxing even though I didn't catch any dinner on the way to the campground (previously purchased beef jerky, snack mix, and balance bars had to do).  After a shower and some phone calls, I easily drifted off to sleep to the sounds of muted campfire conversations.
   After a wonderful night of sleep, I awoke at 6:30, and after a quick photo of my campsite I was on my way by eight.  The weather was perfect - cool, sunny, and with a nice breeze at my back.  Five miles into my ride I visited the Delaware Veterans Memorial Cemetery and then crossed the Chesapeake and Delaware Canal at Summit Bridge.        Passing many bicyclists and many more fields of corn I floated down US 301 at an easy 19mph.  The morning wasn't eventful, but that's fine by me, because it was perfect.  The air was at that point where sweat resided on my skin for a short time before it evaporated and provided me with a pleasant chill.  I made a quick pit stop in a grocery store in Middletown for a more substantial breakfast:  OJ, a bagel, yogurt, and a banana.     Then back on the bike to navigate through windy, shady, and scenic roads in and out of the many tracts of the Blackbird State Forest northwest of the state capital.   Connecting current events with the real world:  As I rode through the late morning in the Delaware countryside I followed one particular mail car as its driver was doing his Saturday route.  As he pulled to the side of the road I would pass him, and then he would speed past me to the next house down the road.  As we continued this trade-off a handful of times I observed many residents (all elderly) walking out to their mail boxes immediately after the post man delivered.  What seems to most as an inconsequential routine, mail delivery is extra important to those that spend most of their days at home, inside.  It is their connection to the outside world.  The Postal Service has been toying with the idea of nixing Saturday delivery so as to save money.  And although I understand the Service's reasons, this connection to the outside world is so important for many people and worth holding on to.  Well, anyway... I stopped for lunch in Pearsons Corner at a general store/deli.  I ate outside on a bench and watched the Amish stop by in their buggies to do some shopping.  I bought a cantaloupe at a nearby stand from a young boy whose older brother had just earlier delivered the produce via buggy.  I wasn't familiar with the Delaware Amish, but I enjoyed my few experiences with them.    Back at home my curiosity has gotten to me about my Delaware Amish encounters.  Some cursory online searching has yielded some pretty good results -- some Delaware-specific, some not: Great general info clearinghouse:Amish Links OpiumMagazine.com article:  Amish in the First State State of Delaware sites:State Agencies Unveil New Roadway Sign Project to Increase Safety of Amish Community (PDF file)Safe Driving in Delaware's Amish Community (PDF file) The temps were in the nineties, but I made it through the day just fine.  In fact, the day went great, and I now think that Delaware is my favorite cycling state.  It's relatively flat, rural, green (very green), has windy roads, and plentiful and accurate signs.  The Amish were icing on the cake.  I know I've only ridden in twelve states and the District of Columbia in my short life, but my little over one day of time spent in Delaware has won me over.  I will be back. I rolled down Route One into Rehobeth Beach.  I was amazed how the commercial section of the beach has crept farther and farther out from the beach.  I hadn't been there for five or so years but many things had changed -- more traffic, more stores, more pavement.  All annoying.  But, some things are still the same:  Dr. Habib Bolourchi, Certified Cardiologist, still strangely has his office on the roadside outside Rehobeth and the Jolly Trolley still makes its appointed rounds in Dewey and Rehobeth.    I made it to my brother and sister-in-law's rented beach house, hugged Gail, and then went for a dip in the ocean.  All in all a great trip.

  My inspiration for this tour came--as it often does--from a map.  All travelers know the syndrome: we innocently open a map, and soon we are lost, picking out routes, wondering what that pass is like, where the best camps can be found, what are the views from that hill?  While studying a map of southern California, I discovered that it would be possible to ride a huge loop starting and finishing at our home in Tehachapi, at the very southern tip of the Sierras, that would include some of the best terrain of the Mojave desert, especially the East Mojave Preserve and Death Valley National Park.  Moreover, the majority of the route would follow remote, lightly traveled roads, including a long stretch of the famous Route 66.  When pondering what to do for a winter vacation, I suggested this tour.  My wife, Jodi, agreed.  So the project was launched. For many days before departure, we constantly checked the weather forecasts.  After a week of changeable conditions--snow, wind, sun--things finally cleared.  We canceled our backup plan and got packing. We were both pretty anxious the night before setting sail.  Over 600 miles through remote desert country is a big undertaking.  Could we pull it off?  What would the wind be like?  This was winter, after all, and much of the Mojave is high, cold, and lonesome.  These challenges were part of the game, however; the trip would lose its meaning without them.  So, like excited children, we went to bed. (Note: For those interested in a discussion of our equipment, see my Arizona Trike Tour account and look under "Equipment.") 
     It was hard to believe that we were really, finally, actually started, rolling down our familiar hill, the trike loaded and two weeks of open road stretched out before us.  Suddenly, we were the richest people on earth. A cold, snappy headwind set in quickly.  Toes went numb, fingers, too.  We pushed on to the first pass of the trip: Willow Springs at about 4,700 ft.  Snow clung in patches beneath the spinning wind turbines.      The Tehachapi area produces the world's largest amount of wind-generated electricity, and these turbines are part of many views in the area.  I've always liked them with their elegant spinning blades, some as long as thirty feet each.  The pass, which Padre Garces used back in the 16th century, marked the start of a fantastic ten mile descent into the town of Mojave, home to high winds, burger joints, and aerospace development.  We plunged deliriously into the high desert, the folded, furrowed mountainsides and bajadas covered in Joshua trees, creosote bushes and the occasional juniper.  Mile after mile, we pedaled and descended.  We outwitted the actual town and traffic by using secondary roads and eventually hooked up to Sierra Highway--a straight shot of many miles into Lancaster on the far side of the Antelope Valley. The road was good and traffic generally light.  The scenery--fantastic up high--lost some of its luster but did present us with "classic" desert scenes:  rusting cars, houses composting into the blow sand, doublewides with peeling paint, barking junk-yard dogs behind chain-link fences.  One "church" of note: A converted mobile home with some hack, spray-painted, graffiti-style version of an Hieronymous Bosch depiction of hell: the souls of the damned tormented by the fires of hell, all in crude outlines of black in red flames! The snow-covered peaks receded, and the endless plains of creosote, burro bush and their ilk embraced our route, led us on, vanishing against the San Gabriel mountains in the distance. In Lancaster, a sprawl of homes and a mauling of malls, we stopped at Gil's Bike Shop, in business since 1957.  These nice people sold us some back-up replacement spokes.  One fellow gave us directions to the grocery store but commented that the street was very "hoody," as he put it.  We swung onto this street, half expecting shot-gun shacks and gang banger types.  Instead, nicely maintained homes and children playing confronted us.  We rode into a "gang" of seven to twelve-year-olds who exclaimed "Wow! "Tight bike!"  "Cool!"  For a hundred yards or so we had a yelling, screaming escort of children, some running, others on "razor" scooters or BMX bikes.  Simply delightful. Outside the health food store, I met a friendly man, a vegan Seventh Day Adventist, who was convinced that the milk supply NATION WIDE was contaminated by human sperm: "It's been factuated!" he declared.  As we were discussing the relative merits of vegetarianism, my wife returned with a few supplies, including a pint of half-and-half for the coffee.  The man just smiled and didn't say a word. Because of a lack of campgrounds (and a fairly large gang presence, moved north from L.A.), we were forced to get a motel.  Somehow we managed to wedge our 11 1/2 foot long trike into the room.     Nice hot showers, washing a few clothes and a mediocre meal were the order of the evening.  Tomorrow, we would head due east for many miles on dead straight back roads to connect with Route 66 where, no doubt, we would get our kicks. 
   Some of these "classic" structures were obviously fake, like the gas station and, perhaps, the "Last Chance" motel.  These seemed to be constructed or converted for the movie industry--who knows?  The roads were lightly traveled, the winds mild, and parts of the route were quite beautiful with granite crags and boulders and Joshua trees.  In spite of the mind-numbing straightness of the route, I enjoyed most of the day. Just as we rolled into Adelanto, winds from the predicted weather front began kicking in--pretty fierce 30--40 mph gusts that sometimes pushed the trike off course.  The day was getting old, and gray clouds bore down upon the mountains.  My anxiety level notched up a bit.  Where would we stay?  We attempted to get a spot at an RV park ($25!), but no tents were allowed.  Humph.  A pox on them and the Winnebago they rode in on.  So with the wind beating across our path, we pushed on for Route 66 as the sun faded into the brooding clouds. After a fight with raging cross winds and terrible pavement (more like raunchy cobblestones) we turned onto Rt.66.  In less than a mile we came upon a wonderful "Nature Park" set amid granite boulders and dropping down to the Mojave river, which actually has water here.  We pushed the trike under the locked gate and rolled down to a grassy patch and children's playground.      Jodi, rightly worried about the sprinklers, suggested we pitch the tent in the sand of the jungle gym area--perfect.  A fine dinner of polenta, sauted onions and green beans, kale and cheese set our hunger to rights.  This was made perfect by a cup of fine Syrah we'd carried from home. Soon, however, we realized our good fortune was not without its problems.  Every few minutes, a massive train would grind, squeal and groan its way through the narrow, stony canyon, the din echoing and vibrating in our very bones.  Earplugs helped a little, but sleep was to be a rare condition for most of the night.  We did some reading and got what rest we could.  Oh, well, guess we can't have everything. 
  The night was not good, so we were happy to be out of the place, even though it was beautiful, especially after the rain that fell for about half the night.  We awoke to clear skies, however, and chilly temps.  We would find that most mornings would be in the mid 30's.      We brewed up some coffee and set out as soon as we were warm enough to move.  Groggy and frazzled, we headed northward on Route 66 for a stretch and finally east to Barstow. The morning was cut from fine crystal and a biting wind, which would soon be a tailwind--heh, heh.  We stopped for a moment to take pictures of a bottle-tree garden, another strange, delightful desert artifact.  In these dry regions, some people just feel free to express themselves in unexpected ways.    Shortly after the bottle forest, I heard an odd rattling and looked down to see one of the fender mounts broken clean through.  Arrgh.  We pulled over and quickly had the offending unit fixed with the timeless standbys:  duct tape and bailing wire.  No kit would be complete without them.      At a little store shortly down the road, I could tell that Jodi wasn't feeling too well.  I didn't push with many questions, but when she gets that "look" and is strangely quiet, I know something's brewing. We set off for a wide-open section of the highway that dropped at a mild angle down towards Barstow.  The sky scrubbed clean, a ripping wind at our backs, we fairly flew--30+mph for miles.  A glorious run.  We coasted into Barstow, and when we stopped, we really understood how strong the winds were.  Flags were STARCHED.  People walked uncertainly with heads down.  We resupplied quickly and headed out, hoping for a better camping situation.  We were not to find it. After being told that part of Route 66 was now a military base, we had to get on Hwy 40 for a few miles.  We ended up in a tight spot for camping, just nowhere to go.  So, in desperation, we crossed to Hwy 15 in search of a KOA.  The way was blocked, however, by a ground-level sand storm, an opaque sand blaster cutting across our route just a foot or two above the pavement-- perfect for a low-slung recumbent trike.  We shielded our faces with our hands and pedaled quickly through.      The KOA was the expected nightmare: Hard on the highway, choked with generator buzzing RV's.  Hot showers helped, but I could tell that Jodi's mood was not improving.  She was in a serious tailspin, and there was nothing I could do about it.  She wandered off for some time--not a good sign.  At long last, she returned and disappeared in the tent.  Despite the wind, I was hungry and decided to make myself a simplified dinner while I brooded over Jodi's brooding.  After messing with the stove for some time in the dim light of my headlamp, Jodi emerged and began helping me with the preparations.  We finally got to talking about what was eating at her.  She was tired, hated the camping, regretted coming on the trip and thought bicycle touring was a big mistake.  Then she really lost it, broke into uncontrolled tears, a total knock-down, drag-out melt down.  Any attempt I made to reason with her resulted in just more tears.  I was feeling terrible.  I just figured some bad days were part of the mix, things you had to work through to find the gems, but Jodi....  I just wasn't sure what to do.  I could see that she wasn't getting out of the trip what I was.   "Jodi," I said, "we can end the tour, ride back to Barstow, rent a car or truck and just go home." "I'm not quitting!" she replied through her gasps. "But what's the point if you're this miserable?" "It'll get better!  I want to finish this." Feeling pretty confused and uncertain about the future, we ate a quiet meal with a bit of "damn-it-all" aka wine, and crawled into the tent as the winds died.  The next day we'd be out in the wild desert, away from KOA's and busy highways. Despite the noise, we slept better than we expected. Maybe things would be better. From the Stoker's Corner:  Scott never really asked me what was brewing within; he simply got quiet, no doubt hoping it would go away.  And who can blame him?  I wanted that, too.  But I was exhausted.  Christmas events had tired me out more than I realized, and coupled with an ongoing lack of sleep, the fatigue was taking its toll (it wasn't hormones--this time).  But the real clincher for me was that, while the cycling and scenery were mostly just fine, I was feeling blasted by noise:  cars and RV's out for the holidays; city traffic; hotel noises.  Our usual winter trips involve heading quickly out to remote areas in our camper for many days of hiking and/or climbing, with plenty of time for quiet relaxation.  I wasn't getting it.  I was overwhelmed.  And ending up at a KOA seemed absolutely absurd and completely depressing.  But what Scott has trouble comprehending, even after 15 years together, is that when I cry, it never means the world as we know it is coming to an end, it's simply a release of pent-up tension.  Then I can get to an emotional place where I'm able to make a decision that's workable for me.  My decision to keep going had less to do with being stubborn or simply committed to finishing what I'd started, but rather that I knew that things were about to get dramatically better once we hit the more remote desert regions.  And they did. 
  Apologies to Thomas Paine, but the pavement on this stretch tried everything.  The day started well enough.  After some excellent coffee and a chilly start, the day warmed, and we made good time to Newberry Springs and the famous "Bagdad" Cafe, the very place featured in the film of the same name.      We met an old desert denizen fascinated by our trike.  He claimed himself an inventor of a four-seater bike but admitted he'd never built any of his inventions.  Other folks gawked and pointed.  The trike sure worked to bring out all kinds of people wherever we stopped. I had to eat something at this famous cafe.  We read the visitors book while I ate some pancakes, homefries and orange juice.  The book was packed with entries by people from all over the planet, especially Europeans and Asians.  Apparently the Euro's love to visit the desert--in the summer!  I'd heard this before.  Lots of Germans especially.  They flood into Death Valley and other spots when the rest of humanity stays away.  We found one entry by an Iranian who joked that the place should be called the "Tehran Cafe" and followed his English with an entry in Farsi--a beautiful, flowing script. After spending too much time at this landmark, we pedaled down Rt. 66.  Brown mountains, sand, and a fantastic flow of basalt extended into the clear air.  The day warmed nicely.  But the promise of cycling ecstasy was not to be.  Shortly after leaving the cafe, rough seas began pounding the Good Ship Greenspeed (Greenspeed is the brand name of our trike).  Route 66 quickly became the devil's highway, el camino del diablo, Route 666!  We hit the worst pavement of my life, about thirty or forty miles of it.  Rutted, split, cracked, bulging, blasted, blighted, crumbled, crusty, corroded black top led off into the distance--forever.        We struggled and bounced and jolted our way along.  The day was beautifully warm, but the pavement soured my mood a bit.  At one point, a long descent, which should have been a fantastic drop, became a spirit-thrashing ordeal.  I just had to pull over to recover for a few minutes.  Jodi, with the shock-dampening load on the panniers, was not having such a bad time.  I just hung my head and wished it were over.  With virtually no traffic and the wonderful weather, Jodi's mood had turned 180 degrees.  We were determined to continue. At long last, we rolled into Ludlow, a road-side stop with a little cafe and a couple of gas stations/mini marts.  We purchased water and set off again, planning on getting clear of Hwy. 40, which Rt. 66 had paralleled, and rail road tracks.  Our track, however, was as bad as ever.  More rough pavement. As the sun fell low in the sky, we pulled off on a dirt road and made camp.  Thankfully, we were far from tracks and highway barely audible in the distance.  We drank in the view of mountain range upon dessicated mountain range as the colors shifted from yellow and gold to azure and lavender and the deepening shadows of dusk. A second day of minor knee pain worried me.  My biggest fear for this tour, now that Jodi seemed to be back in the swing, was that my body would give out.  Retreat from some of these distant locations would not be easy.  I did okay today, but the knee.  Maybe fewer miles the next day. We were feeling pretty extended, remote.  The feelings we were searching for.  The best riding was still to come. 
  This was a great, frustrating, strenuous day.  We had a glorious sunrise outside of Ludlow, did a few repairs (the other fender!), and finally set off about 9:30am.   The terrible pavement finally relented, and we rode on acceptable if sometimes rough surfaces until Amboy.  As we descended further into this remote basin, I began to feel really "out there."  At times we would ride for a full half hour without seeing a car.      Dusty brown bajadas tilted for miles up to furrowed volcanic peaks--the Bristol Mtns. to the north, the Bullion Mtns. to the south--mountains of brown, burnt umber, beige, dun, tawny sands, and all of it capped by a brilliant blue sky.  Except for the road and train tracks to the north, the works of man were not to be seen, just raw, vast distances, peaks, ranges and basins fifty, sixty, seventy miles distant.  We pedaled steadily through this strange, forbidding landscape.  To be honest, however, it was precisely this powerful confluence of the internal and external landscapes that I hoped to find. My worries, besides the anxiety brought on by our remote location, mostly concerned my knee; it bothered me off and on throughout the ride.  Just had to keep going.    Amboy was as dismal as I remembered it, a decaying blister of a town, a place where crimes happen but are never reported.  The population listed on the road sign claimed twenty people as residents.  We met a local, however, who said the true figure was closer to seven.  We finally got some water from Roy at Roy's cafe, which was depressingly empty.  He cautioned us against the water and said we could procure some about ten miles up the road--spoken like a true driver of an automobile.  These exchanges were all most difficult as his English was heavily mangled by his still fresh Hispanic roots.  He did have pint bottles of water, but not enough for our purposes, especially at $1.50 each.  Finally, he said that some people drink the local water.  He reluctantly filled our container.  I bought a $2 ice cream cone by way of thanks. We set about cooking up a meal just across from the cafe and made a discovery: the stove was now useless.  Jodi had left behind the connecting hose back at last night's camp.  After a bit of fuming on my part, Jodi hit on the idea of ordering a new stove from REI and having it shipped to Death Valley.  We'd just eat cold or eat out until we got there.  Sigh...the travails of the trails test us mightily: no morning coffee!  We could perhaps make fires, but I doubted we'd take the time, and, this being the Mojave desert, there often wasn't much to burn.  We ate our cold lunch and set out.  The riding at first was fantastic, the sun warm.  We reveled in jagged mountains and clear light.  Then came the Kelbaker grade. At first we climbed fairly quickly, hammering out a steady 7 mph.  Although not very steep, the route is relentless, making up for lack of severe incline with mile after mile after mile of distance.  With one brief reprieve, we'd climb this hill for twenty-five miles.  My knee kept me anxious, and the climbing and unrelenting straightness of the road wore us down.  Distant objects seemed to never get any closer--grind, grind, sweat, grind, sweat and go no where.  But hills do submit, Sisyphus triumphs if even momentarily.  We made camp on a dirt road not far off the main route, pitching the tent in the gathering dark. My knees were sore, especially the left one.  We decided  to add a link to my chain to extend the pedals.  This would prove to be a big mistake, but at the time it seemed the most reasonable thing to do.  I've since learned to not make big changes to a bike's setup during or just before a long ride.  Regardless, at the time, I felt better.  In general, the riding had been more difficult than we expected.  Because of the cold nights and mornings, we didn't get started until 9am or so, and by 3:30pm, the days were feeling almost over, especially when we had to find and set up camp.   So our new year's eve was spent huddled in a tent as the cold Mojave night closed around us.  We scratched in our journals and spooned down cold beans and salsa, not bad, really.  The next day would see us finishing this climb to Granite Pass at over 4,000 ft.  The East Mojave Preserve also awaited, some of the most spectacular riding of the trip.  I burrowed into my sleeping bag and wondered how all this would turn out. 
     We topped the first pass (Granite Pass) at about 10 am.  It was cold, blustery, but the sky was blue, and the granite peaks and crags that give the pass its name stood out beautifully in the morning light.  We suited up for the huge descent to Kelso station.  This was a good ten mile drop with some of the grandest views imaginable.  The Granite Mountains fell behind while the vista to the west opened on the Kelso Dunes, a mountain range of dunes covering miles of the basin.  To the east jutted the limestone peaks of the Providence Mountains, some of the steepest of the Mojave, soaring thousands of feet above their bases.  Tucked at the bottom of the gradual parabola we rode sat Kelso, an old rail road stop currently being rebuilt by the park service.  It's a classic stucco and tile roof structure that should be a nice place to visit when refurbished.  We had lunch in front of the boarded-up Post Office, got some water from a local, and submitted ourselves once again to the discipline of hill climbing.      At about 3:30 pm, we cracked the last grade and camped near the summit of another pass, once again over 4,000 ft.  With numbing fingers and toes, we pitched the tent in a nice sandy spot beside a Joshua tree, Kelso Peak as our front door view.  Jodi had an idea for a cold tuna/tofu veggie salad...and excellent it was.  I was looking forward to another stove, but we were managing well enough.  The next day, we had a very long descent to Baker, CA., home of the famous "Bun Boy" and the world's tallest thermometer--and a motel room, hot showers, a hot meal, and, perhaps, coffee in the morning. 
  Finally an easy day.  The night before was cold, once again in the 30's in the tent, but the morning was bright and warmed quickly.  Jodi couldn't warm her feet, so I placed them against my chest for a while.  We ate our usual breakfast of almond butter sandwiches.  Covered in layers of extra clothing, we braced ourselves for the long descent into Baker, 25 nearly effortless miles.    As we dropped off the pass, the virtually cloudless sky opened to views of distant peaks, more sand dune wastes, snow-capped peaks on the horizon perhaps a hundred miles away--fantastic. Once we rolled into Baker, got a room, got clean, we were both doing even better.    We had lunch and dinner at a place called The Mad Greek, a crazy-busy place with delightful Greek music bouncing off the walls and a packed stream of people coming and going, and the best thing: espresso!  The road gods were smiling, and so was I.  The food was run-of-the-mill, but I rather enjoyed the friendly chaos of the place, the blue and white paint job, cheap copies of Greek statues and giant posters of idyllic Greek islands.   Our room was clean and large with plenty of room for an 11 1/2 foot long tandem.  We lounged, watched a movie, washed and dried clothes.  In general, we were excited about the next phase of the trip and resolved to get an early start and drink coffee on the road as we pedaled north.  Drinking and driving--what a country. 
With coffee and a greasy ball in my stomach, we rolled out of this enchanting burg shortly after 8am, a record for us on this trip.  The sun at our backs, we pedaled north up Hwy 127 through some awesome desert scenery--light traffic and excellent pavement.  We were in heaven.  We had crossed some line, stepped into a magic time when all is right with the world.  We rode strong and sure, the sun warming, the mountains round us like old friends too long absent.      After about 30 mi. and a low point of 460ft., we finally started to climb steadily, the usual non-stop desert grade for about 12 mi.      We felt strong, and, with a stop for lunch, topped out in a couple of hours.  On the way we passed the turn-off for Dumont Dunes, a vast OHV area.  In the distance, we could see a virtual city of RV's, the hive-center for a swarm of two, three, and four wheel vehicles carried from distant cities and now buzzing about in random confusion.  I was reminded of the old sci-fi movie, Road Warrior. From the top of Ibex Pass, Jodi and I were treated to one of the finest stretches of road we have ever experienced.  A long, gradual decline led down into the Amargosa River valley closed off to the surrounding world by high, layered volcanic mountain ranges and sedimentary peaks and ridges.      To the NE, Tecopa looked green and busy, but we were headed for Shoshone--a good thing, too.  After several miles of rolling through old deposits of the ancient river--gray to white rounded lumps and curving washes--we entered the town.  Besides some sort of government facility and a Catholic church on an alkali hill top, the first thing to greet us was C'est si Bon--Espresso and Internet Cafe--hoooray!  We brake for espresso.  Could life get any better?      It did when we met the proprietor, David.  A warm, friendly man, he gave us a nice place to camp and a delicious strawberry smoothie.  We pitched our tent in a thick grove of tamarisk trees sighing gently in the breeze, overhead a model "tin-man" constructed out of tin cans.      David kept the hospitality flowing with offers of food, a place to shower, a key for access to a bathroom.  All of this in a quiet and quaint little town owned by the same family for over 100 years.  The founder's great grand nephew cooked and served our meal that night in the Crowbar Cafe just down the street from C'est si Bon.   After one of the best veggie burritos we'd ever had, we waddled back to our camp in the tamarisk trees.  Before bed, we got side-tracked by David and talked for a couple of hours in his cafe.  He had closed down shop, so it was just the three of us.  He showed us around.  He had totally rebuilt this old train station, which itself had been moved from a now defunct town a few miles up the road.  It was a comfortable place to sit and talk about our lives and the events of the world.  We lingered over the table in the flickering candle light.  Finally, too tired to keep our eyes open, we dragged ourselves back to our tent in the singing trees.  Tomorrow we faced one of the biggest passes on the route and our entrance into Death Valley National Park.  We were both really excited.  My knees ached some, but they hadn't exploded and only ached a bit when I squatted.  Tomorrow would be a test, Salsberry Pass. 
   We had a long and beautiful climb to the pass.  Cars were so infrequent we often felt the road was built for us alone.  We pushed hard and soon found ourselves bathed in sweat.  From the heat generated on some of the climbs and the chill of some of the nights and mornings, I was starting to call this the "Freeze or Fry" tour.  From the top of the pass, we were treated with one of the great experiences of our lives: the fifteen mile drop into Death Valley. The sensory and emotional flood that this dry landscape evoked in us is hard to describe.  This descent is one of those experiences that, afterward, I can't imagine my life without.  We dropped at a steady but not too quick pace into this massive sink, two hundred miles long and the lowest point in North America: Telescope Peak mantled in snow, alluvial fans, runnels, gullies, canyons, rip-saw ridges and peaks, oceans of air and light opened up to us with each bend of the road.  I gasped, hollered, laughed out loud.  I was shot-through by a giddy light-headedness of pure joy.  The hard climb followed by such a gift, a reward of the quest.  Vast, awesome, unreal, we reveled in the experience and floated into the valley below. We had another brief stretch of rough pavement, but then it improved.  We spun merrily along the ancient shores of the long-gone Lake Manley and submerged ourselves in the golden light of late afternoon.     We thought for a time that we might push on for Furnace Creek, but by 4pm we realized that would necessitate riding in the dark for more than an hour.  Why bother?  We camped off the side of the road, the summit of Telescope Peak over 11,000 ft. above, one of the great mountain walls on the continent.  We pitched camp and watched the moon drop behind the peak, the stars emerge, perfect and sharp.  We drank a fine merlot and attended the best church I've ever known.  Only one car passed as we set up camp; one passed as we were breaking camp.  The night was silent and utterly still. 
  Last night, I didn't sleep much.  It was a bit chilly, and my brain would just not shut down.  Often, I just put on my glasses and scrutinized the stars or brushed away the one fly in a thousand square miles.  We stayed in our bags as long as possible in the 34 deg. shade.  At long last the sun crept down the wall of Telescope peak and reached our bags.  We packed, and with numb toes, started for Furnace Creek. Shortly after starting, however, I knew something was wrong.  My left Achilles tendon was hurting a little.  The soreness increased as we went, inflaming a bad mood, a dark mood of foreboding in the process.  What was this?  Was I to overcome my knees only to be felled by my ankle, my Achilles heel?  I'd felt so strong the day before.  In retrospect, I've learned that I extended the reach to the pedals too far and so aggravated my tendon, a common mistake.  But what were we to do?  I was committed to a rest day at Furnace Creek; maybe that would be enough.  I doubted it.  I know how the tendon game is played. We purchased a few supplies at the little store in Furnace Creek and found a campsite just down the road.  As we were going about our chores, we noticed what appeared at first to be cloud banks drifting across the peaks. To the north, the valley was gone, just obliterated.  But these were not clouds in the sense of water vapor.  They were clouds of dust on the move from we knew not where.  At valley floor, the air was still and clear.  Once the sun started to drop behind the mountains, Jodi and I put on jackets in the chill and headed to the restrooms.  A few yards from camp, we were enveloped in a wash of warm air--so strange!  Then the dust hit.  The winds instantly spiked, carrying with them trillions of tiny dust particles.  We rubbed our eyes and ran back to camp to secure everything.  The omens were gathering.  We weighted and tied everything down and dove for the "shelter" of the tent.  We had something of a windbreak in a stand of tamarisk trees, but still the gale raged much of the night.  And we ate grit.  Ultra-fine powdery grit filtered through the netting and settled onto our bags, into our hair, into our noses, lips, teeth.   Aeolus gave us a sound thrashing that night.  I read Tony Hillerman and watched dust particles filter past my headlamp beam. 
The stove was broken.  More portents.  I'd have to go find some witches to see if Birnam wood had come to Dunsinane!  Fortunately, the stove was still usable.  I brooded some then brewed some.  The coffee was the needed tonic and provided a little chemical optimism.  It was really a great little stove--an MSR Dragonfly. We lounged in the warmth (mid 70's) and talked with people drawn to our strange vehicle while I cleaned the bike and puttered around.  We met the executive chef for the two restaurants in the area, the Furnace Creek Ranch (low end) and Furnace Creek Inn (high end), although everything costs a lot in this remote location.  The chef told us that his previous job had been in Fairbanks, Alaska.  Talk about going from the freezer to the frying pan.  He said that, overall, Death Valley was much more livable.  Jodi got to talk food and nutrition--oh, happy day!  We decided to eat out at the Inn. One problem: The dress code.  Jodi called ahead to see what could be done.  She explained our circumstances and said they could hide us in a remote corner of the restaurant--whatever was needed.  This was a resort where the rooms start at $250 a night, a pretty rarefied atmosphere for these road-ragged cyclists.  Still, the dinner sounded like fun.  The staff said they could accommodate our scruffy selves.  We did shower, however. That evening, we put on our best clothes--exactly what we'd been wearing for the last ten days--strapped the lights onto the trike and pedaled up to the Parthenon a mile up the road.  We rolled up to the elegant stone building at about 6 pm and looked for a valet, but he was elsewhere, his station abandoned.  He must have known we were coming.  We locked the rig up to a railing and ascended to the inner sanctum.  Subdued lighting and rustic yet tasteful furnishings stretched out along the front room.  Acutely aware of the juxtaposition of our less-than-tasteful dinner dress (Jodi looked far better than I) and not really giving a damn, we approached the receptionist's desk.  Prim, proper, prune-ish, the obviously disgusted woman behind the counter could barely contain her contempt.  Jodi said, "We have 6 o'clock reservations for dinner." "Well, you know," she intoned, "there is a dress code."  "Oh, we know, but we called ahead, and they're ready for us."  "Well...all right."  We then unloaded a pannier and seat bag on her and swaggered into the bar.  I ordered a nearly $5 beer and sat down in the lounge with Jodi to wait for the dining room to open.  I was having a blast.  We sipped the beer and watched how the "beautiful" people live.  Pretty nice.  But staying in a place like this would never give us a story of camping in a dust storm.  Such lodgings have their benefits, but I'd never give up the challenges of the road for them.  For a night or two, however?  Hmmm.... The host did indeed seat us in a far corner, which was quite nice with a view on a cactus garden outside.  The host and our server were both interested in our adventures.  The waiter, in fact, was a cyclist himself and so quite sympathetic to our situation.  We had a delectable dinner: two kinds of bread and three kinds of butter, egg plant parmesan for Jodi; for me, grilled Bambi (venison) from New Zealand in a "cherry-berry reduction sauce" with herbed mashed potatoes and asparagus spears.  We sipped merlot and contemplated our adventures.  Dessert was a hot banana chocolate bread with sauteed bananas and intense chocolate ice cream, plus two complementary chocolate truffles that we saved for later.  I drank most of the wine.  Life was just great AND expensive.  Well, what the hell are Platinum cards for, anyway? With a hoot and a holler, we descended from Mt. Olympus, for mere mortals cannot long endure the abode of the gods.   In camp, I contemplated the next day.  I did not have a lot of faith in my ankle, but I was more at peace with whatever would happen.  We would make the run to Stovepipe Wells, and, if my ankle allowed it, start up the grade toward Townes Pass, one of the highest in the park.  Our plan was to camp about halfway up at Emigrant Junction and from there head up to Emigrant Pass, a little higher than Townes but not so steep.  We adjusted the pedals back, so maybe with this and careful pedaling technique, I could make it.  Either way, it had been a great adventure.
  We woke to a perfect morning and headed off into cool, clear desert light.  Soon, however, I could tell that my left ankle was not going to like it.  After a long, gradual climb before a drop to Stovepipe Wells,  I knew it was over.  To continue up Townes Pass would have been foolish in the extreme.  I was not in agony nor did I want or plan to be.  I learned this lesson years before: When tendons talk, listen.  I was, of course, deeply disappointed, and I know that Jodi was feeling our "failure" just as acutely.  We could not ask for better weather or scenery.  We wanted to keep riding forever, for the rest of our lives, to let our remaining days slide from one to the next, a seamless stream of human powered experiences, each day a new place, a new challenge, new people and insights.  But it was over, at least for now.  In the myths of ancient Greeks, the prophesies are never wrong; the portents and signs hold true, and so it was for our little odyssey.  We made our last turn and began the final descent to Stovepipe Wells. After a few yards, however, something felt strange.  The back end of the trike was swaying back and forth, the tail wagging the dog.  What the hell?  Ah, a flat tire, of course, the final nail in the sarcophagus of the journey, the ultimate sign from the road gods that we had reached the end of the line.  The trike and I were one, limping the last miles.  We stopped and fixed the tire.  No wind, bright sun--a nice place for roadside repairs.  A kindly ranger stopped to ask if we needed assistance, but we had things under control.  A few minutes later, we finished our descent. There was nothing to do now but engineer our escape.  We parked in the shade, ate lunch, and worked out a plan.  I would hitchhike to Ridgecrest over a hundred miles away, rent a truck and return for Jodi and the gear.  While I sat out in the warm sun (in the low 80's now), Jodi approached people getting gas.  She succeeded before I did.  There was not much traffic, so I could have been sitting out there for a long time.  Paul and Anita, mid-forties retro hippie types in a mid-80's VW camper, were to be my hosts.  Very nice people, they seemed to have trouble making ANY kind of decision. She wanted to go to Cuba.  They were thinking about going to Bishop and Mammoth but had no concept of the high, snowy passes and generally freezing temperatures they would encounter.  Jodi borrowed a term for people like this: flat-liners.  Finally, they decided that they would go north and could drop me in Lone Pine, a town with a truck rental agency. So at last, I climbed into their camper filled with two dogs, books, balls of yarn, bundles of sage, rocks, crystals, photos of various Eastern gurus, sticks, twigs and general chaos--classic.  We ascended the pass at a startling speed.  I was used to 4mph hill climbing; fifty miles per hour seemed impossible and disconcerting.  I was struck, too, by waves of disappointment again.  I wanted to be doing this on the tandem, Jodi and I using our own strength.  It was going too quickly.  I wanted to go slowly, linger in this dramatic landscape.  But the end was decided now.  I sat back and enjoyed the views and marveled at the power of internal combustion. We crested the Inyo mountains in the late afternoon and were presented with one of the clearest views I've ever had of the Sierras.  Mile upon mile of the snowy jagged crest marked the horizon.  I wished Jodi could see it.  Fifteen minutes before the U-Haul agency closed, I stepped through the doors.  The owner expected me, expected me not to make it.  We worked quickly through the paperwork, and as darkness poured into the Owen's Valley, I began the mountainous drive back into Death Valley.  By seven that night, I was sitting with Jodi in Stovepipe Wells. 
So it's over.  So what?  We learned a hard lesson about adjusting bikes.  We learned, too, about ourselves, our resolve, our strengths and weaknesses.  We learned about the landscape and some of the people.  We learned about sunlight and wind, dust and heat and cold, about warmth and climbing and the wild release of the descent through impossible desert canyons.  We learned that much of life is lived too quickly and that four miles per hour up a never-ending mountain side is just about right.
Enough of this. It's time to get ready and actually start the riding part. Tonight I will finish packing my gear, hope that I have everything, and force the box shut. Tomorrow night it's off to Montreal and an early flight to Vancouver on Tuesday. For those interested, the ride will take me west to east mostly following the Trans Canada highway. My goal is Sydney, but I have to finish by mid October. I'll be solo and camping most of the way. Onward!
I flew out of Montreal at 7:00 AM. My friend Jason picked me up in Vancouver. It was great to see him. We hiked up the Squamish Chief, followed by a sampling of the Howe Sound brewery. We were able to get the obligator photo at the waters edge (didn't dip anything though). It was nice to get to meet his friend Nola for the first time. They are now driving to Ontario for the fall. I'm looking forward to riding with them there. Tomorrow the riding begins!   
I met a couple riding home to Seattle who had ridden through Jasper and Banff parks, then down the more southern path on the return. It's always great to meet others having fun doing this.  The weather has been great so far. I won't say any more so as not to jinx myself.     
I had originally thought I might stop at Lytton, but I decided to go a little further. From Lytton the Trans Canada takes one up the Thompson river. I was amazed at the contrast from the Fraser. The scenery changed from lush high mountains to high desert sagebrush hills. It reminded me a lot of the Sevier valley in Utah. My first wildlife encounter came when I startled a coyote. I almost got caught in the small landslide it started as it scrambled up the hill to get away.     
The weather has been consistantly good. It starts off sunny then clouds over a bit. Next morning it is nice and sunny again. Last night was a little warmer than before. This is a great relief as my sleeping bag is a little light. Tommorrow could be a big day. I may try to ride to Revelstoke. I'll see how I feel.   
Tommorrow is Rogers Pass.       
I'm excited to ride into Yoho and Banff parks tommorrow. It will be my last day really climbing in the mountains. I wonder if Kicking Horse Pass will be like Rogers Pass was today. It's hard to convey how beautiful it is here. It will be sad to leave the mountains.       
Almost imediately out of the campsite I rode past some bighorn sheep. They were curious about me (maybe wondering if I was going to make the pass or not). The ride up through Yoho National Park to Kicking Horse Pass was beautiful. I actually had a bit of a tailwind! It did start to become obvious that I wasn't going to make Banff today. Lake Louise looked like a good option. Upon arrival in Lake Louise I found out that all camping was closed due to bear activity. They said there might be a few tent sites in a special area surrounded by electrical fence. I didn't think that sounded too fun. As room prices in Lake Louise are astronomical I decided that maybe I would ride down to Banff after all. Luckily I met Morgan, a cyclist doing the "Golden Triangle" route. He had stayed at the Castle Mountain Hostel the night before and thought it would have space. This meant only a 30km downhill / flat ride.  The clouds started to give way in the evening. It would be really nice to have a clear day before I leave the park.       
 
So what does someone riding cross-country do on their day off? Rent a mountain bike and go ride a trail of course. I had seen pictures of the Lake Minnewanka trail before and thought it looked nice. It was. For the most part it is a slightly rough singletrack following the lake shore. It was really fun and suprisingly different from my daily riding. The water around here really does have that crazy colour in all the pictures and everywhere you look is a stunning mountain backdrop. Tonight I'll relax a little and head into Calgary tommorrow.     
Maybe the best way to spend a day like this is with friends. Darrell and Alison Jones invited me to stay with them in Bragg Creek. Darrell rode out to meet me coming in from Banff. We had to climb back up into the mountains after descending, but I'll get it all back as downhill! It was a very nice day amidst much rennovation at Darrell and Alisons. We shared a nice lunch, dinner, beers, and a hot tub. 
The riding today was very lonely and boring. I guess I'll get used to it. There will be more of the same for a while. One thing that stood out are the grasshoppers. There are a lot of them all over the road and they are big! Another thing to get used to is the lack of services in some towns.     
Today I awoke to the tailwind I've been waiting for. I made really good time going into Medicine Hat. It's hard to believe how many grasshoppers there are here. I ran my errands in Medicine Hat and struck out for the Saskatchewan border. I met Sebastion, a French cyclist heading west. He had been battling fierce headwinds all across the praries. I felt bad for him, but not so bad that I couldn't secretly celebrate for myself. I reached the border around 4:00. There was an Alberta information centre, but nothing for Saskatchewan. I rode on in with no map. That was my first mistake. Actually my first mistake was believing the Alaberta info staff that the next campground was 50km up the road. I finally got to the Saskatchewan info centre after 40km. It was closed of course. I took the opportunity to steal a small map of the area from their phone book. It did not look promising for a campground in 10km. Eventually 50km further down the road I came to a place to camp. It was maybe a campground (at one time anyway). It did OK for the night. By the way, I did make it before dark.   
 
I started seeing prarie dogs today in addition to the grasshoppers. There are not as many as I might expect. One was standing guard by the side of the road. It was not doing a very good job as I got within ten feet before it seemed to notice me. I almost made it to Moose Jaw, camping about 30km to the west. There were some really nice people I met who gave me some stove fuel.   
I rode on and stayed in a campground in Indian Head. There was laundry here so I was able to get caught up on that. Since today was uneventful it gives me a chance to mention my wife, Susan. She has really supported me in this trip (as she does with everything I do). All of the times it seemed like a lot of trouble to do this she knew how important it was to me and didn't give me the option to back out. She is at home taking care of our house, animals, and finances (with one less paycheck). Every day I call to let her know I'm safe. She brightens my day if it's been bad, and listens with exitement if it's been good. I could not do this without her. I love you Susan.   
Although I don't have too many people to talk to out here I am sure to say hello to all the animals. The horses (and llamas!) seem interested in what I'm up to. They always come running up to the fence from wherever they are. Cattle always listen to what I have to say, but don't seem to grasp it well. There are lots of mosquitos and flies at night whenever I am setting up camp. It is very hard to cook dinner any time after 5:00 or so.     
 
The day started off well. I had the wind at my back and was riding fast. I made it to Brandon a lot faster than I hoped. The weather was perfect and the sun didn't seem as intense as usual. There were hardly any grasshoppers. I got a flat late morning, but it wasn't a big deal - a staple which I didn't see. The problems started around 4:30. I got another flat, this time in the rear tire. I didn't have a new tube anymore so I had to patch one. I used the one from the flat this morning as it would have a very distinct hole from the staple. Everything went well and I was rolling again. Ten minutes later I was losing air already. I pulled the tire off again and re-checked for something causing it. Nothing. I patched up the other tube I had and was on my way again. Not for very long though. Both tubes definitely had slow leaks. Standing on the side of the road in the wind and passing traffic I couldn't find any air escaping (and therefore no place to patch). Did I mention that I fix bikes for a living? Things were starting to look a bit grim, but luckily Tom, who was returning from shuttling a train crew to Brandon, came and offered me a ride to civilization. I ended up in Winnipeg at Olympia Cycle and Ski. They were extremely helpful. I was able to fix myself up, get their advice on Winnipeg, use their pump to make sure I was fully inflated, and use their internet.  Tommorow I will ride toward Ontario, hopefully with the wind at my back and air in my tires.
Outside of Winnipeg I passed the geographical center of Canada. The halfway point of my trip won't come for another few hundred miles. The road today was fairly flat with longer stretches between towns. Approaching the Ontario border one rides through Sandilands forest reserve. It looks like a popular snowmobiling area, but is pretty deserted now. There was a slight headwind today. I outraced a thunderstorm into Falcon Lake. I hope that tomorrow brings clearer skies.     
 




   After tourist info and a sip of water, I was on my way, under the cloudy sky but so humid and tropical air of Auckland. Where I'd go was a problem. I wanted to crash, and fast, and I got indications for the nearest campsite but got it all wrong as I swirled around "round-about" those English like intersections.So confusing when you don't know, and when you are looking at the traffic (even the stirring wheel is on the wrong side of the car!) Well, what a cultural shock to ride on the left side of the road!!! Geez! I felt like I was learning again to ride! But drivers were mostly very friendly and generous with their space and I managed. After 25 km that were supposed to be only 10, I found myself at my first campsite and got acquainted with the other campers, mainly cyclists and backpackers. The campsite is equipped of a full kitchen, all you gotta provide is your pots and utensils. The washrooms are equipped of a hair drier, so much for not bringing my hair spray!!!! :-) (And my make-up)and wahers and driers for laundry. I had a nap and woke up cold, and with the need to go change money and go buy food for dinner. I had lunch with the chocolate bar my sister sent me. Though it was yummy, I need some other vitamins and minerals!!! I am sure planning on having a full night of sleep tonight and make a decision about my travelling mode tomorrow to reach the south island. I mean, train and ferry or airplane? I am not sure I want to do another 11 hours of motorized transportation... Talk to you later! Had dinner with this French couple that's been on their tandem for the last 7 months, across USA, Thaiti and now NZ, Australia and coming will be South East Asia. How impressive and inspiring!!! They shared their bottle of NZ wine, said that the French wine was better, and I shared my chocolate from France and everybody was happy!
     Getting closer to town I had the surprise of my life, the very Canadian and Quebecois Cirque du Soleil was in town!!! Proud Canadian and Quebec flag were floating on the top of the big tent. Small world even if I am at the other end of the world... Eventually I reached my destination, the America's Cup Village where I stopped to the visitor center and purchased my train ticket to Wellington for tomorrow and the ferry for the next day. I didn't spend much time downtown. Part of me wanted to linger and shop a bit, but in a cycling attired and worrying about my bike was not much fun. I purchased a phone card that I would use as well for the internet and checked out my mail. The way back offered me the opportunity to check out my endurance and power as I had to climb this one challenging hill, where you wished you had a grannier than granny gear but I made it. The Great South Road happened to be a big boulevard, busy and used by lots to exit the city. I had to be on the look out for myself. But I made it and gladly sipped on a Pepsi back at the campsite. I had to return on the bike for groceries after that and purchased an all made up Ceasar salad along with couscous, a favorite of mine at home. Yummy. I didn't have any desire to socialize that night and soon retreated in my tent. This older gent from England made a few attempts at starting a conversation with me but sorry, man, no luck tonight, the shop is closed. Wow! Things are going fast. Not that I am in any rush but I feel like I have to experience in the fast lane to see everything I want to see...  I will probably relax with the days going by and once I am in quieter places. Lots of traffic here. And lots of campers in the campground.  It is 8:30 Pm and I am ready to sleep. Had a long day cycling, chain tatoos behind the leg, sunburn on one ankle where I forgot to spread the suntan lotion. You really gotta be careful with the sun in here. It is strong indeed.
  
   First, the captain announced that there were dolphins playing with the waves. Looking down on the water, you could see dozens of dolphins coming to play, two by two. It was so exciting!!! It was a very good moment.I tried to take a picture of them like many of my fellow tourists but they were quick the little buggers! They made the show for 10 minutes and left. The scenery was quite nice, untouched, and some sailing boats around. Mountains, high ones. What a spectacle!  Arrived in Picton, I lost Ed and that was ok, because even if he was really nice, I wanted some time to think about what I would do. I stopped in a bakery and bought a very yummy chicken sandwich with the freshest grain bread I ever had. Then I started cycling. South. I thought I'd cycle to the first town, Blenheim and decide myself tomorrow. It would give me a short day cycling so I thought I'd tour around the wineries and also check out the quilt store, as I saw it advertised on a flyer at the ferry terminal. Stopped at a juice bar and got myself tempted by a very yummy and thick juice, and bought some fruits. The riding was nice, as I was enjoying a strong tailwind. I checked in a a campsite recommended from the visitor info bureau, and I didn't regret it. Away from all the other campers, I found myself by a quiet river under a large tree (weeping something) in between fields of sheeps. Only it was a little far from the toilets and kitchen but I loved it...    After unloading and pitching my tent, I left for my ride, and soon after stopped in a winery where a wine glass was pushed in my direction for a free tasting... All white wine, and even a dessert wine... That was fun, and after that I decided not to stop in all the wineries because I wouldn't be able to come back to the campsite...    The ride took me farther than I thought and I came back by 6:30pm tired and hungry. Cooked myself some nice pasta with tomato sauce and talked with the other campers before retiring for the night   
   The first climb of this tour took some of my breath away and I was all sweat, but I did it. I had to find some good reasons to stop and taking pictures was a good one... 40 km after leaving I got hit by strong headwind that slowed me down considerably. All of a sudden, I was fighting to go at 10 km/hr. Geez! That was not fun. I was getting frustrated and angry at myself for choosing "clockwise" but carried on. I crossed path with a few cyclists going in the other direction and they seemed to have a jolly time. One stopped and told me to turn around!!! No I said, I'm going this way!!! I carried on for 2 km more that took a long time, and then I said that's it! I can't do it. And I turned around, climbing back what I just descended and all of a sudden my speed was 35-40 km/hr in the flat!!! I stopped in Seddon for tea and cake and met up with the same guy that was cycling with a support van, along with a dozen people. We talked about cycling, New Zealand, Canada, USA, power outages in California, parrots and everything in between. I got coaxed to stop here for the nightwith them and reassess the next day. Which I did. Talked with a lot of nice people, sipped on tea, had a delightful shower, wrote my journal,went for groceries and took it easy. We returned to the tea house after dinner for a drink and retired in our tent when the rain started...
         It was a  long day cycling. I got some headwind but not as much as yesterday. My average speed is the witness: 17-18 km/hr. When I finally made it to Kaikoura, I pitched my tent at the campground and went to town to do internet work. Well the connection was so slow that I got frustrated very fast. It was when I came out of there that I met this couple from Holland, one guy with a bob trailer and his girlfriend, and they have been on their bike for the last 2.5 year!!! They left Holland to Turkey, then travelled east: Iran, middle east, India, Nepal China, and South East Asia. They are now in New Zealand for a few months... That is quite impressive ot me. I felt like having some company tonight and invited them at my campsite but they declined. They travel very cheap, see, they sleep in the bush, filter their water from rivers and live quite cheaply... The motorcamp in Kaikoura is a brand new facility, brand new turf and brand new kitchen for the guests to use. For 9$NZ I thought it was pretty good. I pitched my tent on the outskirt of the campsite so I could have a view on the mountains when I'd get up and hopefully I would get a quiet night.That evening I had a good look at my map and started to do some planning. I have been looking for white gas for my stove for a while now and haven't been able to find any. Mind you there are a lot of services around so far anyways. I want to cross over to the west coast now and hope to get away from the head winds.  Went to bed by 8:30PM and fell asleep quite fast...
   I was really counting on a bottle of Coke at the junction where I would turn towards the West coast, but nothing. Bare. Just a deserted rest area. No picnic table, even. I was disconcerted because I was running out of water too with at least 20 km to go in the heat of noon time. There was a RV at the rest area and I asked them for water, and they gave me some with some reluctance. The man was reluctant. His wife insisted that he put some ice in the water, which I was thankful for. It was sooo hot! And dry. The creeks were all dry, I couldn't even refresh. I would say around 35 degrees. Maybe more. After a snack and some water, I carried on, this time against the wind. Bad news. The cars were very scarce and the views quite nice but I had to focus on the cycling and to remain hydrated.     I inherited  a flat tire on an uphill as a gravel truck was passing me. Great! No shade nearby to protect myself so I did the job and carried on against the wind, always. 9-12 km/hour was my speed, so much for bragging about the speed of 28-30 km I liked to do, loaded or not... It was frustrating but also a bit scary to be so remotely located, on my own and at high risk of dehydration. Heat stroke can hit at any time. I was worried of running out of water but I kept drinking, because I had to. At 80 km on my computer, I was waiting for the town to appear in front of my eyes but it didn't. Just yet another hill to climb that kept me discouraged with the strong wind that was pushing me backwards. The views around were astounding but again I was exhausted and overdosed on sunshine. Soon after there was a fun windy downhill and found myself in town.    The motorcamp is basic but cheap too: 5$ I pitched the tent in the deserted field had a shower to get rid of the grit acquired from changing the flat tire, and went in town to buy some food. Had pizza for dinner, as a treat. Crunchie bar for dessert. And my long time wanted Diet Coke. Yummy. I felt dehydrated, and my urine was dark yellow. I must have drank 5 or 6 big water bottles today. So I keep drinking. Not many people in the campsite, it was a quiet evening and night.
     The last few km were long as I was against the wind, and I was tired from the days before. Maybe still recovering from dehydration.. But I did it, arrived by 11:00, or shortly past. I checked in at the backpaacker hostel because it looked nice and conveniently located in town. The town looks like a  swiss village, and the hostel looked like a chalet. Small yard for camping but I asked if it was quiet around and she said yes. So I rented my tent space and started pitching. There was a  german guy in the garden and a bull dog laying there, sleeping in the heat of the day. Had a hunger attack and made myself a cheese sandwich and heard snoring in the garden. Wow, I thought, this guy is snoring loud!!! Few times I was looking and the guy seemed like doing some reading. After a while he made the remark that it was the dog snoring and not him... Ah ah ah!!!! That was too funny. A snoring dog... I had a shower, and did an hour of web page work, replied to few e-mails, and went in town. The afternoon went slowly, it was way too hot to do anything but hang out in the shade. Had dinner and then watched a movie on the VCR- The Green Mile. That was a very good movie. Everybody else went to the hot springs, and as for me, I couldn't understand that by this heat you would like to soak in hot water. My tent site got invaded by 2 more tents including some people that speak real loud. I wasen't very happy as I wanted to rest and catch up with my sleep. Never again, I promised myself, I would go to a backpacker. Fortunately I had some ear plugs for the night...
   As I headed west I could notice how the mountains gradually becamee greener and forested, and the air was becoming more humid. Funny transition. Eventually I found myself all wet from a  shower. It actually felt good to be rained on. I didn't even bother putting on my rain jacket as I wasen't cold at all, still climbing and working hard. Welcome to the Wet West Coast, I seemed to hear from the sky... Duh!!! I met a lot of cyclists going the opposite direction, most of them were sagged doing the Arthur Pass and the Lewis Pass circuit through Christchurch. That was before the rain. The bugs seemed to find me everytime I stopped today. I was glad I had some repellent (bought yesterday). The wind found me as well today. Head wind of course. The the rain found me... Gradually it started to downpour, especially on the pass, and on the 6 km downhill I had to coveer till my destination, Maruia Springs.I put on my jacket before I got too cold and my shoe covers. The way downhill was nice, I didn't have to pedal and didn't have to drink from my water bottle, as I had all the water I wanted. It was very lush green around, beautiful sceneries but I had to focus on the riding.     Maruia Springs announced itself and I checked in for a tent site. I rushed in the washroom to pour some hot water on my cold hands. Pitching the tent in the rain is not my favorite activity, as as soon as I put the ground sheet down, there was a puddle of water there and then  my tent got all wet and then there was a puddle on the floor. I learned quickly what sandflies were and what they wanted (your skin) as they invited themselves in as soon as I opened the door. I let few swear words out. It was a tough one all together. I rushed in the hot springs for some warming up and to forget it all up for few minutes. Beside the smell and the staining of my silver ring, it was wonderful. I stayed there until my skin looked like a prune, showered and then I had to face again my wet tent and the sandflies. Once settled in my tent, it wasen't that bad... My sleeping bag warmed me up and I dozed for half an hour. When I woke up I made myself some dinner, standing up and fighting with the sandflies that clouded around me. I was the only one there until a couple came in but kept to themselves. Who would like to camp in the rain anyways? The campsites in NZ rarely include picnic tables in their pieces of furniture. It's quite weird. So I had a bla dinner, pasta with a mushroom soup and tuna, atanding up and dancing around to keep the bugs away. The food went in nicely. I needed the energy. After dinner, dishes and brushing my teeth, I felt pretty sedate and found refuge in my sleeping bag, for the night. My legs were sore from all the climbing I did today. Let's hope for a sunny day tomorrow, ok???
  I have long to say about where I slept last night. I slept well after chasing all the sandflies from my tent. In the morning I woke up having to pee and I didn't want to leave the warmth of my sleeping bag as it was quite cool out there. The good news was that it wasen't raining. The bad news was that the sandflies were  waiting for me as I went out and didn't leave me alone until I was on the road. The breakfast at the lodge was 15$ and included all the greasy and low carb stuff. I passed, had a light breakfast of leftovers and decided to have something in the next town. The packing was aweful with having to wring everything and  to pack it up wet.Being on the road again felt comforting to me and it was all downhill, so that was good. It went very fast, and soon enough I was sitting in front of a cup of tea and 2 dry and almost burnt toasts.They offered me some vegemite and sorry you guys, I am Canadian and vegemite tastes like... yeast. I am not putting that on my toasts...  The clouds had gradually lifted and  given place to the sunshine, however it was cool. Ahhhhhh!   Leaving Spring Junction, the road took me uphill for about 8 km, which gave me a little sweat, wearing long sleeves this morning. This shirt was however nice on the downhill afterwards as it was partly shaded.  And it took me to Reefton, where I decided I would carry on all the way to the West Coast to Greymouth, which would give me  140 km for the day. The rationale to that decision was that I was having a good day, I was going downhill all day losing more than 600 m  over 70 km and I could enjoy the servicess that a big town had to offer including drying my clothes and buying some food cheaply, and also do my banking. Well I forgot we were Saturday today, and the bank would be closed to change my traveller's checks tomorrow.  140 km takes a long time to cycle. I will admit to that much. And the services in between the last section were inexistent as all of them beside pubs were closed. I was hoping for a break, a bottle of Coke, and maybe some chocolate. I saved my money (by default) and kept cycling. Gradually the valley I was cycling into enlarged and the forest got farther and farther, Lots of cows and lots of opened fields towards the end. And the wind became stronger, increasingly.  Head wind that is. Ohhhh.... again I made it to Greymouth shortly after 5pm, after having spent 7 hours on the saddle. Looking for places to stay I chose the backpacker hostel called "Global Village". (Believe it or not, I chose a backpacker)  I saw pictures of it at the visitor information and the philosophy of the hostel seemed quite nice. I checked it out and after 140 km, you don't want to fart around for a place to crash, and you are sure not too fussy. I had pizza for dinner tonight as a treat, after putting the tent and gear to dry and taking a shower. That was yummy and very fast to cook. I planned my day off as... a really nice cycling day trip for tomorrow and got to bed early that night.  There were people not far from my tent around a fire that were giggling and chatting, and I was worried they would be roudy but I put on my eaar plugs and settled down nicely.
   So scenic. I got real excited. I truly believed I was in paradise.    Though there was a bit of work involved, I was happy. The flowers, the mountains, the ocean, everything was just perfect! The ups and downs, the cliffs, the ocean views, all that lasted for 14 km. I stopped many times to take pictures, just because I felt inspired. Then the road took me inland again with some rolling hills and I faced a bit of a headwind. It also got a bit cooler as the clouds had rolled in. Arriving into the final destination, Punakaki, I went directly for the vistas where I took some pictures and ate my yummy Crunchie bar. The views were nice but not too surprising to me as I already saw it in picture so I didn't lingeer there too much. It was infested with tourists also which took away some of the experience.      The visitor center featured some cave interpretation and had as well some track information. (hiking trails). I reflected about what I was missing out by sitting on my bike, as I didn't have hiking gear. I was wondering whether it was possiible to incorporate those activities or maybe it was just better to come back on another trip and explore in a different way. The way back home, using the same route, was different to my eyes. First I noticed that I had a tail wind. YESSSSSSS!!!!! Tail wind! Finally! Thank you thank you!!!!     I met a few cyclo-tourists going the other direction of course, and we just waved hi and goodbye. Again this was a lonesome ride, not too many people to talk to and to share with. I resigned to think that it may be like that for the rest of my trip as everybody have a destination in mind and have their own pace. It is difficult to match that. If ever it happens that I can match that with someooone else, fine. But I am all right on my own. Not sad about it, I hope this is not the message I convey. Not even disappointed.  The tail wind made me happy and made me pedal harder on the uphills so I don't lose my speed. I kept looking at the lush green mountains and thinking that the monkeys would be real happy here. The only reason why there is no monkey here is that they haven't been swiming from Indonesia as of yet. They don't know what they are missing. The evening has been leisurly, after a nice salad and couscous dinner. Decided to cycle some more in the evening to catch a glimpse of the sunset over the Tasman sea...     
   The second part was much more scenic as I could see the mountains with some snow on its peaks, and I weaved through national parks, protected lands, up some hills and down crossing rivers, crossing twice on a shared car-train, one way narrow bridge.That was cool and the cars patiently waited that I am through before passing me.    The "highway" was pretty quiet, some of the time I didn't see any car for 5 minutes. I have heard some birds songs that were quite pretty. I wonder what those birds look like... I made it to my campsite by 4:00 PM. It was a relief, as the end was getting quite hilly and I was geting tired. There is a tavern on one side, where I paid for my campsite and there is a teahouse/museum/small farm/whatever across the street, where I purchased some pepsi.    This guy is quite un-ordinary, he has a giant sandfly hidden in the roof of his building. Every morning he gets the giant sandfly out for the tourists to see from the road and every night he gets her in to make sure she won't get cold... The inside of the museum is full of little saying to its wall. I retained one in my journal: "Save the forest, eat possums".For those of you that need explanations, possums are the racoons of Down Under. They don't feast off camper's leftovers but on tree bark. They are nocturnal animal so you never see them unless the are road kill. They were introduced to New Zealand from Australia which was apparently a very bad move, so I have been told... Ahhhh! Pepsi! I am on my own here camping and 2 couples at the hostel beside where I go to the washroom and use the kitchen facilities. It would be nice to see some cyclists sometimes, and even share the campsite! I saw 5 or 6 again today, but all of them going in the opposite direction. The nerve... That is it for the day, had a nice pasta dinner and had some cookies for dessert and I couldn't stop eating them and I ate it all... The stars appeared one by one tonight in the sky, it was quite the show, and as I fell asleep listening to 2 owls calling each other...
   When I went to the visitor center in search for info and for accomodation, they told me that the town was filling up quite fast and to hurry up to get a spot, even for camping. So the first backpacker I found there was a camp spot available and I took it. It's cramped, it's busy and my tent spot is on a piece of lawn as big as... well a sheep would finish it in 1 hour! Not much ambiance at the hostel I think. Nobody talking to anybody. I eventually went to town, bought some food, made dinner and ate reading my guide book. The first thing you notice of Franz Josef is the constant helicopter landing and taking off for the tourists in it to enjoy. It is quite irritating and one wished they could stop sometimes... After dinner I went back to town for an internet session and went for a walk to watch the sunset which was terrific tonight. Lots of pink hues in the sky, that was awesome. I got terribly bitten by the sandflies and it was getting cold, so I missed the grand finale, but oh well.    I am exhausted tonight and I can't make a decision about what I will do tomorrow. Will sleep first. OK. Bye.
   Met up with some tandem riders from Kansas city and we talked about cycling and other things for a while. Spent the evening watching tv after eating yucky pizza, and talking with the others in the tv room. A lot of people think I am quite brave to cycle all those hills in NZ. Those are the people that go sky diving, bungee jumping and what else...I am trying also to figure out what I will do in the next few days. Duh. Cycling. But I have only 70$ cash left in NZ currency and no bank for 4 days. So I am examining the options...
  
   Got myself organized at the campsite and 2 german guys came in and set up close to me. Cyclists!!! Finally! The grocery store was very expensive and restricted in fruits and veggies and I did my best to buy stuff I could use. I had less and less money and had to be careeful. The little shop didn't take credit card. I also met at the campsite one of those cyclists that want to check out whether the earth is round. This one is from Switzerland, and has cycled from home, through the middle east, then India, Pakistan, Nepal and Tibet, and he said he ate Ramen Noodles for 3 months in Tibet because there is no food there.2.5 years later he is in NZ. Very impressive. Along with a couple from England, our little group had dinner together and we inherited of the leftover turkey of a senior group that were at the motorcamp. We also had some leftover cake that was quite yummy.I got so stuffed because I made myself a big dish of pasta. There is a bit of guilt involved here but I thought it would be ok because I would have a big day tomorrow. 80 km of nice views and 14 km of hell... So, I am clean, I am fed, nails cut, laundry done, rested, all that's left is to climb that hill. And live to tell about it... Good night!!!
   After the bridge there must have been a 12 or 13% gradee for 1.5 to 2 km; it was really tough and my knees could feel the load I was carrying, as well as my lower back. I was sweating. You should have seen the eyes of the tourists on the tour bus that was going the opposite direction. All the chins were down on their laps. Haast Pass is only 591 m high, the lowest of the passes on the South Island. The grade was bad but got better and I found myself enjoying the views and gradually it stopped raining.The yellow wildflowers got quite stunning and the creek water was turquoise. Then all of a sudden, it was it! Haast Pass, the top and it wasen't going any higher. Geez, that's it? Just when I was starting to have fun? I met a couple of Dutch cyclist on recumbents and going South too. I was glad to see them, I wanted to talk to them a bit but I think that I intruded on their privacy. So I carried on.    The downhill was not too long as I was going to 300 m not to sea level and found myself gradually emerging of the clouds and the low pressure system and as I was exiting Mount Aspiring National Park, the sun came out! There was now a healthy tail wind and my bike computer started to work again. It doesn't like the rain I guess.    The riding was really nice, the geography was changing gradually leaving the rainforests behind for something drier. Mountains, still, high ones, but without the forests. Arriving to Makarura, I was disappointed to still find very little services. Just teahouse, and a very small store some internet access, and camping and cabins. There was barely a banana in the store. I didn't want to stop here, I still had energy to carry on and I wanted to enjoy the nice tail wind I had.I talked to few people in the teahouse's parking lot as some cyclists heading North were thinking about what to do seeing the rain falling on Haast.They were also facing the wind which made the riding difficult. I was sure glad to head South with that screaming tailwind. It was giving me a firm push up the hills, and no efforts on the downhill.I was singing out loud and calling the sheeps around. BEEEEEEE I found the DOC campsite on the edge of Lake Wanaka and it was very windy. It dried my stuff in no time. It is rather cold though. But very little sandflies. My poor feet were like prune when I freed them of the soggy cycling shoes. Found my watch unpacking tonight, it was in my sleeping bag. Had dinner of Ramen noodles, a Crunchie Bar for dessert and an orange and cookies for 2nd and 3rd dessert. Ahhhh! The great outdoors... Makes you hungry. So enough for tonight. As I write this last entry in my journal I am itching everywhere from all the sandflies bites. Not pleasant at all. And still finding some live ones in my tent... Grrrrrrr! Should start an import-export business.
   It passes at 405 m at its highest then descends to Lake Hawea on a windy scenic road to the lake. Funny thing is as much as I had a tail wind few kms behind, I started on a light headwind at first that increased as the lake uncovered. Weird, uh?      From the neck to the city of Lake Hawea it was much hillier, and some of the hills were quite steep! I met up with other cyclists heading North wishing them luck by psychic power as I knew they'd get rain, and stopped in the little town for sport drink. The way to Wannaka was up and down, lots of it and same story, some of them steeper than other. My front speed shifter is acting out and when I want to shift to the smaller ring sometimes, it won't happen. So I just have to take off my show from the cleat and kick it a bit and it will change. But it is not always practical as sometimes I need a lower gear and I need it now...as I lose mementum quickly. The other problem on my bike is my left handle bar shifter grip that is ripping off. It has now become an antique part and I couldn't find it in the US and I am now expecting to have the same problem here. But hopefully in Queenstown... The first thing I did when I made it to Wanaka was to stop at the visitor center, where people book huts for tramping (hiking) and get info about the different hikes around. Well I wanted to know where the internet stations were in town and they looked at me weird... Well, I know it sounded a bit odd hence I am surrounded by beauty and in a district of conservation office. But the girl has to do it, so... And then I asked about keas, the mountain parrots to see if I had a chance to see them around here. Well, I would have to meet them in their habitat on the glacier around Mount Aspiriing. It would be a full day trip with the bus. Too bad. Can't do it. Next time. Then I checked in at the campsite which has a hiker-biker section and met up with 2 other cyclists coming from Invercargill by bus today. They were very friendly. Morris is coming from Auckland (a local) and Cindy is from Boston. We had a brief chat and they were off to town, so I pitched my tent and left for some more cycling as I only did 54 km today and wanting more. By that point it was very sunny and hot and the views around this part of Lake Wanaka were astounding. It is very dry here. I headed on the west side of the lake and followed the road leading to Mount Aspiring for 12 km, to Glendhu Bay.    I had fa-bu-lous views all the time, passing a hiking trail, a few farms, a couple of donkeys, sheeps, a winery (looked the other way) and the views of the lake were forcing me to stop often and take pictures. It was hilly and the wind pushed me all the way there, I had a blast. The way back was head wind but I managed ok without the weight of my packs. Then I headed in town and found the internet place. 2 hours on the computer, in the shade until I had a hunger attack so I had to go. Then I hit the groceery store. My god! First real grocery store in 7 days. It was food paradise. Great fruits and veggies section. For once. The bulk section was great too. I found everything I wanted at a great price and came back to town with a full pack inclluding Pepsi and chips. The shower felt great and I had dinner with Morris and Cindy joined in later. I am so thrilled by this day.   
   South of that lake was Cromwell, my halfway point, and the fruit orchards. Peaches, apricots, apples, pears. Veggies too.I stopped in one of those fruit stands and bought 2 plump peaches and some prunes. Yummy. In Cromwell, I stopped for a break and found a bakery. Bought some Coke and a muffin and sat with this biker- motorcyclist that is; he is a Kiwi from Wellington. Looks like Kevin Costner :-)  We talked for quite a while, sharing stories of the road and he showed me his pictures of a bungee jump he did in Queenstown. That looked impressive. I enjoyed his company but after a while it was time to say goodbye, and head West towards Queenstown and him East toward Christchurch. Awwwwww, bye, Kevin Costner! From Cromwell it got better and better. I started getting side wind and then tail wind and entered Kawarau Gorge.    Dried mountains, semi desertic, rocky. The road. And on the left side, in the bottom, this sometimes wild sometimes quiet turquoise creek that would twist and turn. That ws great!!! Apparently Cindy and Morris have been discouraged to ride this section, but to me it was just a hint that it would be interesting... In fact, it was spectacular!!! Lots of roadkills though, and sometimes I had to wind my way around them: rabbits and hedgehogs especially. As I climbed and got on a higher plateau, wineries and vineyards got more and more frequent and were adding more beauty to the panorama. Then came the bungee zone. A bridge over the creek. And lots of people paying to jump off the bridge... I watched some people jump and got all carried on by the adrenaline rush, just for watching...    And I continued my journey. The 80 km mark... then 90...I was running out of steam with the afternoon heat. The 100 km was worse. And my bike was playing games with me, moody with the gear changing especially on the harder hills. So I had to grind on a higher speed than I wanted to bargain. The kick to the thing trick was not always possible... Then the traffic got heavier and the mountains more spectacular. Here I was in Queenstown!!! Wow! The Whistler of NZ! I've been coming from far and here I was!!! I was tired and headed to the visitor center for info about motorcamps. Another hill later, I pitched the tent on a potentially noisy campsite. It was 5:00 PM. And all I wanted to do was to go around and have a look even though I was very tired. There were paragliders doing circle in the sky nearby and the gondola taking people to the sky for a nice view. For tonight I chose a visit to the Kiwi and birdlife Park for a view of the infamous keas I wanted to see and the kiwis as well. As I entered to the gift shop to pay the netrance fee, I had left the door opened and a duck came right behind me and entered like he was living here! The ranger escorted him out, before he gets into messy trouble.    So I saw the keas. Bigger birds than I imagined. Green and the inside of their wings are orange. Those one were born in captivity and are in a tastful aviary outside. Very nice. And about the kiwis... We had to enter a dark room to view them as those guys are nocturnal animals. No wings. Long, very fine beak that sure could help me with those tent pegs!!! And a round body a bit smaller than a basketball. They are funny! It took the help of the ranger to show me where they were on the display. That was soo cool!!!! Then I headed into town, did some internet work, bought dinner and came back home. Will call it a day real soon after dinner. Am skipping the shower as I am too tired even though I am quite dirty. I don't care. Looked at my plans for tomorrow, at maps, and there I was... la la land...
    

   Then we took the tunnel down towards the Sound, 1.2 km long, in the dark, 10% grade.It is also unlit as there is no power coming up this way. That tunnel took 20 years to dig, through the mountain's massive rock. On the other side we had to weave our way through a serie of switchback in 20 km, steeply down the hill. We met 2 cyclists that were coming up the hill under a heavy rain. I sure didn't envy them, but in the same time I was wondering whether I made the right decision not to cycle through this section.It was so pretty, and I would have liked to spend more time with the keas. In counterparts, Te-Anau gets 44 inches of rain every year and Milford gets an astounding 300, being 120 km away from one another! So down the hill we go and without warning, and without ceremony, there it was, Milford Sound and its famous Mitre Peak, the one we see on all the post cards and lots of posters of New Zealand. Unfortunately we didn't stop for pictures and headed right into the terminal where we would board the ship.    On the ship, still raining pretty hard, I wanted to stay outside and savour the moment, look at the Sound and take pictures. Well, there was no point to get wet before we even started, really, so after a while I gave in and served myself some hot tea. I was the only one travelling by myself and the average of the crowd was well over 40, but everybody was really nice. Had nice conversations with a couple from South Africa and England. The South Africans found the exchange rate very bad and were finding everything very expensive. It made me thing about how lucky I was to be in Canada. I also found out they are owned by a parrot too...      As we left the port we saw few groups of sea kayakers exploring the coast and its waterfalls that were quite loaded with water. The first ones you saw were quite impressive. As we went towards the Tasman sea, there were hundreds of them. It was because it was raining hard and the water had to go somewhere. The waterfalls would all stop falling 20-30 minutes after it stops raining. So you pick: a sunny day, great views,no waterfalls or a rainy day, big and lots of waterfalls...      As for wildlife, we saw seals. But seals are boring. Lots of seals in BC. The sea got quite agitated towards the end of the sound and my stomach got quite queasy. The visibility got close to nothing so we headed back. When the boat got more stable, I ate my lunch, drank my Diet Coke and ate the yummiest cookies for dessert, the kind that don't exist if I don't bike. I was glat to return onto firm ground, and sit in the van. However the way back, beside being rainy was quite windy and I got motion sickness again. The rain carried on and instead of stopping in all those nice places for short walks, we just headed back. Group decision. The keas don't like the rain either and so they were nowhere to be found. The waterfalls close to the tunnel were more numerous than in the morning and the water would rush down furiously. It was surreal. We were dropped off in our respective motel/motorcamp under a clearing sky in Te-Anau. I was glad to get off the van and thought "never again". The motion sickness would stay woth me the whole evening. No more car trip for me. I will ride my bike thank you! I spent a quiet evening at camp, updating my web-site, icing my knee and having a nice dinner: macaroni with tomato and veggies sauce. Yummy.  I am heading South as planned tomorrow, towards Invercargill and will see how far I will go. Riverton is said to be pretty but it's 148 km away from here! I'll see how it goes.And depends in the winds too. I hope to sleep well tonight as last night my neighbor was snoring quite loudly. I could do with a good night of sleep. Kia Ora

   Then I reached the coast. Wow! Blue water, nice sandy beach and the sound of the waves crashing on the beach. The time for a picture and off I was again, climbing and going down hills. I saw a couple of wooly escappees wandering the Southern Scenic Road and as a car or a woman on a bike would come close, they would attempt to join back their friends only to crash on the wired fence. I felt for those guys because they looked so scared! And I wouldn't improvise a rescue as I just didn't know where to lead them. Passing Riverton there was an "Estuary Fair" going on and I stopped at the teahouse for hot chips and a sandwich, oh, and Diet Coke. I sat outside to watch what was going on and I was greeted by:" Hi, do you recognize me? I met you in Kaikoura!" Good memory, that girl! It was the girlfriend of the guy I spoke to that was travelling around the world for the last 2 and a half years. They now had some family visitting and had been renting a car with them for the last 3 weeks. It was nice talking with her again and share experience. As I left there was a parade in preparing but I didn't want to stay any longer.  The second part to Invercargill was rather plain as I was going through... plains and the traffic got heavier. I had a light headwind and was trying to stay over 20km/hour. Arriving to Invercargill, the South of the South, I was greeted by my first traffic light of the South Island, a Mc Donald, burger King and a Pizza Hut. Wow, welcome back into civilization! I found the visitor center downtown and chose a campsite nearby, right behind a prison! It is the closest to downtown and as I have a long day tomorrow I don't want to ride extra kms just to leave town. 7.50$ was pretty decent and I aslo purchased token and soap for laundry. I wasen't really due but I thought it wouldn't hurt. See, it is part of my need for comfort. Tent pitched, I had a lovely shower and headed for groceries. The full alley of fruits and veggies amazed me and again I felt like being in food wonderland!!! After that I hunted for an internet place which lead me right back to the visitor center, and as it was pricey and coin operated, didn't manage to do much more than answer e-mails, and I am now 3 days late to my trip report! It won't get any better as I don't expect any computer access in the next 3 days. I headed next door to Queens park and visited an aviary with keas and other large parrots and some smaller and more colorful parakeets. Had dinner with ceasar salad and couscous, and yogourt for dessert. I have been eating rather junk food lately and was sure glad to see greens on my plate. Have been talking with this german guy that has just finished law school and is travelling now trying to decide what he will do with the rest of his life. He is travelling by bike and also does some hiking and has left his bike behind to do some hiking on Stewart Island. When I came out of the kitchen that night, the East was pitch black, the top of the sky was royal blue and the Western horizon was orange. And when I came out of the washrooms, few stars had popped in and a half moon was shining. Kia Ora! See ya!  A few words about how my trip is going. There are now 17 days left to it and I feel rushed!!! I feel there is not enough time! I would need 3 months, maybe more. For the South Island, that is. Well, I will make the most of it. I will come back, and that is a promise!
   The sunshine. And the ocean. I didn't ride by the ocean at all but if I was high enough on a hill, I could see it. I stopped for a long break 12 km farther at Tokanui for Diet Coke and chips and got some info about Curio Bay, the side trip I decided to make. Curio Bay is known for the Hector dolphins that come quite close to the shore. So I took a different road from Tokanui, involving some gravel unfortunately. And it climbed, climbed and climbed.... Again the panoramas were really fabulous. And so was the downhill after the climb.. I was being real careful not to fall, remembering my falls from few days ago. I needed to keep both hands on te handle bar and look out for oncoming traffic. I hated to cross cars because it meant that I would get covered with a film of dust and I would have it everywhere... Including my eyes and my mouth. Eat dust... Eventually I made it to Curio Bay and Porpoise Bay. I headed first to Curio Bay where there is a "petrified forest" by the ocean that is 180 millions years old. The fossils are visible from the cliffs and you can even go and walk on it and see from up close. That was neat.      There was also an unofficial view point where I saw people watching a scene and as I am curious I went by... It's a penguin! Standing there alone on a beach in a small cove. Wow! That was impressive. He was far away, at least 300 feet away but I was lent some binoculars and I could see him from much closer. That was exciting to see a penguin in the wild. Then I headed for Porpoise Bay where there is a campsite, a nice viewpoint on top of a hill and a huge bay sandy beach, with turquoise water.     The Hector dolphins are known to hang out here but considering the white caps on the water, I didn't bother checking if they were around. I also had quite a bit of distance to cover before I reach my chosen motorcamp so I was better get going. The next 20 km were very scenic and hilly and it felt like Christmas when I reached the sealed road... That was at the 100 km point that I started to climb again seriously and shortly after that the gravel road started again. Hills and gravel road together are not much fun. Especially when the gravel is unstable and at times there weren't any track and my bike was treatening to fall. In the same time I was getting more tired  and the wind was still bothering me.What a day! It  was past 6 PM and hungry and not near my campsite yet...    I made it to Papatowai by 19:20 tired, cold, hungry and a bit irritable.(Low blood sugar?) The corner store was closed and there was nobody to greet me to recieve my money so I had to self register. I pitched my tent quickly, completely aware of the noisy neighbors and jumped in the shower. I had to warm-up, and quick! Then, as quickly I started to make dinner, sipping a cup of soup in the meantime. I served myself a generous and yummy serving of macaroni with veggies, tomato sauce and cheese and a Crunchie Bar and an apple for dessert. After that, well, I called it a day. I sure hate those rushed evenings when I come late and hurry for everything before dark and don't have time to watch the sunset. Tomorrow will sure be better as it will be a much shorter day. And tomorrow is my birthday!!!
   After about 30 km I made it to the city of Okawa, which to my surprise has good services, and even a quilting store where I gladly stopped and visitted. The owner is addicted to quilting and showed me her work. Then the next stop was the internet cafe where I spent an hour updating my web site. A good rest for my legs. After that, reluctantly somewhat, I was on my way again. There was another hill that I knew about and though it wasen't that bad I sure was afraid of it and apprehended the grind. I got the wind either behind me or on the side and with all the cookies I had, the energy was coming back... And I knew the end was coming. I guess it helps. The outskirts of Balclutha were not so nice with the very first industries I encountered on the South Island and also a very smelly landfill. I was glad I had a short day. Camp was set up in a smallish camp and I headed for the internet where I updated for an hour worth but lost the whole work into cyberspace because the stupid computer wouldn't save it. That was very frustrating. Fortunately the girl didn't make me pay, but still... All this effort for nothing. I hit a large grocery store and stocked up like if I wouldn't see another store for 2000 more years. I wanted to cook some rice and go to a takeway and pick up some fish (in batter) but it wasen't practical as my rice wouldn't be ready for at least 20 minutes. So I gave up the idea and bought instead some really nice dessert, a strawberry cheesecake.There was a lot of it and I ate it all and now I have a sugar overload.... That was a big meal really.... So this was my birthday ride. I would have liked it to be memorable and exciting but well, it was just another day into my trip. That's fine. No big deal. I am glad to be here and this is special enough...
   Well, what can I say, the sheps need an ocean view to thrive! I kept looking for penguins and no, I didn't see any. The penguins usually go out to sea for the day to feed  and can be seen in the morning and evening. Oh well, it will be for another time... I took a little break in Brighton, little town that I found quite pretty and simple. The houses were not wealthy but the owner were quite proud of them and maintained them well as well as their gardens. Past Brighton, it started to climb again, just a bit at first but my @#$@%$ bike wouldn't change the speeds for me so it was tougher than it should have been (Where is that whip?) But the worse of the climb still had to come, a hill in the suburbs of Dunedin called Costorphine. Oh my god. It was steep, long but paved and at the end of the day, it was a real tough one. I started to count my pedal strokes mentally to 20, over and over again. And it hellped, I did it. It went down right after that to cool me down. Now, Dunedin is not very nice for its cyclists to the fact that they don't sign where the bikes CAN go but they sure sign where the bikes aren't allowed to go. I found myself in the motorway where the bikes are forbidden, and as tired as I was I just couldn't care less. It was all downhill, and flat after that. Lots of shoulder. Totally safe. And so I was in Dunedin. What a relief... The motorcamp was infested with school kids on a few days trip and I had to find a good camping spot to shelter myself from the noise. There were lots of tents around and it was hard to predict which ones would be the noisy ones... Had a shower and felt like getting out of the routine I had set up for myself day after day after day. So I took my bike for a little ride following the "no sweat" rule. The path took me by the beach for a view point and then on the takeways row, for fast food New Zealand way. Nothing sounded appealing as I smeeled the grease from the street so I ended up at the grocery store and bought myslef a chicken pie, and boiled veggies that would make my dinner. Lots of ketchup on top of everything. That was yummy and a good change.  Tomorrow I will visit Dunedin for half of the day and then take the train to Timaru, the begining of a ride towards Lake Tekapo and Pukaki. Should be interesting. Kia Ora from Dunedin...
   On the train I could see that north of Dunedin is very scenic and I wasn't sure I would have seen this from my bike, but who knows? I was glad that I wasn't riding today as I was tired. However I will ride to Pleasant Point which is a short ride from Timaru. It feels like my days have been adding up and have been pretty routine like, a little too much to my liking. Pitching the tent, shower, eat sleep, lift camp, eat, cycle, cycle, cycle. Find food, find a keyboard. I wonder what I can do to make my travelling more interesting and diversified. Does it mean I am bored? Feling too rushed? Tired physically? Mentally? I sure haven't had a full night of sleep lately and have been pushing my body quite a bit through the hills, the gravel and the country. 9PM... I think I am a bit homesick today. On the train I had been seated facing the back of the train and I've been experiencing motion sickness again. I will need to do something about that before I take the train again. The train ride had been 3 h and 30 minutes with the delays and parts of it had been very scenic with the turquoise water of the ocean. Arriving to Timaru, I took advantage of the quiet booking office and reserved a seat on all my onward trains and ferries to Tongariro National Park which is in the middle of the North Island. That means I have to stick to the schedule I made for myself and that means going the distance everyday. Then I clipped on the pedals and headed towards Pleasant Point, a little town on my way to Lake Tekapo. The highway was busy and it was warm, not so enjoyable ride. I ended up in a small suburb town with an empty campsite.I am the only camper tonight beside the caretakers. I set up camp and cycled into town for groceries. Spent my evening watching tv and looking at my map, and by 8:30 prepared myself to go to bed hoping for a restful night.       The birds are sure present around the park and a white cat greeted me out of the washroom and sneaked behind me towards my tent like if I was a bird, trying to hide behind... That was funny.  The moon is getting fuller now and the weather forcast is very good. I need a good day tomorrow and hope for ompany in the evening.
     I found Peddlers Paradise, the cyclists hostel easily. Led by the author of the guide book I am refering to all the time, Nigel greeted me and showed me around. Located in the back of his house, the kitchen has a view of the lake. I had a lovely shower and headed into town. As I set up camp another cyclist dropped in but I haven't seen so much of him. Quiet type I guess? Had another dinner with boiled veggies and meat pie and lots of ketchup, and had a few desserts... Crunchie bar,an orange, and some cookies that are caramel filled and chocolate coated. They are devilish and it's hard to stop eating them, even if I hide them... Then after dinner, Nigel, Chris and I sat at the table with the NZ map and we discussed routes, headwind, hills and points of interest. Of course he told me that my route was all upside down and that if I had carried on clockwise I would have had more tail winds. Ha! Nigel also talked to lenghts about the Lonely Planet guide to cycling in NZ which just came out in the book stores a few months ago and which is now in direct competition with his book and he knows he can't win. His problems rise around distribution of his book as he doesn't have a distributor at all, even in NZ.Well, let's say that I've learned about the difficulties of having your book sold and even accepted in NZ bookstores. The thing is that unfortunately, the Lonely Planet cycling guide is not a great guide, not complete and not showing the real nice parts of NZ and the alternatives. But because it is called Lonely Planet, they get the publicity and distribution all over in the world. If you ever go cycling to New Zealand, try to find the Peddlers Paradise at home or wait to be in New Zealand to purchase it. It is cheaper, encourage a local and you can even have your copy autographed by Nigel!!!
     We made it to Omarama by 16:45 and the English guy waved us goodbye wanting to cover more distance today. Fine. Not me. I was very glad to set up camp in a most civilized campsite get my shower and have my laundry done. Had dinner with Carine and as we talked I poured the dish soap in my dished including my cup as I had a bit of wine. Then we talked some more and Carine decided to have some hot chocolate and I wanted some too. As I didn't rince my cup wad was busy talking, my hot chocolate had a dish soap taste!!!(Kids don't try this at home) Carine and I had a good laugh about it... Nice to have some good company.
   There were sheeps grazing nearby, some dogs tied up to their dog houses, a few kitties running scared at each move I was doing, and a few massive bulls resting.        The surrounding mountains were beautiful, bare as the clouds had now lifted. As we laid there on the grass the sheeps got curious after their initial scare, and came near enough to be petted and to accept some grass from our hand. That was a real change of behavior!!! Later, I would serve myself with some cookies and each time they would hear the paper noise, they would come running!!! Leisurly evening tonight after a yummy dinner shared with Carine. Life is good.
   Had a great day today. Slept well- but the usual getting up in the middle of the night thing. The moon rise over the mountains was beautiful as it is getting fuller and fuller.      This morning, Carine and I left early as we wanted an early arrival to Oamaru, so we could view the penguins as they come before sunset. We retraced our steps from last afternoon riding 4 km in the gravel and downhill back to the highway. The air was quite crisp and even though I had my leggings, 2 pairs of socks, long sleeve thermo-shirt and a wind breaker, I had chills and my fingers were like popsicles. Oh well. With the blue sky and the bright sunshine I would eventually warm up. The way to Kurow, about 20 km was up and down. nothing too difficult really. Maybe one longer hill made me sweat some but  nothing to be scared of. We stopped in Kurow for tea with a quarter of a cup of sugar in it for me ( had to ask for more sugar in the pot) and I also had some yummy chocolate fudge. I stocked up with a muffin ,juice and a Crunchie bar for the road as this morning, I litterally ran out of food. There was just an apple and peanut butter in my bags, and really not much services but that tea house till Oamaru.      We opted for the scenic route to Oamaru passing through small villages and through lots of farms. There was also the very interresting "elephant rocks" a weird rock formation in the form of large boulders in a field, very popular to the local rock climbers.    We stopped and took some pictures and after that we climbed and climbed as the road meandered and then were allowed to go down, and that was a real nice long descent into the bottom of a canyon. Quite scenic. Carine and I ended up in Weston after passing a few sunflower fields and we bought some well deserved bubbly refreshment (Coke) and had a snack(chocolate). In fact we were just a few km away from our destination but I was glad to get the break. In town, after finding the only motorcamp, we set up and  headed in search of an internet cafe as it's been a few days already. We didn't find anything open so we went to the grocery store. I was becoming increasingly irritable and the noise of the  street, the kids jumping with their skateboards, their music, everything was unbearable.  I got a dizzy spell down the alleys at the grocery. And I really knew then that I needed to get some food in and fast... I was low in blood sugar... I sat down right into the store and ate before I pass out and then Carine and I headed to the motorcamp for an early dinner, boiled veggies and meat pies. Lots of ketchup. The way to the yellow-eyes penguin colony is not flat (hihi) There is a big hill to climb up and then down the other way almost to sea level, including a part in lose gravel. There must be 40-50 people around here. On the hide, it is written to come in, to be quiet and wait for them to come ashore. If we see them coming, not to move, and hide so they don't see us. If the penguins see people on the beach or anywhere they won't come  and feed the juveniles waiting at the nest. Well, as I am writing this there are people sitting on the fence right above the cliffs, well in view, overlooking the beach.  We have been waiting well over an hour and still no penguin... 21:45 Back from the penguin viewing... We saw 3 or 4 yellow-eyed penguins from so far they wouldn't make a dot on a picture. But it made a nice meditation on how fragile this specie is and how important it is to respect mother nature. I must say that our patience have been tested as you will wait more than you will see. I observed that there are some people that just can't sit there and say nothing. They have to talk, they have to laugh, they also have to say very stupid stuff... To me, this was the time to be quiet and respect the penguins in their environment. We are the visitors, they are home. OK. Enough said about that. By 8PM, Carine and I were happy to move on to the next "viewing" area, the blue penguins. Well, to see them you must pay 8$, however the profits made goes into penguin conservation, research and education. They are much smaller, about 25 cm or 10 uinches tall and weigh about 1 kg. They're not as shy and sensitive as the other kind of penguins    and  they would come as close as 4 feet of people.    They come off to shore for the night and return to sea with the descending tide to feed again. The molting ones would not be waterproof and would stay ashore, not eating for 15-17 days. The one molting we saw was quite in a foul mood and was hissing on the other penguins nearby. See what the lack of food do to you??? We also saw the full moon rising from the ocean, which made the whole experience quite magical. Then by 21:15, Carine  and I were yawning and it was time  to return to camp... So after putting the lights up on the bikes, we left the harbor and had the surprise of our life when, 100 m later we almost ran over a crossing penguin that was heading for his nest... He passed right in front of our wheels...     

   Gradual, meandering climb of 5.5 km I cycled past the beautiful homes and gardens perched on the hills , all of them having a view on the oceean and the estuary.     I had a work out out of the climb but my legs were used to it by now and I didn't carry the weight of my packs. On top of that hill (350m of it) past the houses, there was some spectacular views around each turn I was taking. First the estuary and the beach, then, East and South I found myself on the edge of a crater and looking at some old volcanic land.        This was fabulous. I had to stop often to click the camera and admire the panorama. The way down too was wonderful passing the gondola (what's the point of paying 15$ for the gondola when you can cycle all the way up there yourself???) and a famous restaurant, the Sign of the Kiwi. I really enjoyed myself downhill, still meandering and passing lots of cyclist on their uphill work out.       Oh yeah, I almost forgot mentioning about my bike computer. Kaput! Gone! Finished! Finito. After the wiring being a problem, I  found that the taping along the frame got unglued and the wire was dangling freely. I didn't make a big deal out of it as I was busy admiring the panoramas and at some point, I didn't even notice, the wire got caught on one of my pedal and the latter got a big bite out of it, like a shark. Gone. No more. I realised quickly I lost one of my bearings... Will hang tight to my watch.... may be useful in the future to know the time. Heading back in town I stopped for errands and headed back "home" for a delightful shower. After dinner, wanting to avoid staying longer than wanted at the motorcamp I took a ride downtown to places I haven't been like the Art Gallery building and the outskirts of the botanical gardens. The usual internet work got into my schedule and I came back home to an astounding sunset as the rain that was supposed to come didn't and left behind some clouds that got lightened by a descending sun. I called it a day early as I was rather tired.
       Close to Picton we watched the efforts of helicopters with barils of water trying to put out a forest fire before it made too much damage. It would be critical they hurried because of the dryness of the area and the wind that is always strong.      As we made it into Picton I didn't have much time to hang out, I had to get my boarding pass for the Interislander and head to the quay so I could get in the boat. There were many cyclists like me waiting to get the signal to board- (Well, where were they anyways? Didn't see them cycling)  I started chatting with an Irish girl travelling and working in NZ for 9 months before returning to school and we hung out together for the duration of the sailing. We saw briefly a small pod of dolphins once and we then headed inside as it started to spit rain. Finding my way through Wellington was almost as easy as weaving my way in Vancouver; I found a bike path over an overbridge and headed South in a rush hour Wellington. I was disappointed that the hostel wasen't farther as I needed the workout, but no. Nicely located, there is a grocery store right in front of the YHA  (Youth Hostel Association) and we are very close to the downtown area, if not in it. I found myself in a 4 beds dorm and realized that it was the first time in 5 weeks I would be sleeping in a real bed. Impressive, uh? There were 2 old ladies that would be my roommates for the night and I was glad as I thought I'd have a good night with them. I quickly changed in shorts and cycling attire and headed out the door for a much needed spin. I have been recommended to head to the cable car and take it up for 1.50$ and to go down through the botanical garden. Well, duh! I wanted a real work out! So I climbed to the cable car by bike which was really a piece of cake, not even 100 m and came down the same way.     I almost passed in front of the most beautiful quilt store of NZ so far but unfortunately (and fortunately for my wallet) it was closed. All I could do was admire this large queen-size Baltimore appliques quilt. The ride didn't take the edge off- I probably would have needed at least 50 km of riding but it didn't happen as it was getting dark. After showering I crossed to the grocery store and it had to be the best stocked store I ever encountered in NZ wit ha lot of choices at the deli counter and the bakery and I stopped my choice on a gourmet chicken and vegetable pie and a garden salad bowl that included the dressing. Yum!         The evening was spent walking downtown in search of a computer place to catch up with my work but they were all closed. However I enjoyed watching people dining in the restaurants and groups of people having a drink at the pub, and looking at what people were up to in Wellington. Saw a casino but resisted to get in. Wanted to keep my money for myself thank you! Went to bed quite early, shortly after 9 and the lights were already out in my dorm which I considered a good sign...
     All three are in Tongariro National Park, a must see if you come to New Zealand. I took quite a few pictures and thought I was better get going if I wanted to make it tonight... As I headed towards the mountains I came across one of those yellow signs saying "kiwi crossing" .    Wow! I was on kiwi country! (They need a very specific environment to live in) I would never think of seeing one in the wild as they are nocturnal and very shy, but you never know... I took a side trip to Whakapapa (pronounce Fakapapa) up a long hill of 6 km on the side of Mt Ruapehu where trekkers do the very popular crossing of the mountain, being picked up on the other side by a shuttle bus. It was very tempting to do this trek but I don't have the proper foot wear and have to stick to my schedule. One of the hiker came back limping (she very likely twisted her ankle) even though she had the adequate ankle high hiking boots. As for me, it will be for another time. Have to come back. This side trip was... uphill but I was glad to huff and puff although I was wondering how high it would go. There was a gondola going up the mountain but unfortunately it was closed for the day by the time I came in.     Shortly after going back on highway 47 towards Turangi, I noticed that my rear tire was getting quite soft so I gave a try at putting some air in it but it didn't work out so well so I resigned to change the slow leak. As I was putting a patch on the tube, a car stopped and the woman offered that I use her foot pump. Sure, I said! This woman-a triathlete- just ran 36 km today in preparation of the Australia Ironman. Wow! How impressive! And... What a good idea! I will make some thoughts about it! Unfortunately for some reason her pump didn't work on my american tube valve but oh well, I am glad she stopped and she kept me company as I was doing the job, and we had a great conversation. Further down the road I stopped in a rest area and there was a couple busy picking stuff from the ground and I got curious as of what it was they were after. Well, this man, and Italian now living here with his NZ wife started talking faster than his mouth could move. It was funny because all I could understand was: Mama mia... Canadian... Mama mia... mushroom... Mama mia... Turangi... hill, big hills... Mama mia... His wife was smiling and so was I. I was delighted to see so much excitement. They honked the horn when they passed me on the hill. Yeah, the hill... After the rest stop there was a good size hill that required me to concentrate on my pace.I had to strugle with my small ring again and "the kick" had to be repeated a few times with some swear words in order to work. There were a few curves to the road so I couldn't see when the hill would end so I just kept going just in case the end was near around the next curve. It felt good to sweat a bit. The downhill was exhilarating but a bit cold as I made the last kilometers to Turangi. I stopped for a lookout for a nice view on Lake Taupo and everything around but I ran out of film so no picture... Boo woo... Made it to Turangi by 7PM and got to eat by 8. Definitly quite late but oh well, not so bad to get out of the routine once in a while, uh?
   There was a fair load of traffic on the road and had a close call once with a truck that really could have given me more space as there was 2 lanes and nobody beside him. I thought I could say today I didn't see any sheep but not a chance, nearing Taupo I saw hoards of them! Checked in at the motorcamp downtown, as I wanted a close acces to town, pitched my tent and headed for "Crater of the moon" which is a geothermal area. To get there there was a fair amount of climbing to do, then after riding on a small road, I saw a vast field with thick steam coming out of several spots on the ground.    The area was still green with plants , amazing that they can survive such hot grounds.    There was a walkway meandering the steamy land so we could view the craters and other natural phenomenons such as bubbling muds, boiling water, craters and also hear the steam exiting furiously the cracks of the earth.It was quite impressive to see and I took several pictures. Felt sorry there was no one to share with.      Randomly I headed towards other attractions a little out of town but didn't visit anything but a bee hive demo disguised as a tourist trap, then stopped at some waterfalls and was disgusted by the amount of tourists there as a big bus just stopped at the same time than me so I headed back to town.    I found an internet spot in Taupo and the connection was quite fast. I was impressed and glad. I had fun typing my report but lost the whole thing when the stupid machine wouldn't save my work and when I pressed the back button, wouldn't reproduce what I did today. The guy working there had a look and thinks it's MSN and not his terminal. This is totally frustrating. He charged me 2$ instead of 6 and I left, for food. Food would make me feel better! When I came back to camp, to my disarray and distress there was a couple of dozens of motorcyclists with their Harley that had checked in and had made their homes in the cabins nearest to my tent. Billy Idol's music was being played for the whole campsite and they were turning on and off the engines of their bikes and having scenic tours around the campsite. I didn't need that tonight. Put me in a foul mood. And it was only 5 pm. Was wondering what it would be like by 11:00 pm... So I decided to do something about it, I moved my tent and all my junk somewhere much quieter. I just want somewhere nice and quiet to sleep. The motorcamp has a kitchen but nowhere to sit inside and there are only 2 picnic tables outside for the whole camp. So I set up on one of the table and a guy joined in and although I didn't feel like talking felt in the obligation to maintain a minimum of conversation and small talk. It's one of those days, you know, and I just feel like doing my own stuff... No aggravations, please. Had pizza, yogurt and started into a bag of cookies. They are realy hard to give up even though I chose a type of cookies that aren't as yummy as usual. (Cookie monster me) I found refuge from people and mosquitos in my tent and will call it a day for tonight. Tomorrow will be my last official cycling day going to Rotorua as Sunday will be spent there and Monday is spent going back to Auckland by train. Kia ora from Taupo
         After that I headed towards Rotorua, more tired and having to negociate some hills and the traffic but it all went well. I was glad to make it to town, and found a campsite and took it. No playing fussy tonight. It's close to town, seems quiet but I can be wrong as you never know in advance what it's gonna be like at 10 PM. Splurged in a delightful nap once my tent was pitched , feeling very un-rushed. Eventually I got up and cycled to the internet cafe but unfortunately I couldn't access my web site. Hit the grocery store (am I getting boring???) and had dinner with a yummy chicken pie with steamed veggies and a few desserts (Haven't finished with those yet...)  Tonight is time change, we have to set out clocks back one hour. I'm glad to know this now so I don't get caught up on situations with the wrong time... However it means that daylight will be shortened in the evening by one hour which is kind of being cheated by one hour. That's bad... Oh well, I don't have any control on that...
       That was way cool! The guide also showed us the pools where they go bathe every day as there are no shower in their village, but in 5 houses. Very impressive.    After that I went for grocery and then internet work and the computer allowed me to update 2 more days to my journey which I am quite pleased with. I ended after 2 days because I was pretty annoyed with the music being played, some kind of dizzying techno where many times I thought the CD was jumping and repeating the same stuff.. Yuk. I had a headache so headed back home.  It's raining on and off, so will try the jaccuzi tub before the shower... Later... So it rained at dinner time. I tidied up my tent then went for dinner, the infamous caesar salad with couscous and a few healthier desserts. Now I have to be serious about it and decrease my food intake. No more of those big meals and no more multiple desserts... Chocolate will have to go too... Boo woo!!! I cleaned up both my food panniers, emptied my gas stove of the fuel by burning it and gave away my lighter. It's 7:30 PM and as tired as my body thinks it's 8:30 PM and feels it's time to sleep. Tomorrow I am taking the train by 1:00 PM and I have a little bit of time to do a bit of shopping and also some internet work. I have a few NZ$ left and I think I will have to exchange another 50$ Can traveller's check to get me going till Tuesday- food, camping, presents...  Well, I am really nearing the end. I have feelings of satisfaction. I think I had a pretty nice trip and that I did well considering the circomstances. I wonder what awaits me around the corner. What the challenges will be. Trials and tribulations.   
This thought is dedicated to the thief that stole the content of my saddle bag probably yesterday when I was doing e-mail. I didn't notice until this morning when I loaded the bike. So if I remember well, I had in it my tire irons, 2 flat tire repair kits, a small flashlight and my chain lube. I found the pocket fully opened and empty. Well I hope that the thief will make good use of those items. I had a good night of sleep and took it easy this morning but even then by 0830 I was ready to go! Not much is opened by this time but I went to the grocery store and bought enough for today and for the train trip. Then I had an intensive session on the computer, 1h30 and it cost me only 10.20$ ! I was allowed to get the bike inside near me so I was in peace with that. Didn't do much after that, not really wanting to leave my bike alone. I stopped in a book store and saw this guy roaming around my bike like a bee. I usually leave my bike unlocked in front of the glass windows in the small stores. But to be sure asked the cashier and she actually told me to put it right in the entrance so they could have an eye on it. I was thankful of the advice. I didn't find a book to read but would manage with the paper and bought some more post cards. By then it was time to head to the train station. The attendant there made me unload the stuff off my bike and I did, not wanting to make a fuss. It kind of bugged me a bit as it doesn't take much more room loaded than not, but of well. Whatever. So 4 hours in the train and I will be in Auckland for my last evening and last night in NZ. I would need to cycle 20 km to the motorcamp close to the airport. Another chapiter in on the verge to be finished... I need to arm myself with courage and determination to go through the next months as I will make some decisions for myself, like my professional future and build a better nest for my parrot and myself. I miss my parrot and can't wait to see him... Bla bla bla... Train babbling... I really should have got a book to read... 9PM. We made it to Auckland, a bit late, by 5:30 PM and decided to go downtown a bit to see the sailboats and cycled the 20 something kilometers to the motorcamp I have been to some 6 weeks ago. The sun turned out to be quite low by the time I started and I arrived in total darkness. It's amazing all the glass you find on the road and other sharp objects when you don't have any patch kits with you! When it got dark I put on my reflective jacket and turned on my rear flashing light, and really pushed myself. I was kind of worried by the heavy rush hour traffic and I guess worried of not being seen. But it all went well and got home by 7 PM, feeling relieved. Pitching my tent in the dark and looking for my headlamp in a bag full of clothes was a lot of fun, really! By now after 40 something nights in a row spent camping I could pitch my tent with my eyes shut. I opted for a shower remembering the sticky and stinky experience I had a few weeks ago and then had dinner. I lost a plastic red bowl here when I left the motorcamp- I don't know if I even mentionned it. Well, I was delighted to find it back! That was real cool! I had left-overs tonightm boiled veggies and cheese, and now beside an apple and a banana there is nothing else perishable. I am hoping to get some pastry for breakfast and to pick up soem sushi for lunch at the mall tomorrow. 48 hours away from my parrot and from home...
400g sweetened condensed milk 375g milk chocolate to melt 1/4 cup Kraft Crunchie Peanut Butter 1/2 cup chopped walnuts or peanuts 1- Combine condensed milk and chocolate in a saucepan, stir over low-heat until chocolate melts 2- Mix in peanut butter and nuts 3- Pour into a lined 28cm X 18 com slab tin and refrigerate until set. Like you see I had a very leisurly morning. I woke up with the sunshine and that was good because the tent fly was all wet, in and out. I needed the precious sunrays to dry my bike bag as well (which has been my ground sheet all along). I remember being glad my last day in NZ was a sunny one. It made me happy. I headed to the mall early to buy few things I needed. Treated myself with a muffin and a glass of milk and did half an hour of e-mail/web business. Bought some groceries and bubble wrap to protect my bike from potential rough hands at the airport. I bought some long time wanted sushi and also found a book to read while on the plane. After that, I went back to my tent for a shower and the final packing up. I enjoyed having plenty of time to do this and the sunshine...wow! was it ever hot! Here I was packing up, having just showered and I was already sweatting like crazy! The ride to the airport was fine, I enjoyed it but 2/3 into it I had a visitor stopping in front of me, and just for me... The police! A woman. Nicely she asked whether I knew I was riding on a motorway that prohibits cyclists or pedestrians. No, I replied, I didn't know, but I would be happy taking an alternative if she would be kind enough to show me a different quieter road to lead me to the airport. She said there was none, unless I would head back to Auckland and take a bike path which would be 2-3 hour detour by bike. She told me to carry on the way I was going but to be careful and to ride as far left on the shoulder as I could as the traffic could go quite fast. I said thank you and she left. I smiled. Even the cops are nice people in NZ! I had a "moment" arriving at the airport, for some reason. Don't ask me. Just full of emotions probably because I knew a chapiter of my life was just finishing. Didn't last long. I found a bench by the departures area outside and started the job of preparing the bike and my luggages for the journey across the Pacific Ocean and the Equator. Pedals gave me a bit of a scare but I had a long wrench that I have been carrying for 6 weeks just for that event so I did ok, didn't even have to use my instruction book to know which way to unscrew them. I was annoyed by the spot I chose as the smokers would gather nearbuy and bother me with their smoke. There was a wait time at the check-in area as it wasen't opened yet when I lined up. I happened to fall on a very unknowledgeable clerk as she pointed that I had too many pieces of luggage and that I would have to pay a surcharge for the excess of weight for my bike. So I had to review with her the rules of Canada 3000 and her co-worker gave the knod of approval so I was let alone and she checked in my stuff. Then I was rushed to take my bike into a narrow corridor to the fragile item area, and as my bike laid across the cart and I had carry-on to struggle with. I couldn't rush. I got ticked by the rush of the lady, and of course my bike would hit the wall or fall off the cart. Geeez! Give me some time, would you? It got me a bit irritated but that went away fast. After that started a shoping spree. Shopping with a vengance. I went through the stores, looking and looking again for 2 hours. Then I passed through the gates, the customs and wow, more shops. They got my attention (and my credit card's) up to the last gate .. So I am finally on my way home. Had dinner and started to read this book I bought this morning. And watched the Richard Gere movie presented: Autumn in New York. Nice. 21:30 NZ time. We landed in Raratonga (Cook Islands). My seat neighbor was a young guy travelling with his new wife for a belated honeymoon, and he's been suffering from motion sickness in the last few minutes of the flight to the Island. He was white like a ghost but near the end had a sweather over his head and a paper bag at his mouth...like if you had to be ashamed of motion sickness.. I tried some acupressure points on him but didn't work so well. I was glad he didn't throw up because the beef stroganoff wouldn't have been too  impressive half digested. I was a bit amused looking at him but I must admit I'd rather it was him than me... So we made it nice and clean to Raratonga and the opressive heat of the air rushed in as I got out of the plane. Can't imagine what it'd be like in daylight. It is so humid too. I guess it would be totally appreciated after a few months of -20 degrees weather but it's a bit too much to my liking. 06:25 Honolulu time. Probably 04:25 NZ time. So here I am living March 20th for a second time all over again today... Sunrise over Hawai... They made us get out of the plane so they can look for bombs and... uh... So they can clean the plane and bring the food in. Have had 2 empty seats to my left but even lying down I haven't been able to fall asleep. The 2 movies presented were not so good, a James Bond which I have no interest at all in and Fargo who is playing again probably because it's a Canadian movie. So I read my captivating book. Who knows, I might finish it before I make it to Vancouver... March 20th 2:00 Vancouver time, and March 21st 0900 AM Auckland time. One more hour to go on the plane and I'll be almost home. I have read a whole book since I left Auckland. It's a sad story and had to hide some overflowing water in my eyes many times. I like to read auto-biographies and true stories, like the Everest 1996 story for instance. This one was poignant, about a woman that learn she has inoperable brain tumor right after the birth of her daughter. She tell the story of her last year, with her husband contributing by his reflexions about his wife's on-line journal entries. That was heavy duty to read but very beautiful. This reading has one message for me, and it is enjoy life, and enjoy it now. Make a wish and just do it. It's happening today. And you make it happen because nobody will do it for you. So I am a tired cookie but still holding. I will be home soon. Beyond picking up my parrot I don't have much plans yet. I am working on Friday and already have few overdue things like a hair appointment, grocery shopping and cleaning my bike. Looking forward to having my ears cleaned up (I know, too much details) and telling all about my trip (already done), develop my pictures and talking to my family and friends (not necessarily in that order... or maybe, yeah!) I am looking forward to see my pictures and to scan them (stay tuned), to sort my mail out hoping there is not too many overdue bills and hoping there are a few checks waiting for me. 20:00 Home, sweet home... I arrived quite tired at YVR and somewhat impatient and irritable waiting in the slowest of the line-ups at the customs. Some people have been jumping queue amd other have been quite confused as for what to do. No patience for that today. I want home... I decided to pick up the parrot tomorrow, well rested instead of today and to cycle home. I put my bike back together having difficulty screwing the pedal because I was unscrewing (duh), loaded the thing and rode home. I am pretty happy I did that. Just what I needed after 18 hours on the plane. It relaxed me and gave me a good work out as I pushed myself quite a bit. I got comments from other cyclists like... "You have a lot of panniers on your bike" Uh, yeah...I do... I go to work every day loaded like that...
I recovered my parrot the next day and he happened to be fine, little bundle of joy as he is. Of course he remembered who I was. Was pissed off at me for leaving him with the doctor that prod and gives him needles, but apparently he was just fine. I made life changing decisions after this trip like changing field of practice within nursing, so that kept me busy and stressed for the months afterwards. I guess that my trip refilled my energies enough to dare making that much needed change. New Zealand is a country of fast terrain changes, very compact in itself, and like the guidebook I was usign say, a peddlers paradise. It is not crowded except for the sheeps and the increasing cow population (did I also mention sandflies?) but their people are very friendly. I will come back, that is for sure. Go see for yourself, you will be impressed!

When we moved to Boulder in 1992 I joined a hiking club.  We would pick a different hike every week and usually summit 12-13,000 foot peaks.  At 40 I was the baby of the group.  Most of the women were in their 50's, 60's and even 70's.  What a great inspiration they were to me.  We are blessed that in Boulder we have so many active seniors who are out there doing it all and I thank them for the great role models that they have become.   My husband, Doug has been the biggest cheerleader this past year.  Last September when I turned 49 he gave me a bicycle charm neclace and told me that there was no turning back.  This past year has been consumed with research and discussions about my ride.  Every new idea has been thoroughly hashed over and he has shared the joys and accomplishments along the way and has also been there when the tears flowed over the dam.  His biggest challenge now will be to boot me out the door when I ride through Boulder in late June. Thanks Honey Bun! I also want to thank our kids who have encouraged me along the way.  Last summer Jennifer backpacked Europe all summer and now this summer I will be on the road. I told her it's her turn to wake up in the middle of the night and wonder where her mother is!  Thanks, Mark for the logo design, it is awesome.  Kudos also to Chris Wesselman who stepped in to help with the techie stuff when Doug was on the West Coast attending school. You saved my life and now I can sing along to Italian Opera when I'm in the cornfields of Iowa!   I have been so blessed to have such wonderful support and backing from all my family and so many of our friends. I take numerous angel pins and a very precious rock with me for good luck as well as all your love in my heart. "Live to ride, ride to live."   
HOT BATHS-If you like hot baths at the end of a long ride like I do you should carry a rubber bath stop.  I don''t have one so one night we stuffed a wash cloth in the drain (which worked) and another night the plastic lid from a Pringles can did the trick. CAMELBACK WATER PACK-A few days before I left someone who has ridden cross country three times told me the most valuable thing to have is a Camelback so I took her advice and got one.  I also have two water bottles but the Camelback works so well, especially when you are working up a grueling hill and can hardly move your hands to swat a fly.  The water hose with the bite valve is right there. Usually at lunch time I add ice so I not only have ice cold water but the pack cools my back as well. BED & BREAKFAST INNS-Try to stay at B&B's if possible. It feels so much better and is just like being at your Grandmother's house. A hearty breakfast is served each morning and the cost of lodging is sometimes cheaper than a budget hotel chain.  The proprieters are very friendly and a good source for local information. GORE TEX RAIN CLOTHES-Spend the bucks and invest in Gore-Tex. You will probably still get wet, more from sweating on the inside but the Gore-Tex does breathe and you will not get cold.  Make sure that your underlayers wick the sweat from your body as well.  I have a jacket designed for bikers and good rain pants with side zippers and velcro closures around the ankles. DRINKING WATER-Your source for drinking water will vary every day.  Always taste the water before filling up your bottles and Camelback.  I filled up at a gas station with tap water from the bathroom sink one day and five miles down the road, with another 15 miles to go I realized that the water was not fit for human consumption.  It was horrible and I was afraid it would make me sick.  Needless to say, I was very dehydrated at the end of that ride.  I should have purchased bottled water-well worth the few dollars. CLEAN CLOTHES-If you can, rinse out your clothes every night.  Even in clean water, if nothing else.  Putting on smelly clothes in the morning is not fun and I think the sweat and salt can be abrasive on sensitive parts of your skin.  Most materials are made to dry very quickly. RAILROAD CROSSINGS-After my latest wipeout with a roaring train bearing down the tracks with me inches away, crashed and clipped into my petals, I propose that as you approach the tracks you unclip in anticipation of needing to stop quickly. FOOD-When you leave for a ride make sure that you have some type of nourishment in your packs.  Even if it's something you aren't craving at the moment. Believe me, when you get to that town that you thought had some kind of gas station or grocery store and its' a ghost town, you will be happy you've got that boring granola bar or apple in your pack. CELL PHONES-If you carry a cell phone try to get in the habit of recharging it every night so that you have the added insurance of a full charge in the morning.  Recharging every night does not hurt the new cell batteries.  If you have a phone that is analog and digital you will go through a charge much faster when you are on analog.

I know that a lot of you have been asking about my route.  I had hoped to scan one in but that did not happen (maybe later) (Mark L.??)  So, I will give you a quick rundown of my planned ride so that you have a better idea of where I am going and if you happen to start getting postcards from Texas you better come find me!   Leave New York City on May 11th and head north along the Hudson River.  Cross over into New Jersey at the George Washington Bridge. (that should be interesting!) Head north and ride through New York, along the Jersey border and head to Port Jervis, NY. From there we will ride towards Scranton, PA and then into northern Pennsylvania and follow Hwy 6 across the state, heading into Cleveland where Doug will fly home from on May 25th. Then I will be alone for a bit and will stay fairly north central through Indiana and Illinois and stop in Mt. Pleasant, Iowa to visit my sister, Diane Rouse and her husband, Mike. My parents, Joe and Gladys Tupy will sag me with their motor home from somewhere in Illinois through Iowa. Get those kolacky's ready, MOM! From Iowa I will dip down through a small bit of Nebraska and Missouri and take Hwy 34 across Northern Kansas and into Colorado. I will stop in Boulder for a bike and body tune-up and some serious family and friend time.  Then a posse of Boulder friends will join me over Trail Ridge Road in Estes Park. Doug will continue with me to Steamboat Springs.  From there my sister Cindy Tupy will take over and ride with me through a bit of Utah and into River Falls, Wyoming.  The baton will then be passed to Doug and Christy Speirn-Smith who will ride/sag to Pocatello, Idaho where Christy's brother lives. Then I will be alone again for a bit so I want to ride through the Sawtooth Mountains of Idaho and then stop in Boise to visit friends, Betty and Allen Frazier.  Allen, get the plane ready, maybe we'll fly over the Sawtooth's instead! From Boise I will head due west through central Oregon to Florence, on the coast. My cousin Margaret Carfi and her two friends will ride with me the last 600 miles to the Golden Gate Bridge, with the able assistance of her husband Ron. So, my next tome will be penned in NYC.  I will upload more photos once we are on the road! P.S.  I just weighed my duffel and it's a nice, light 24 pounds so I'm pretty happy about that.

We left the hotel at 8:45, again, not an early start but who wanted to go out in pouring rain.  We actually rode in rain ALL day long.  Doug had two flats. The first was at mile 5.8 so we stopped under a hotel awning to change it.  The second one started going flat a few miles later and I noticed a bike shop about a half mile back so we walked the bike back and had a whole new tire put on.  Apparently the spoke liner was worn and not protecting the tube from the spokes.  I think the problem is solved; now if I can just stop falling off my bike! The rain poured and poured.  We continued  on, heading towards Scranton.  Around 7 we stopped for dinner, knowing that a hotel was within a few miles. I cried through the whole dinner, knowing we had to go back out in the rain and cold and I was so miserable I just wanted to go home.  We mounted the new front light to Doug's front fork and headed up the hill, only to have the damn light fall off twice but we had street lights and numerous cars honking to tell us we were nuts.  But within two miles, there was the Dunmore Inn.  A warm room and shelter over our heads, nothing fancy but at 10:00 who cares.  We decided to sleep in until we woke up and agreed that no matter how far we got tomorrow we were stopping at a decent time. Total miles today was 61.  Yeah!

There is nothing better than the smell of bacon and fresh coffee in the morning.  Ruth filled us with french toast, bacon and English muffins and  by 8 we were on our way.  We hope to get to the hotel in Cleveland that is close to a bike shop that will be boxing Doug's bike before he flies home. We are way ahead of schedule; Doug was supposed to fly home on May 25th. It is a warm and balmy 27 degrees when we leave and around lunch it is probably a high of 40.  The clouds keep spitting little drops and snowflakes but so far no downpour. I am doing everything in my power to delay the inevitable but nothing is working. Towards mid-afternoon the clouds diminish and the sky turns blue.  It is still chilly out but we are relieved that there is no rain.  We approach the outskirts of Cleveland and the traffic gets heavier. The worst is the condition of the roads; the potholes are enormous and if you don't get off your seat there is major pain.  We wind our way through the streets of Cleveland and ride through downtown and head towards North Olmsted, which is where our hotel  is for the night and also where Eddy's Bike Shop is. We check into our hotel and just a bit up the street is Eddy's; we get there around 6 and by 7 they have my bike tuned up and Doug's bike boxed.  They give him a ride back to the hotel and then we go next door to have margueritas and a delicious Mexican dinner to celebrate. I cry through most of the dinner because I am now realizing that starting tomorrow this ride is all mine! My buddy is going home and I am on my own-what a scary thought.  But I am taking tomorrow off-Doug's flight is at 5 so right now all I want is my snuggle partner and a warm bed!  Nighty night!   

What a day!  I left the hotel at 7:00 with butterflies in my stomach. My biking buddy was gone and the day was here. The sky was bright blue, a little breeze blowing.  I followed the directions Doug and I had written out and before I knew it I was on a route that was posted PEDESTRIANS AND BICYCLES PROHIBITED!  I kept going but my good old Catholic conscience kept knawing at me so I stopped at a gas station and asked a few people for an alternative route.  They couldn't think of any and told me the other route was even more heavily traveled so off I went, (mea culpa, mea culpa)wondering what the local jail food tasted like.  But no flashing lights or sirens and before long I was in beautiful Ohio countryside. The shoulders are still in horrible disrepair, which makes looking around a little difficult. A lunch stop in Milan, OH, which is the birthplace of Thomas Edison.  I've already gone 40 miles.  Finished at 2:30, 64 miles.  I wish every day was this good!   
Bicycle touring has always held a fascination for me.  You take only the bare essentials and then rely on your muscles to get you from point A to point B. After a few weeks you get the routine down and things become sort of mechanical.  Eat, ride, drink, pee, eat, ride, drink, pee........BUT, there is so much more to it.  I started my ride this morning at 6:30.  It was so beautiful out. Once I got off the busy road and onto a country road I started really looking around and taking in all the sights and smells that one can only observe by being on a bike.  As I approached one small town I was riding against a line of cars that were all heading to work in the other direction.  I knew what they were experiencing-flipping radio channels trying to find a good song, worrying about being late for work, making mental lists of what all had to be done that day.....And here I was, just pedaling my bike on a country road in Ohio.  I became intoxicated with the smell of fresh cut grass, I heard birds chirping all around me, I smelled the fresh turned earth that was being prepared for planting, a small airplane flew overhead, a car passed and I could smell the perfume the driver was wearing, a cow mooed in a barn, baby sheep were munching new grass in their pen, a farmer's wife was doing laundry and I could smell the clothes dryer, a car passed me and the driver honked and waved, a burst of scent from some lilac bushes, oh yucky-another road kill, the sound of a rushing river, fresh silage being put into a farmers' silo, the breeze blowing and cooling my face and the smells from a bakery as I passed by. (And yes, I did stop for a cup of coffee and a maple cream bar!) WOW, intoxicating is right.  I was in heaven and so happy that I was where I was!   So, that is all I have to say for today.  It was my longest ride so far and I am exhausted but content.  I have a beautiful room at the Augusta Rose Bed abd Breakfast in Napolean, OH and I will sleep like a baby.   
I left later than usual today. I wanted to stop at a library but the Napolean one was not opening until later so I headed to Defiance.  I arrived there by 11 and spent a leisurely hour checking emails and looking up some travel quotes that I like to use.  The weather was overcast but quite warm.  Well, I pushed my luck and within a few miles of leaving Defiance I was in a rainstorm.  But it was actually very pleasant.  It was warm and the rain was falling very softly.  It felt so good on my face. Grandma Tupy used to catch rain water in a bucket and she used it to wash her waist long hair.  She said it was the best for washing hair.  Well, today I got everything washed!  I'm sure she was smiling down on me; seeing how much I was enjoying it.  Within an hour I had biked out of the rain.  I was going to only go about 40 miles today but when I got to Paulding I didn't like peoples' comments when I told them where I was staying so I continued on to VanWert, a little out of my way, but I am now in a nice, clean room, showered, laundry done and ready to go for dinner next door.  Life is good!  I'm sure my good luck won't last forever so stay tuned for more exciting journals.  I'll see what trouble I can get into!
I cross over the Ohio/Indiana border and by twenty miles and a few little rain showers I have stopped for hot chocolate at a gas station.  The lady informs me that it is only 8:30, not 9:30 as I am now in Central Time.  I'm feeling pretty good about having that extra hour.  My plan was to only go to Huntington, IN but by 11:00 A.M. I had in 50 miles and I was within 7 miles of Huntington so I got the maps out and decided to aim for Wabash.  In the middle of nowhere I pull out my cell phone and call ahead to the Lamp Post Bed and Breakfast.  The owner, Janet Conner tells me she will hold a room for me.  I have about 20 some miles to go and am already looking forward to a nice, 4 poster bed.  About the time I start pedaling again the wind kicks up a notch and I am reduced to 7-8 M.P.H., disappointing after I was sailing along at 15-18 all morning long. I have to say, the Indiana people are very, very friendly but the dogs did not do very well at doggie obedience school.  I was chased by at least 8 mutts and only by my screaming NO, NO, NO and kicking up the speed a notch was I able to lose the little and big rascals. One guy caught me totally off guard, I didn't see him coming and I almost went into cardiac arrest. The funniest were the mutts that were tied up to a leash but started chasing me anyway.  Yikes, that must hurt when you realize you are at the end of the rope!  Serves em' right! And yes, I was humming that damn song all afternoon! So, as I'm fighting the winds I am slowly making progress towards the Salamonie River State Forest.  The roads get a little hillier and the rain clouds are threatening.  As I am crossing the dam I start to feel a few drops so I stop to put my raincoat on. A little further I can sense that this is not going to pass so I stop to put my rainpants on.  Within a few minutes I am in the most incredible rainstorm.  It was coming down in sheets.  I kept pedaling, shuddering with each roll of thunder and crack of lightening.  It was raining so hard that I could literally feel my shoes filling with water.  In the midst of this I had to stop under a tree to consult the map as I was within 7 miles of my home for the night.  Good thing my map was waterproof!  I worked my way out of the park and the rain starts letting up.  But wait, I think I have a flat tire.  Of course, the rear flat.  So, I pull over to a grassy/muddy knoll and get to work.  The tire comes off, the tube comes out and I have one more good, unused spare.  I quickly replace the tube and start pumping in air.  In my haste I forgot to open the end of the pump that fits over the Presta valve and proceeded to pull off the valve end, PPPSSSSTTTT, there goes all the air!  Deep breath, swear words, OK, start over.  This time I had to use a tube that had a patch on it.  That quickly went in, got everything put together, packs mounted, trailer hitched and I'm ready to go.  But wait, what is that bump, bump, bump every time I pedal?? I don't see anything obvious so I get my map out and see that there is a bike shop in the next town.  I call there and get some advice.  I am told that perhaps the tube has a kink which is causing the wobble. Well, I press my luck and decide that I can handle the bumps if I ride slower.  Well, the bumps didn't like the bumps and within a few miles I had another flat.  OK, I am no longer having fun.  I stop at the edge of town to go pee at a gas station/diner.  As I'm coming out of the bathroom Frick and Frack are sitting in a booth.  Frick says, "Where ya headin', or are ya just out riden?"  I look at them both and tell them I'm doing a cross country ride.  Frick says, "Where did ya start?", and at the same time Frack says, "Where ya goin?"  I said, New York City to San Francisco and they both unanimously say, "HMMM."  It was hilarious.  I needed that to keep me going the last mile that I had to push the bike to the B&B.  I was anxious to get there and find some shelter to change the tire. I knock on the door and am greeted by this sweet, sweet smiling lady. I ask her where I can change my flat before coming in and getting cleaned up.  We go around back to her garage.  I start to get disassembled and her neighbor, Steve Porter comes over.  The are both helping with rags, a bucket of water and tons of questions.  An hour or so later the task is complete.  I still have a problem adjusting the rear brake but that will have to wait until tomorrow.  I decide that I will spend two nights here and take Sunday off like I had promised myself when I was planning this adventure. I shower and Janet and I walk downtown and have dinner together. The funny thing is, I am still in high spirits and blessed with such  wonderful, caring people that are there at the right moment.  I fall asleep to the smells of banana cake being prepared for tomorrow's breakfast. Sweet! F.T.C. Gladys 2   
I share a wonderful breakfast with Steve and Jo from Milwaukee, WI.  Before long Steve is in the garage with me, helping me fix the brakes.  What have I said about people coming into my life at the right moment?  I get goosebumps thinking about it.  We say goodbye and I join Janet for Sunday church services at the United Methodist church two blocks from her home and then we go out for lunch.  I spend the day cleaning my bike, making phone calls, plotting over maps and arranging my lodging for tomorrow night. Sorry, no adventures today but wait a few days, I'll see what I can dream up.
Happy Birthday to my Dad, who, with Mom, has spent his birthday on the road, leaving southern Minnesota and heading to Illinois to meet up with me and be my sag support for a while.  Thanks, Dad!  Mom, start cookin,' I'm eating like a horse these days! I hugged my new friend, Janet, goodbye.  I felt like I had known her for a long time.  I headed back north to catch the Adventure Cycling route west.  I thought that I had only 50 some miles to go so I putsed along, stopping frequently.  Everytime I would stop at a farm with cows or horses the animals would slowly amble over to the fence to check me out.  Some of them were more interested than others and we had a few chats.  I was on country roads almost all day so lunch was a Luna Bar and trailmix.  By early afternoon I realized I would do more than 50 miles so I picked up the pace but I also hit some very bumpy roads and a section under consruction that was covered with loose gravel. My rear tire decided to start losing air so about every 2-3 miles I had to stop and add air. I wanted to get to my Inn to change the tube so I could put it in water to find the leak.  I finally arrived a little after 4:00, changed the tire, showered and went to dinner. I'm going to get a beer belly if I'm not careful.  I've never liked beer much, but at the end of a long day on the dusty trail a beer tastes so damn good! F.T.C.  (Flat Tire Count) 4 "Afoot and light-hearted I take to the open road.

I stuck my thumb out and it felt so awkward that I immediately withdrew it and as two trucks passed I thought to myself, 'that's OK, I really don't need a ride.'  Here I was, a woman just three months shy of 50, a grandmother; hitchhiking!!  I sucked up some courage and tried again.  This time a bright red pickup truck came to a screeching halt right behind my handicapped bike.  I accepted a ride to a town 11 miles from where my tire went flat.  I had no good spares and no patches left.  When I arrived in the town of  Brook I was dropped off at the Farm Equipment Store and between them and the local hardware store I was able to buy a patch kit, fix both tubes, have a nice lunch and hit the road.  I think I met every resident of Brook that afternoon.  I continued on, touching base via cell phone with my Mom and Dad who were driving east through Illinois.  By late afternoon, two more flats and an afternoon downpour I was close to our meeting spot.  We kept calling each other and at one point it was like a scene from the Keystone Cops.  "Where are you?"  "I'm on 52 West heading to Ashkum."  "OK, we'll be right there."  Two minutes later- "OK, you're not there, are you really on Hwy 52?" Somehow we managed to find each other.  Finally I see a beautiful Winnebago off the side of the road. I started crying and waving in excitement.  I had finally found the Tupy Traveling Hotel. And what a beauty it is. Brand new, only one week old and it is a luxurious home on wheels with all the amenities you could ever need.  It will be a treat not to have to hunt for loding every night for the next week.  Not to mention my Mom's great cooking and Dad's expert bartending.  OK, now I want you all to know that I know how much you enjoy my misadventures but this has got to stop.  I know that you are a very demanding bunch but it would be OK if one of these days I wouldn't have much to say. I'm sure that some of you think that I am making all this up-I wish I were that creative.  Rest assured that none of these stories are embellished.  My goal for tomorrow is 85 miles so we'll see.

Well kids, today was probably the most normal day a bicycle tourist could ask for.  Other than head winds and a slight uphill road, it was a pretty uneventful day.   But let me tell you, if you are ever on a bicycle tour and have the luxury of being sagged in a motorhome-do whatever you need to convince the owners to sag you. Promise them the finest scotch, steaks, whatever it takes.  It is worth it!  I am enjoying this so much. Honey, my birthday is coming up, what color should I order? Mom made a light breakfast and I was off.  By 11:30 we met in Dwight, IL and had lunch together.  Than Mom and Dad went ahead to Streator to get set up at the campground.  By 3:30 I was enjoying cheese, crackers and a cold beer.  (So far no beer belly).  Do you notice that so much of touring revolves around eating?  I have a voracious appetite and I think I'm actually even losing a few pounds.     
The 10 mile section of road leaving Henry had a Road Closed sign at the intersection but I decided to ride on it anyway.  I didn't see any activity indicating road work..........until about two miles down the road.  Then I saw a sign that said "Fresh Oil."  Oh, a biker really loves to see that.  I had visions of my lime green bike jersey looking like a leopard at the end of the day.  But by then I was committed. The worst thing a bike tourist wants to do is backtrack, and the oil was covered with a fairly even coat of heavily crushed sand.  (I know there is probably a special word  for the sand but I don't know it.)  I continued at a pretty good pace and was happy that there was almost no traffic. I approached the top of a hill and was stopped to plug in my earphones to listen to music.  Then I saw in the distance a truck coming up the hill but I also noticed what looked like a biker in front of the truck.  And sure enough, I think I was about to meet my first bicycle tourist of this ride.  As we passed each other we turned around at the same time as we realized we were both gypsies on the road. We stopped to talk.  I asked him where he was headed and before we knew it we were shaking hands in amazement that we both lived in Boulder, Colorado! His name is Manfred Schwoch and he is biking to his 50 year high school reunion in a small town in Indiana.  His wife is sagging him in a camper van. Our meeting kept me going for many miles today.  I was totally inspired by him and felt even more convinced that this is what I really should be doing.   I arrived at the campground after 4:00 and was very, very happy to be done for the day.  85 degrees so it was hot, windy, dusty and hilly.  Sort of like poking a needle in your eye all day long, but I'm still smilin.'
I left earlier today, hoping to avoid the terrible heat of the afternoon. At 7 A.M. the bank clock said 72 degrees!   I headed west on some roads and south on others so I had a break with the winds.  Not as hilly as yesterday, either.  About twenty miles out, on a nice, smooth country road I was watching these cute little black birds. They had a red marking on their backs and there seemed to be a lot of them.  All of a sudden I could see ones'shadow right over my head and it was dive bombing my head.  After a bit another one would take over. I swear they chirped over to the next electrical line and passed the harrassment on down. At one point I took my bicycle pump and starting madly waving it in the air.  I'm sure the car that passed me at that moment thought I had lost my marbles.  I felt like the guy in the "Karate Kid" movie, trying to catch flies with his chopsticks.   Eventually they got tired of me or perhaps I was out of their territory. (True story in case any of you are wondering if I am making these up!) In the little town of Henderson, IL I stopped a car at a stop sign for directions.  She was very helpful and about 5 blocks away she had turned aound to come back to give me better directions. By 11:30 I was at 48 miles and approaching the town of Galesburg.  I stopped at a gas station for ice water and a break.  I asked about a campground  that was supposed to be in the next town over.  Several guys gave me directions.  A few minutes later one of the guys came back to clarify a few things.  I started on my way and then stopped under a nice, big, shade tree for my lunch.  Before I knew it I was sound asleep! Wow, that felt good. I continued on towards the town with the campground and all of a sudden, in my mirror I saw a big pickup truck with its' flashers on, and it wasn't passing me.  At an intersection it pulled up beside me.  It was the same guy from the gas station that helped me earlier.  He had his wife and son with him and he had made some phone calls and located the campground so he drew me a very detailed map on how to get there.  He had an enormous USA flag mounted in the back of his pickup truck.  Good people in the state of Indiana! Time for that cold beer!
We woke during the night to an incredible rain storm but by 6AM the sky had mostly cleared.  I left byh 6:45, anxious to beat the heat but more anxious to get to my sisters house in Mt. Pleasant, knowing I could put the bike away for three nights!   Just before I crossed the mighty Mississippi River at Burlington, IA I guess Illinois was giving me a kick in butt with a flat tire.  This was a flat tire that had the new, super duper, heavy duty inner-tube in it.  I had a new spare so quickly changed it.  You would all be quite impressed with how fast I can change a flat!  My mother brought me some bright purple surgical gloves so I'm sure I looked the sight, changing my flat wearing gloves.  Hey, I hate greasy hands!   I crossed the river and then met my parents at Bickels Bike Shop in Burlington.  I put a new tire on the rear as the original one had several puncture holes in it and the new one is a little heavier.  They told me that it's possible I am having so many flats because my tires were very underinflated.  I was told in Boulder I did not need a tire gauge but bought one today because I thought I always had enough air in the tires but I guess not. Back on the road and arrived at my sisters by 1:30.  My clothes are already washed and dried.  Thanks Sis!  And I even shaved my pits and legs and curled my hair today!   Now for some serious R&R! F.T.C. Gladys 8
    
Before hugging my sister goodbye I told her we were not going to cry.  Besides, who could cry hugging a weirdo like me, wearing a bike helmet with a turtle glued to the top!   Diane cooked and together with Mom and Dad they all helped with my repairs and errands. It was nice to spend some time together and we did a lot of talking and laughing.  Thanks Sis! Today I awoke to the smell of coffee and quiche.  How can one lose weight when assaulted with the wonderful smells of a good cook's kitchen? I felt so rested this morning and it felt like I had been off my bike for ages.  Who ever said Iowa was flat?  Yikes-today was like a mini version of Pennsylvania.  I call them turtle hurdles.  But I made very good time.  About 35 miles out of Mt. Pleasant I was on a road that had a sign that read, "Iowa Amish Trail."  It was a county road with very little traffic.  Soon I saw an Amish buggy coming toward me.  Inside were a Mom and her four children.  They had on bonnets and straw hats and the children seemed very shy and would not smile. A little further down I observed two different homesteads where the mothers were out in the garden with the children.  I felt like I was intruding so I just waved and took a mental picture. Five miles down the road, as I'm slowly working up a hill, I noticed a black speck in my mirror that kept getting closer to me. I turned around and saw that it was a horse and rider, at full gallop, coming up right behind me.  As they got closer they crossed to the other side of the road to pass me.  It was a beautiful 10 year old Amish boy with the biggest smile on his face.  In his left hand he was holding the reins, in the right he had a brown wrapped package and his straw hat.  He had probably been returning from   the post office in town.  He turned onto a driveway in front of me, all the while smiling; probably excited about what was is the package.  His mother was working in the garden.  I felt like I had gone back in time. It was a very beautiful and peaceful scene.  I arrived at the campground around 3:00.  Mom and Dad arrived a bit later and we shared another wonderful dinner.  Now I am icing my knees.  They are bothering me a bit so I don't know if I have to lower my mileage a bit, ice them every night or pour scotch into my Camelback water pack.
I left the campground around 7:30 and had only gone a few miles when one of our camper neighbors stopped me in his truck.  He saw me leave and was worried that I was going to backtrack and he knew of an easier way to get to my main route so he jumped in his car and came to find me. He and his wife lived in the area and were at the campground with their two granchildren.  I am so blessed that there are so many friendly people in this world.............. But, I AM FINALLY GOING TO VENT!  (Oh yeah, finally some good stuff!) But I will warn you that if you don't like swear words you should take your little mouse and fast forward to the next paragraph.  I was on Hwy 2 heading west and had no shoulder. I was in the middle of an uphill and saw a truck coming towards me and one in my rear mirror.  I tried to stay as close to the white line as possible.  The trucker behind me kept coming and before I knew it both trucks were meeting each other with me on the right shoulder.  He was so close I could feel the truck almost brush by my arm.  I could not believe the rudeness of the asshole trucker that he could not wait and pass me safely. I was so angry and upset.  What was the rush?   I was wishing him all kinds of ill will- 'Damn you, I hope you get a flat tire today, that you stub your toes when you get up to pee tonight and that the IRS audits you because I'm sure you are the kind of dead beat that has not paid your taxes for years!'  I also was thankful that his behavior was in the minority among truck drivers.  I saluted the next trucker as he passed me and gave me all the space I needed.   OK, that feels better.  The happy news is that at 6PM my son Mike and my two grandbabies met us in Leon, IA.  Yes, they are my grandbabies even though they are 8 and 4, they will always be my grandbabies.  I was greeted with many hugs and kisses and am so happy right now.  We are going for ice cream right now! So, today had a good ending.
As I waved a tearful goodbye to my Mom and Dad I had two little cheerleaders standing at the end of the hotel parking lot shouting, "Go Grandma, Go."   Mom and Dad, I just want to tell you how special it was that you were able to sag me for the past 9 days.  I had such a great time and felt very pampered.  Each day I would look forward to seeing that beautiful motorhome parked under the trees at the campground.  Inside would be a cold beer waiting for me and a nice snack before dinner.  I slept like a baby every night and will have wonderful memories of the time we spent together.  Thank you for all that you have done.  I will miss you both very much. Today was a short day so I could spend as much time with Mike, Austin and Nicole.  I had a pretty hilly start the first half of the day.  By noon I only had less than 20 miles to go and the hills became a little gentler so I plugged in my Disco music.  Wow!  You should see me dancin' on the bike.  It's quite interesting and I might have to take the show on the road!  It's a pretty new routine and I checked my mirror before dancing to make sure no cars were coming. It was hilarious. It's amazing what one can do to pass the time on a bike.  I was getting tired of counting the bumps on the road today so the dancing was a nice diversion. I know, I'm whacked!! I met my son and the kids at 2:00 and we stopped to get some beer and then took Austin and Nicole to a park.  Later we went to the hotel where we spent the rest of the afternoon swimming.  Now we are going for dinner.     
Another tearful goodbye today but I was also so happy that I was able to spend two days with my son Mike, and our grandchildren, Nicole, 8, and Austin, 4. We slept in this morning and after breakfast went swimming.  I repacked all my gear and after lunch we were driving to my drop off point in Bedford.  Took a few pictures and then I was off. I'm so used to riding in the early morning and by 1:30 today it was in the high 80's.  I only biked to Maryville, MO because I could not find lodging any closer to St. Joseph.  As it was I had a hard time.  The winds were from the South/Southeast and I was heading South!  Of course! Plus I haven't had to haul my gear for the past 11 days.  What the heck is in all these @!?# packs anyway? I'm working on a poem about the wind but I have to try and delete some of the swear words.  When I do that there is not much of a poem left!   
I left the hotel by 6:30 this morning, trying to beat the heat.  Much slower going with a full load but making forward progress.  At around 2:00 I saw this car in the other lane, honking the horn, waving at me. The car quickly turns around and I realize it's my crazy sister Marlene.  She jumps out to get a sweaty hug and then runs back to her car.  She comes back with an ice cold wash cloth.  Do you know good that feels on a 90 degree Kansas day?  We loaded up her car with my trailer and panniers.  Now I was cruising along at 18 MPH instead of 8.  Yeeh hah! NOTE:  If you go back to the Table of Contents I have added a chapter on The SIMPLE THINGS IN LIFe.  I will add to it as I think of things.  I have also added a chapter on LESSONS LEARNED. Mostly for those of you who may be crazy enough to be considering doing a cross country tour. Anyway, my sister is here with me now for the whole week.  We are spending two nights at the Majestic House, a Bed and Breakfast in Atchison, KS, birthplace ofAmelia Earhart.   The Majestic House was built in 1890 by the brothers of Saint Benedicts Abbey.  The home is out in the country and is beautifully appointed with antiques.  The owners Jan and Junior have 5 guestrooms in the main house and are restoring the old barn which will have 20 rooms!  The house pet is a cute, white fluffy dog named Muffy who loves to pull weeds in the yard. After my ride today we stopped for fresh fruit, bread, cheese and wine and had a picnic dinner out on the grounds of the Inn.  It was a warm summer evening and later we soaked in the hot tub and watched the fireflys.  Back in our room there was a tray of fresh baked pecan cookies and ice water.  I'm telling you, life just doesn't get any better than this. After a running jump to get into the high bed I think it took me 30 seconds to fall asleep!   
A fresh cinnamon roll scent woke us up at 8:00. That was a snack before a breakfast of pork chops, scrambled eggs, farm potatoes and fresh biscuits. Do you notice how much I talk about food? After breakfast we went to Sunday church at St. Benedicts in Atchison.  When we got back to the bed and breakfast to gather some munchies and Marlene noticed that my flag pole had broken off of my bike.  It only had the Illinoisand Iowa flag on it but I was pretty bummed so as we drove back towards town we backtracked where we thought the flag may have broken off yesterday.  Sure enough, there it was by the side of the road so I was happy about that.  Then we went to the Amelia Earhart Earthworks where her profile is in the side of a hill and made out of different grasses and rocks.  Later we drove to the little town of Weston, Missouri.  We browsed amongst the antique shops and sampled McCormick vodka's and liquors.  On the way out of town we spotted a sign for Pirtle Wines so we sampled some wines, bought a bottle of wine and sat outside in the vineyard having another picnic.  You know, this trip would be a lot of fun in a car!!  Just kidding, but today was a very nice, fun day.   
I could have sat and visited with Jan and Junior for hours this morning but forced myself to get going around 7:15. Marlene rolled over and enjoyed the morning at the bed and breakfast while I worked the hills of Kansas. Damn, everyone kept telling me how flat some of these states are but THEY'RE NOT!! But, by noon I had 50 miles again and was enjoying my lunch under a tree.  By 12:30 what was a very humid but cooler, overcast day turned into a steam bath.  I felt like I had just stepped into a tub of sugar water-sticky all over. And the winds kicked up a notch, coming from the South/Southwest.  With 15 miles to go I turned North and had a blast. The wind was blowing straight north and literally blew me to the top of the each hill.  With 7 miles to go I met Marlene approaching on the other side-pushing her bike up a huge hill, against the wind. I told her she had to bike if she wanted a beer after. Man, you should have seen her fly! So.....Pssshhh......Aaah...... yup, it was a cold one. Now we are sitting at the laudromat, in front of a fan, having afternoon cocktails, trying to think of humorous things to put on this page :):) I must apologize if you are looking for the nitty gritty of biking.  After all, what can one say about biking?  It's a way to get from one end of the state to the other end and I really enjoy what happens before and after the biking.  Yes, I enjoy the smells, the animals, the views and the fresh air but I especially enjoy the people I meet and the things I see. So, Boulder get ready, I'm comin' home and I'm hug deficient!   
Marlene drove me from Seneca, where our hotel was, to Centralia, where I stopped yesterday. We had just left the hotel and heard a strange sound towards the back of the car.  I was worried that one of the straps was loose on the bike rack so we pulled over.  As Marlene got out of the car a jogger was passing by, pointing to the top of her car where her very large and heavy purse was!  At 6:30 am it was very humid and the skies were rumbling. By the time we got the bike off the rack the lightening bolts were striking as well.  We debated what to do and decided I would start out and pray a lot.  At 5 miles I pulled over to put on a windbreaker and within 10 minutes I was drenched.  The thunder and lightening was all around me and I kept trying to make myself small, hoping the bolts would find a more desireable object than little ole' me. Maybe it was the bright green jacket that did it but soon I was out of the rain.  I love the feeling of being outside right after a rain storm.  The smells are wonderful.  Marlene caught up with me after checking out of the hotel and we met for coffee in Frankfort. I started out again and soon after had another rainstorm. This time it cleared up and I could feel the thermometer just go crazy.  It's amazing how much more tiring it is to ride in hot, humid 96 degree weather.  With 25 miles to go Marlene met me on her bike to finish the day.  We took a break at one point at a little roadside rest area. There was a pickup truck parked there and Sis noticed a cooler in the back of the truck. She walked over and did not see anyone in the cab so she snooped in the cooler.  It was full of beer! We commiserated for a while about how much money to put in the cooler for two beers.  After checking again she realized there was no ice and the beer was warm, and since we still had 8 miles to go we decided to pass.  The heat was definitely affecting our behavior and luckily we are now in our comfy hotel room instead of the Clifton Jailhouse. The only dining establishment in town was Brett's Club. The lady at the hotel suggested it.  We opened the door and had to be buzzed in to the second door. We should have known-Brett's CLUB!  The minute we walked in some guy said, "here come the dancers." Yeah, right, you're a loser!  The gal at the bar said that if we wanted to have dinner there we had to be a guest of someone or pay $10.59 to join! This was hilarious.We told her Roberta from Newell's Country Lodge sent us there, so she said, "Oh, well then, you can have dinner here."  As we were leaving another guy came and asked us if we were the bikers going cross country.  Word travels fast in small towns; good think we didn't hock the beer from the pickup truck! Our exciting evening ended with a stop at the only gas station in town for some Kansas Cashball lottery tickets.  I've already checked the phone book for a Harley Davidson dealer.   
Oh, what a day!  I was in the saddle at 6:15 and just cruisin' along.  Marlene met me 2 hours later in Concordia for a good, old fashioned breakfast at the downtown cafe.  I continued on and with a nice wind from the North/Northeast I felt like I was flying.  I met about a hundred bikers going in the opposite direction that were with the B.A.K. group.  (Bike Across Kansas)  I had 61 miles by noon and Marlene met me with 11 miles to go.  We stopped in Cawker City to see the world's largest ball of twine!  (Yes Dan, we took a picture!)  Boy, that was momentous!  We also stopped at the library/City Hall and were the first users of the libraries new computer.  It only took them an hour to figure out how to turn it on.! On a more serious note-I have now biked through a good representation of America's breadbasket.  What an eye opening sight that has been.  I have seen farm machinery designed to hold huge tanks full of fertilizers and pesticides that is being sprayed on what will become our bread, cornflakes, soy products, crackers, cookies, etc.etc.  The machinery has hazardous material signs on the back. And it's being sprayed on our food?? That in turn is being filtered through the soil into our ground water, lakes and rivers. Not to mention the same sprayed crops being fed to the meat that we consume. It was a very upsetting sight.  And we wonder why cancer and other diseases are so common. What can we do about it?  I know for sure that I will try to buy organic foods more often now and I know we can all support our local farmers' markets that sell organic fruits and vegetables in the summer months. If we don't support them they will go out of business.  At breakfast this morning I noticed a man with a baseball cap with the following written on it: Avoid Cholesterol, preservatives, carcinogens, pesticides, and starve to death!  HHMMMM.  Perhaps we all need to read (or re-read) John Robbins' Diet For A New America. And add to the reading list, Fast Food Nation as well. Tonight we are staying at the Howell House Bed and Breakfast.  The owners are Steve and Joan Heide and Steve's sister lives in Boulder. A very comfortable bed and breakfast in Downs, KS.   
This morning my sister actually left before I did. She wanted to get a head start and get to Phillipsburg early so she could then get on her bike and ride towards me.  That was the plan, anyway.  I left the B&B about 30 minutes after she did.  Within 5 miles I was in a huge downpour, soaking wet. I had only taken my windbreaker-my raingear was in her car-DUH! We talked on cell phones and Marlene decided to turn around and come back.  When she got there I crawled into her car like a wet puppy-dripping all over.  It was pretty cold so I changed my shirt and socks and put my rain gear on. Sis decided to stick close by in case of severe weather.  Another 15 miles and the rain was letting up.  I thought only Colorado had weird weather. As I was biking along at one point I saw a bagel in a baggie, attached to a road sign with duct tape.  I knew who the culprit was as I loaned her my duct tape yesterday so she could attach a second water bottle to her bike!  That amazing duct tape!  We met for lunch at a small town diner and she still had time to go ahead to the hotel, check in and then ride towards me to finish the day. What a sister! I am so blessed.
Oh I hate goodbyes.  Today was the last day that my sis was with me.  I started out early again and Marlene drove ahead to Oberlin.  She jumped on her bike and met me 18 miles out so she did 36 miles today!  Northwest Kansas is rolling hills but it was a beautiful day, much cooler since yesterday's rain.  We finished around 2:00 and celebrated with onion rings and a rootbeer float at A&W.  Tonight we are staying at the Landmark Inn, a bed and breakfast in a renovated bank building.  The owner is also a chef and we had dinner in the Teller Room. Tomorrow Marlene has offered to drive my trailer and bag to my hotel in St. Francis, KS-due west of here about 70 miles and then she will turn around and head 630 miles northeast to go back to Minnesota.   So, goodbye sis and thank you from the bottom of my heart.  I had a great week with you, lots and lots of laughs and girl talk about every subject under the sun. I appreciate you taking your time to drive all through the Midwest to sag me and take such good care of me.  I love you dearly but please don't embarrass me by taping bagels to street signs-you might get picked up!     
At 5:00 am we were awoken to a hard rain and then hail.  My watch alarm went off at 5:50 which I turned off, rolled over and went back to sleep.  Marlene's alarm went off at 6:15 and she did the same.  Finally at 6:20 I decided it was inevitable that I had to hit the road and send her on her way as well.  We were out by 7:00 and she went ahead to St. Francis to drop off my stuff.  Then she came back towards me and we had breakfast together before our sad goodbye. I will let the pictures do the talking today.  My only diversions were the tumbleweed that blew across the road and big, black bugs that were scurrying around on the side of the road.  I put my music on and that helped pass the day.  I also crossed into Mountain Time so I gained an hour but I am staying at one of those super budget motels and this is one day I would have been happy arriving late.  I swear to God that my parents stayed here with us kids in the 50's and they haven't redecorated since then-brown, yellow and gold shag carpet, bright gold paint on the walls, mustard yellow bedspread and the window air-conditioner that will lull me to sleep!  Yikes!  But a nice surprise was the cold beer and fresh cherries waiting when I arrived.  Thanks, Marlene! Anyway, I am ready for the mountains and some new scenery-bring it on! Happy 52nd Anniversary to my Mom and Dad!       
I was anxious to leave Kansas and head for home.  My hotel experience got even worse last night when, at 3:39 A.M., a very noisy cricket found his way into my room through the door and proceeded to serendade me for the next 3 hours.  Each time I would turn the light on to try to find him he stopped creaking. At 4:30 I considered getting dressed and heading out but I really wanted to sleep.  So, at 7:00 I left, which was really 6:00.  Remember yesterday, I THOUGHT I was already in Mtn Time so when I went to dinner at 6:45 I found out it was really 7:45 so I was all screwed up.  Anyway, within 22 miles I was in Nebraska which lasted for about 8 miles.  I needed breakfast but both tiny towns in the Nebraska corner were ghost towns.  I crossed the Colorado border, stopping to take a picture of the "Welcome to Colorful Colorado" sign and calling my husband and daughter to share my excitement with them. (Neither one answered their phone-oh well!) About 8 miles further I stopped in Wray, CO to get my late breakfast at a 7-11. While there I met my second bicycle tourist.  And guess what? He was from Colorado also!  Vern is from Denver and had just left yesterday, heading to Lincoln, Nebraska on a one week tour.  So far, Colorado bicyclists rule! My room tonight is a lot nicer and so far no crickets!  Jennifer and her friend Chris are driving to Fort Morgan tomorrow to sag me for two days so I am very excited to see them.
Man, I got my butt kicked today!  I left Yuma at 6:30 but it was already 63 degrees.  Colorado gave me a warm Welcome Home with head winds coming from the west.  Every pedal stroke was painful. The miles ever so slowly turned over on the computer. I kept drinking water and after 13 miles stopped in Otis for breakfast. I put my music on but the wind was so strong that I had a difficult time concentrating on the songs-forget about singing along!  Yikes, what a day.  I pulled into Fort Morgan at 2:00 and the bank building showed 99 degrees and the weather channel said the wind gusts were up to 16 miles an hour.  I'm beat! My daughter Jennifer and her boyfriend Chris borrowed my Miata and drove to Fort Morgan tonight so we had dinner together and they are sagging me for the next two days into Boulder.  It was so good to see them.  She is a nanny for the summer and also cashiers at Whole Foods Market in Boulder so this big road trip is the highlight of her summer.  Hey, it's Mom's turn to play-last summer she was in Europe for three months!
I think I was half asleep when I asked the hotel manager how to get back on Hwy 34 to head to Wiggins,CO. She sent me in the opposite direction and after two miles I realized I was headed to Greeley-opposite direction of home!  So back I went and found Hwy 34.  I have to tell you, there is a huge difference between a sagged tour and a self contained tour.  When I began planning this ride I knew that I would have to haul my own gear but I am not a purist or into self torture and I have been so blessed with all the support that I have had so far.  But, one can get spoiled when someone else is carrying all your gear. I was just cruisin' today at 15 miles an hour. Jen and Chris came by at 48 miles and we found a shade tree in Prospect Valley and they had fresh olive bread, cheese and grapes for lunch. Where was the wine, Jen?? I only had 21 miles left and as I biked through Hudson I noticed a railroad track sign.  I always slow down before the tracks to check them out.  This time, however, I got right up to the tracks and noticed a huge, enormous gap before the track so I thought, 'oh shit, I better get off the bike and walk across the tracks.' I was almost at a stop and once again, realized I could not unclip.  So, down I went! Except this time, I immediately heard the RR gate come down-BEHIND ME!  I looked left and just around the corner I saw the train!  My front tire was inches from the track.  A gentleman in a truck shut his motor off and quickly came over to help me.  I unclipped and we moved my bike behind the gate and WHOOSH, there was the train! Woah, this was a little too close.  So, another biking lesson learned. From now on I promise that I will unclip before I cross the tracks!  My elbow bled like crazy and has a huge bump on it. My saggers were waiting for me at the hotel so Jen patched me up and now we are going for a movie and dinner.   

      
So let me tell you about the 'Trail Ridge Challenge'. When I was working on my routing I decided that I would take more time and a scenic route and see the sights I really love.  I knew that I wanted to ride through Boulder so it also seemed 'natural' that I would go through Rocky Mountain National Park and on to Steamboat Springs.  Which also meant going over the only road through Rocky Mountain Park-Trail Ridge Road. I put the challenge out to several Boulder biking buds and had two takers. Doug Speirn-Smith and John Accardi. Of course I think the most enticing aspect for them was the promise of beer and burgers after the ride. These two guys are serious, serious bikers and to them going over Trail Ridge Road is a warm-up ride and to me it was comparable to scaling Mt. Everest.  This morning Doug and I drove back to Estes Park from our cabin and met Doug and John at a very early 6:30A.M. We started out at 7:10 A.M.  A beautiful morning, cool temps and no winds. I do have to add here that my husband Doug and Doug's wife Christy said their goodbyes and then headed into Estes for a breakfast of omelets, crepes, and cappuccinos while we were sucking down powdered energy drinks.  HMMMM.  Not fair!! Trail Ridge Road leaves the beautiful city of Estes Park from the East entrance to Rocky Mountain National Park.  The climb is a  4,500 foot gain in elevation starting out at 7,500 feet and peaking at 12,020! John and Doug paced me at a nice even speed as we immediately began to climb.  We stopped frequently for photo moments, water, snacks and potty breaks.  My newest addition to all the other 'stuff' I haul on my bike is a squeaking turtle that is mounted on my handlebars. Thanks, my dear girlfriend, Christy.  This turtle came in very handy today.  Instead of hollering "car back" each time I saw a car in my mirror I would give the turtle a squeeze so the guys would know.  However, there were times I was concentrating so hard on the climb that I forgot to holler or squeak!  Before we knew it we were at 11,000 feet.  What incredible views and what a gorgeous day.  A little more climbing and then we were met by Doug, cruising by in my Miata convertible to take a few pictures and at the summit we stopped at the visitor's center for a nice lunch. Unbelievable that we had gotten to the top so quickly.  Of course, we were the center of attention as people marveled that we actually rode all the way on bikes!  As we passed some people they just looked at us and shook their heads.  Soon the clouds were threatening so we donned rain gear and started the steep, curvy descent down the other side of the mountain. What a gas that was! We crossed the Continental Divide, (another quick photo op) and kept on moving as we saw the rain clouds following us.  We rode through a few rain showers and arrived at the Grand Lake Lodge at 1:10 in the afternoon. And as promised, burgers and beer were the reward of the day.   In the afternoon we said goodbye to John, Doug and Christy and were joined for the rest of the day by Rick and Karen Sinner.  We browsed the shops in Grand Lake and then went back to Grand Lake Lodge for cocktails on the front porch swings overlooking Grand Lake and a wonderful dinner to end a very memorable day. Thanks to all my great friends for making this such a fun day. I am truly blessed!  And thanks to my partner Doug who took another week off from school to be in Boulder when I came through.

Another morning of goodbyes.  We said goodbye to Rick and Karen and then I got my honey off at 7:30.  Decided that I would just relax at Grand Lake Lodge instead of rushing off to Kremmling.  Visited for a while with a very sweet couple from Flagstaff, Arizona. They were very interested in my ride and were on a two month car trip, heading to Minnesota where they used to live.  I did a little bit of computer work and then around 10:00 I realized I needed something to eat.  I packed up and wanted to enjoy the brunch at the lodge but it was closed.  So I stopped in the town of Grand Lake for a late breakfast and then headed to Kremmling.  By 11:00 it was very warm and very windy but I covered my miles in a little over 3 hours, but I don't think I'll stick around next time.  I much prefer riding in the early, cool of morning.  I must admit, there is nothing to do here in Kremmling and I don't have internet access tonight so it's TV for me.
After a good nights sleep I was on the road at 6:45.  Even though the daytime temps get very hot the evenings and early mornings are very cool.  Perfect riding weather.  The terrain around Kremmling is high desert with large ranch farms and the mountains in the background in a beautiful morning haze.  I was in no hurry so I took my time and enjoyed the sights. I was on a very mild grade going uphill most of the way.  At about 20 miles I notice two riders gaining on me from behind so I stopped and pulled over to meet them.  They looked like pack mules-totally loaded where you could barely see the bikes.  Poor guys!  Joe and Jeff were with 16 others riding the Transamerica Trail with Adventure Cycling; having left Virginia on May 5th and heading to Oregon by early August. They are camping all the way so they have to carry their camp gear and the group shares in carrying all the camp kitchen items and food.  We visited for a while and then met further up the road to take pictures at the Continental Divide-Muddy Pass, where they turned off and headed northeast and I headed up Rabbit Ears Pass and down to Steamboat. Joe said Colorado was his favorite state so far-I would definitely agree with him.  I worked my way up Rabbit Ears Pass and just loved the beautiful views and wildflowers. I was rewarded with an 15 mile down hill ride into Steamboat.  I had to stop several times to rest my hands from all the braking I was doing but what a blast!  Now I an resting at a condo that was graciously given to us for two nights by Doug and Christy Speirn-Smith.  Thanks again, guys!  You're the best!  My sister Cindy will arrive this afternoon to ride with me for a week and coincidentally my son James is here with his girlfriend, Jill for a wedding, so we will have dinner together tonight.       

What a way to leave Steamboat-we left the condo at 6:40 and just two blocks away we saw 2 hot air balloons getting filled in a large field.  We pulled over and watched until they were airborne.  Then we found a bike path that took us into the downtown area where we stopped for cappuchino and bagels.  It was a very cool morning so we headed towards Craig and enjoyed the rollng hills and rock formations.  By 11:00 we were within 15 miles and the heat was back.  Very interesting how cold it is in the morning and within 6 hours it is 90 degrees but the low humidity makes it more tolerable. At one point we were working up a hill and I noticed a little blue stuffed character on the side of the road.  It was Cookie Monster from Sesame Street. I hung him on Cindy's bike but then across the road we saw a pile of colored stuff so Cindy went over and turns out it was the rest of the Sesame Street gang.  It had been a crib mobile and was missing a few characters.  Cindy pulled off Big Bird and hung him on her bike.  I chose Elmo and Ernie.  Neither one of us wanted Cookie Monster so he got tossed back in the ditch.  Later as we were going through Craig a lady honked her horn and told me I lost something at the intersection.  It was poor Ernie, laying in the middle of the street.  Cindy went to rescue him and he's back on my bike. I have so much 'STUFF' hanging on my bike it's a wonder I make forward progress. Cindy was an awesome rider today and it's fun having companionship.  Not to mention it's amazing what sister talk about! Tonight we are staying at the Deer Park Inn in Craig. This afternoon we went to the Museum of Northwest Colorado.  My good friend, Kristy Horst from Boulder, taught in Craig a few years ago.  I won't say how many. But, her picture was in the museum and I am including it on this page.  For those of you that know her, please call her and give her some grief about it, ok?       
His name is Bill Perry.  He is the reason I am doing this ride.  And the reason that I ski, snowshoe, hike, run and scuba dive.  I want to be just like Bill when I grow up.   We met on Hwy 40 heading west towards Dinosaur, CO.  Cindy and I had about 20 more miles to go in our day and we were working up one of the many hills in Northwest Colorado.  All of a sudden up ahead we saw that a large, white Cadillac had pulled off the road just ahead of us.  Out jumped this happy, vibrant man.  He quickly approached us and asked if he could ask us a few questions.  He wanted to know all the details.  "Where are you going?  Where did you start?  What kind of tires and bike do you have?"  I quickly surmised that he was also a biker and he said, 'yes,' he and his wife Barbara were headed to Salt Lake City where he was doing a triathlon. He also told us he was going on a bike trip to Ireland this fall!  Then he told us he was 81 years old!!  He looked like he was 60!  What a joyful man.   Today was one of those days that you would sort of rather forget but yet it was such an unforgettable day that you know you will always remember and retell the story many times. My watch alarm went off at 6:00 am.  Cindy stirred a bit so I asked her if we should just sleep in a bit as we were planning on only riding to Maybell today-an easy 30ish miles.  We both went back to sleep and didn't awaken until 7:30.  We had a leisurely continental breakfast in the hotel lobby and finally pushed of at 9:00 A.M.  We enjoyed the morning and casually strolled into Maybell before noon.  Maybell is a hopping metropolis with one restaurant, one gas station, and two hotels.  We checked out the hotel that was suggested by the lady at the gas station. It was comfortable but we wondered what we were going to do in Maybell for so long.  We went for lunch and over lunch decided that we were going to go for the gold today.  Another 55 miles to Dinosaur.  It was 1:00 by the time we left and the heat had kicked up a notch.  We had a difficult hill heading out of town and soon realized that there were many more hills where that came from.  We were in the high desert with not a shade tree in sight.  We were told that there was nothing in the town of Elk Springs but a few shade trees so after 20 some miles we saw the sign for the town of Elk Springs, and sure enough, there was a small grove of shade trees off the side of the road. It was 4:30 and sweltering hot.  We found a few tufts of grass and within minutes we were both sound asleep.  By 5:30 we were back on the road; refreshed but tired and sore, knowing we had another 25 miles to go. With 20 miles left we met Bill.  I needed that boost of energy and  inspiration that he brought.  We kept battling the hills and the heat.  I counted close to 100 fire vehicles that passed us, heading west to battle fires in the Flaming Gorge area of Northeast Utah.  At 16 miles to go we see a white Cadillac approaching us.  The car turns around and pulls off in front of us again. It is Bill and Barbara.  Bill tells us that there is absolutely nothing in Blue Mountain and that we need to make Dinosaur before nightfall.  We thank him for the update and continue on.  By now it is around 8:00.  We can smell the smoke in the air from the fires and watch the bunny rabbits scurrying around off the side of the road.  At one point we are surrounded by huge Mormon crickets. The road is thickly covered with them.  I hate crickets!  We pass the 79 mile mark on my computer and I whoop with joy.  I have broken my daily mile record for this ride. We also know we have only about 6 miles to go.  But wait, is that Bill in his Cadillac again??  Yup, he's turning around!  We worry that perhaps the road is closed due to the fires.  He jumps out of his car again and comes back to tell us that he has made hotel reservation for us at the Terrace Hotel in Dinosaur and that we are almost there. We smile in amazement at such kindness and know that this has been a very, very special day.   
Well, good thing today was a low mileage day. Our bodies felt sluggish and slow, even with only 34 miles. I guess 86 miles will do that to you.  We left Dinosaur around 9:30 and after some stops at the CO and UT Dinosaur Visitor Centers we arrived in Vernal, UT around lunch time. We found a hotel with a nice outdoor pool and spent the afternoon doing laundry, soaking in the warm pool and taking a little nap. We keep getting updates on the fire that is out of control in the Flaming Gorge National Recreation Area at the UT, WY border.  One of the two roads going north into Wyoming is closed.  The other road is extremely steep and longer but that is the road I had planned on taking anyway because it is probably more scenic.  The fire is the #2 priority in the nation.  The trucks passing us yesterday seemed to have an urgency to them as they flew by us on the highway. So we plan on leaving very early tomorrow and seeing what happens.  We decided that we would hitchhike over the mountain if the fire poses a real health hazard in terms of breathing. Something new every day!     
What a spectacular day!  What an incredibly hard day! We knew we had high miles to do today so we were on the bikes before 7:00.  Within 5 miles of town we were climbing, knowing that would be the norm of the day.  Little did we know how much and how hard.  The first sign was an indication-it said, "5 percent to 8 percent grades, 10 switchbacks, 9 miles."  We painstakingly worked through the climb but that only took us into the heart of the mountains.  The whole day was pretty much a continuous climb. Around noon we were so tired of climbing that we stopped at a rest area and fell asleep on the black top next to the bathrooms!! The only thing that woke us was a fire ranger who pulled up in her pickup truck.  She probably thought we were dead! We had a nice lunch at the Red Canyon Lodge and thought that would energize us for the 25 miles we had left but we were slowly losing steam no matter how much water we drank or what kind of food we ate.  Just after lunch we saw two bike tourists across the road.  We stopped to say hello.  In broken English we found out they were from Germany and on a one year bike tour from Seattle to South America. Their bikes were very rudimentary; again, loaded down like pack animals.  No helmets, wearing Teva sandals, but looking very fit.  They were camping along the way and commented on how much they missed German food. Wait till they get to Mexico!  Refried spaetzle? There was a nice 5 mile downhill overlooking the Flaming Gorge Reservoir which as always, was fun.  Around that time, as we saw more hills, Cindy took two spills within 30 minutes of each other so now she has war wounds to take back home with her. We were both so tired that we laughed ourselves silly. The last 6 miles were mostly uphill into Manila; that is always very hard at the end of the day.  I was becoming severally overheated so I pushed my bike for several miles and then dug deep to finish.  No fireworks tonight. Our hotel has a lot to be desired.  No A/C, the shower drips constantly and our dinner was a cold beer, Pringles chips and a bag of fresh cherries! Yum! Hope you all had a great 4th of July.     
I always knew this bike ride was really two seperate rides.  New York to Boulder and Boulder to San Francisco.  Well, I think I was right.  The mountains are.....mountains. What else can I say?  Hill after hill after hill.  But, I have also been very spoiled so far with so many family and friends helping me haul my gear.  These past five days I have hauled my B.O.B. trailer and full panniers and it is HARD, thigh burning work!   The alarm went off at 6:00.  Cindy says, "I'm not getting out of bed.......unless you bring me a warm washcloth."  So being the good older sister, I lured her out of bed and we got going. We headed due north on a sunny, already warm morning. Within a few miles we were snapping photos at the Welcome to Wyoming sign.  Five miles after that the road sign read, "Loose Gravel."  We were able to keep riding but not for long.  Gee, we haven't had a flat tire for a while and we wouldn't want to get out of practice, right?  Rear tire flat, of course.  Close to where I had the flat we saw several large road construction earth movers so we pulled up next to one to use as a prop and also for shade.  With two extra hands the flat was quickly changed. We continued on. The 45 mile stretch between Manila and Green River was high desert. Very hilly and not a single thing for shade.  It was extremely hot and hard. To amuse ourselves we discussed what we would want if we came across a palm thatched cabana off the side of the road.  Pina coladas, rum punch, ice cold watermelon and cold cantaloupe filled with vanilla ice cream were the top picks. We stopped in Green River for a late lunch and decided to go the extra 15 miles to Rock Springs.  Cindy is flying home from Rock Springs on Sunday morning so now I have two days off instead of one. I have to say, my Mom and Dad raised some tough girls.  Cindy, you are awesome and one tough biker dude. I have had a great week with you and will have many fun memories.  Thanks for sharing this week with me.  I hope your bruises heal and that your coworkers don't laugh at your cute biker tan.  I Love You! SIS F.T.C. Gladys 9     

My support crew is relentless!!  Another changing of the guard today. Cindy left early yesterday morning and my bestest girlfriend, Christy, arrived from Boulder at 3 in the afternoon. The main thing that kept me going today was the promise of fresh olive bread, cheese, cherries, olives and a nice bottle of white wine. And chocolate, of course! This morning I was on the bike at 7 am.  It was a beautiful, high desert morning.  Rock Springs has the second largest number of wild horses in the USA.  Soon after I started out I saw a dusty trail off to the East and was so excited. My heart was beating so fast, the dust tail was coming towards me and I could almost see the wild horses heading in my direction. I was ready to stop at any moment and snap a ton of photos. I kept waiting, waiting. Turns out it was a pick-up truck on a dirt road!!  Bummer! Anyway, our destination today was an easy 40 miles to Farson, WY. Christy met me at 10 miles out of Farson on her bike and tried to gently tell me that the hotel we had reserved was a dive.  It was only 9:50 am; so we pulled in to the hotel and talked to the owner.  We told her that we had decided to continue on towards Pinedale.  (Actually, no continuing, it was do or die because there was nothing between Farson and Pinedale except 58 more miles of road!)  She was OK with canceling our reservation so on we continued.  Shortly after that the winds kicked up; head winds of course!  I kept on grinding away.  But it really wasn't that bad.  The scenery was so beautiful and the mountains kept getting closer and closer.  Christy met me a second and third time and by 4 we were finally pulling into Pinedale. 98 miles on the odometer!  I am amazed myself, today I feel like the bionic woman! The hotel was on the north end of town so we stopped for a beer and had a 1/2 mile to go to get to the hotel.  And as promised, a delicious Italian spread; showered and in my wild zebra pajamas!  Life is good!  Truly!   
Have  you ever gone somewhere where the scenery is so beautiful that your eyes can't take it all in?  That you look and look and wonder and realize that nothing man-made could ever compare in beauty?  I have been blessed in my life with many memories like that.  Some of the ones that stand out are seeing the deep blue glaciers of Alaska, the bright red, yellow and purple coral under the sea, the sun setting over the ocean on Seven Mile Beach in Grand Cayman, a loon gliding across the water in the Boundary Waters of Minnesota, and the vineyards of Italy.  I am lucky that I live in Colorado and can enjoy the mountains whenever I like but there is no greater appreciation and wonder than seeing them on a bike.   I left Pinedale at 6:30 this morning and had a slow, gradual climb for about 28 miles.  The snow capped Tetons and Rockies almost surrounded me.  At every turn there was another beautiful view.  Christy met me at 2 different points today.  She drives ahead and then gets on her bike and heads towards me. At the second stop she surprised me with something that every biker and hiker must have!  I call it my Neck Weenie. It is like a bandana but is sewn like a tube. You soak it for 30 minutes and it has a gel inside that puffs up and stays cool around your neck.  It feels so good when it gets very hot out! My friend takes very good care of me! We had a wonderful tailgate picnic after I had a nice down hill coast for many miles;  then I had another 20 miles left where the road meandered, with gentle hills along the Hoback River. I finished at a nice early 1:00 in the afternoon. We are staying at the Hoback River Resort, right on the river, where the owner Kathy is a very sweet, accomodating hostess.  She even let us do our laundry in her washer.  I hate hand washing clothes, so thanks Kathy.  In the afternoon we headed into Jackson for some power shopping. I have been shop deprived this summer because whatever I buy I have to carry and I knew Christy could take my treasures home in her car.  Actually, I only bought a pair of slacks. We had dinner at the Blue Lion restaurant.  Very tasty Idaho trout. I'm happy that I am back in fresh fish country. Night, night!     
It was a very crisp 40 degrees this morning when I left Hoback Junction.  It has been a while since I have had to wear my fleece shirt, fleece beanie and long fingered gloves.  Summer weather in the mountains is the best.  The days can get very, very hot but the nights are so cool.  We slept with the sliding door open a bit so we could hear the river. I headed north towards Jackson and about 7 miles out of town there is a path for bikers, bladers, runners.  I was amazed at the amount of traffic at 6:30 in the morning.  Mostly workers bees on their way into town. All the tourists are still snuggled in their motorhomes and tents and lodges. The path was much hillier than the road but I was surrounded by the mountains, fields of horses and wildflowers.  I met Christy at Jedediah's for breakfast.  Their specialty is their sourdough bread. Yum! Here I go talking about food again! I continued on and just outside of Jackson as you turn the bend the Grand Teton Mountains stand shockingly tall and majestic.  I couldn't help myself and kept stopping to take photos.  The airport is north of town and it was neat to watch the airplanes taking off with such a background.  At about mile 33 Christy met me at the Snake River Lookout rest area.  We saw several rafts going by.  We took a few more pictures and planned to meet in 10 more miles.  Christy didn't ride today.  Afer breakfast she found herself a physical therapist who helped her with a sore neck that she has had for a while.  She also needed to get a part repaired on her bike.  So, I guess no beer for her today! We met around noon at the Moran Junction Entrance to Grand Teton National Park. I racked my bike and we drove out of the park to the Cowboy Village Resort at Togwotee.  Now we have a nice, quiet, restful afternoon before tomorrow's exciting entrance and ride through Yellowstone. Here Moosie, Moosie!       
Of course the first woman on the list is the biker babe Gladys!  In the four days I have been with her she has reaffirmed the strength, grace and fortitude I knew she had all along, but to see it in action is a sight to behold!  She literally jumps out of bed every morning, packs up and is ready to roll within 30 minutes!  I have now seen her ride up 7 to 9 percent grades in 90+ degree heat, pee incognito in the woods faster than you can say "whiz", dodge RV's on the no shoulder roads of Yellowstone doing 30 miles an hour down hill, and on threat of having to stay in a cat smelling 4x4 room ride 98+ miles in one day. In every minute she is energized, smiling and truly enjoying all the moments of the day. Nothing is too much for her or too great a challenge. I am so very blessed to share this unique and special time with my dear friend. The second incredible woman is a physical therapist by the name of Noorene in Jackson, Wyoming.  Waking up with a locked up neck (what's wrong with this picture-I've been riding for 2 days and Gladys has no injuries and has been riding since May11?) this biker/sagger would have been "road kill" if it wasn't for her wonderful spirit and hands.  As the Gladys Karma (as I call it and of course it is all so good) follows us, Noorene had a cancelation first thing in the morning and I was back on my bike within 2 hours! But that's not the whole story. Noorene gave me exercises to relieve my strain and I am now a devout biker climber...she pointed out that climbing is so much easier on the neck and shoulders, and she was/is so right!  Give me the hills! Trail Ridge here I come!  The final incredible woman is Mother Earth!  As I reveled in my "new" neck and headed into Yellowstone National Park I was climbing up my first really big hill of the trip.  Because I go so slow I had a lot of time to look around...the landscape was very inspiring. Everywhere you looked great old pine trees stood without their needles or cones-just bare spirals against the deep blue sky standing straight and proud after having lost their lives to the devastating fire of 1988.  The smell of charred wood was still in the air in such a subtle way.  But looking deeper, beneath these monuments to time, a carpet of the sweetest smelling grasses, wildflowers- and yes- 4 to 6 foot lime green pine trees! What a miracle to accomplish so much in only 14 years!  My time flew as a climbed that mountain!  So...three women, all with such special gifts to give and I have the great pleasure of knowing them all...  Gladys writes: Today was a spectacular, awesome, rich day.  I left my drop off point and around the first bend I came across three buffalo. Two female and one  very virile looking male.  I screeched to a stop and unclipped my left foot, ready to reach for my camera. Right then I saw the male look up at me. Granted he was in a meadow a ways off the road but there I was, all ablaze in my bright green windbreaker with no piece of steel between us to safeguard me.  I'm telling you, we were making eye contact so I high-tailed it down the road. I told myself that I had to settle for a picture in just my mind so sorry about that!  5 miles later Christy was waiting for me at the entrance to Jackson Lake Lodge.  She asked me if I saw the moosie just down the road.  I missed it but I was happy that she got to see one.  I stopped at the lodge to get a cup of coffee and admire the Grand Tetons through the massive windows in the great room.  I continued on and the traffic got heavier.  Christy again met me at the entrance to Yellowstone for more photos and we racked the bike to get through the toll booth and save ten bucks.  By now the road turned to a tight two lane road with absolutely no shoulder. And yes, I did dodge the RV's as they rumbled on by. I did a lot of praying during that section.  17 miles out I met Christy again for lunch and from that point on the shoulder was a little better but my energy was zapped. I had some pretty good passes to go over-I crossed the Continental Divide three times!!  Christy met me on her bike with about 4 miles to go and escorted me into the Old Faithful Inn where I was lucky enough to see Old Faithful erupt as we were pulling into the lodge.  What a marvelous day that I will never forget.     
  
Another early morning to take advantage of the cool morning air.  Just outside the hotel as I was leaving I saw a lone buffalo grazing just off the side of the road. I bravely took his photo and was close enough to hear him tearing off the clumps of grass.  Being on a bike brings you close and personal to all things outdoors. But I didn't linger long.  Just last week a visitor was flipped by a buffalo as he was walking in the same area so I didn't want to press my luck.  The ride through West Yellowstone was beautiful. Flat and downhill all the way to the West entrance. I stopped at the Fountain Paint Pots to watch the bubbling mud ooze out of the earth.  This area is amazing.  I saw a huge male elk wading in the water, an eagle, and geese. Christy also saw a coyote. Once through the west entrance I rode through a tiny bit of Montana and then reached Idaho.  Now I only have 3 states left and in a few days I will break the 3,000 mile mark so I guess I'm making progress. My buddy rode with me for a total of 30 miles again today. It is always nice to see her smiling face on the other side of the road.  We reached our hotel at noon and I had 52 miles so I decided that I would put a few more miles on to reduce the 90 mile day planned for tomorrow.  When Christy arrived with the sag wagon it was 104 degrees out!  Many hotels in the area aren't air conditioned but luckily ours is.     
Wow, there is nothing like a flat road, no headwinds and a cool morning.  I just had the best time today.  I averaged 15.4 miles per hour.  That may not sound like much but for me it's huge.  A few miles out of Idaho Falls I saw a flock of 11 geese flying above me.  I was very intrigued by them because they were just up there playing.  I had to stop and get off my bike and watch them.  They just kept flying around, doing different formations and acrobatics. They stayed in the same airspace the whole time.  Five minutes later they went off in a V formation.  I would never have been able to see that if I had been in my car! And I sort of felt like a bird today-so fast and free!  Awesome! We got to the hotel by 12:30 so we showered and went to a movie, shopped a bit and had a great Italian dinner. Kind of felt like I was cheating!
Some days I have a lot to write about.................... This morning I only had 50 miles to get to Pocatello so we slept in a bit and took our time getting going.  I left around 7:20 and headed south.  Christy met me at 15 and we rode together for 10.  At one point I heard a blood-curdling scream in front of me.  I thought it was just a loud sneeze from Christy.  Then I find out that she had just biked over a snake.  We both started to freak out so we slowed down and decided to go back and see if she killed it. She was telling me it was all coiled up and I had visions of a huge diamond back ready to strike. Well....it was actually a tiny garden snake about 10 inches long...........and, he looked like he had been dead for a while. So, that got the adrenaline going.  We laughed about what we would do if we came upon a snake while we were peeing in the bushes. We were riding through potato country and in one area there were several crop dusters swooping down low over the fields and letting go with huge sprays of pesticides.  It was fascinating to watch them do their work and to see how low to the ground they could get.  We could smell the pesticides in the air. Yucky! We got to Christy's car and she continued on to the next stop.  Several people at the gas station were interested in my ride. A sweet lady sitting in her car noticed my Coasting 2002 logo on my rear pack so she started asking questions. When I told her where I started from she stared at me in disbelief and just looked at me in shock. I gave her my card so I hope she checks the website. It's interesting to see peoples' reactions the further west I get. New York is a long, long way from here.  I started down the road again and pulled over to make a quick phone call to my Mom.  As I was dialing, a car pulled up behind me and a man jumped out carrying a notepad. The first thing he said was, "It's OK, I'm not a weirdo."  I figured he must be from the local paper.  He said he had a few questions for me after I was off the phone.  His name is Winston and he is organizing a 600 mile regional ride from Idaho to Washington and noticed that I was touring so I shared some ideas with him and tried to answer a lot of his questions.  I think his head was spinning after all the things I told him but I was happy that I could help him. We arrived just outside of Pocatello around noon and were met by Russ Speirn-Christy's brother who escorted us to his house. We are staying with Russ and Marilyn for the next two days.  The weather is still unbearably hot so getting in earlier in the day certainly helps. A thank you to my dear friend............ We met in a crowded busy concession stand. Christy's daughter, Sterling and my son, James, were both members of the Boulder High School marching band. We were the dedicated band parents that ran the concession stand as a fundraiser.  I had my head stuck in the popcorn machine when Christy walked in.  She was like a burst of sunshine-all smiley and happy and energetic and before the night was over I felt like I had a found a new friend. We ended the night with our two Doug husbands at the local brewery enjoying a drink together.  That was almost 10 years ago.  We continued with the concession work until our kids graduated and have had a wonderful friendship as a result.  She is the happiest and most positive person in my life.  I never see her down or angry or bitter or mean.  And if I'm down I just have to see her smiling face and things instantly feel better.  We have shared so much.  Eight days with our husbands exploring Rome and Tuscany;  losing track of how many bottles of wine or olives we have eaten.  We've shared gourmet dinners together and sleepovers at their Vail house and our riverside cabin.  We've skiied together, snowshoed hut to hut and soaked in the hot springs at Glenwood Springs.  When the four of us get together hardly an evening goes by without us dreaming or scheming up a new trip. When I told Christy about my crazy bike idea the first thing she said was, "I will do whatever section you want me to do."  And she stuck to her word.  Eight days ago she arrived at the hotel in Rock Springs, Wyoming armed with a car full of cheese, crackers, wine, cold wash cloths, neck weanies, AND, a box of chocolates!  What a friend!  This past week has been a blast. We have hunted for moosies, screamed over snakes and she's listened to my daily cravngs for 'oot beew fwoats!'  I have laughed and enjoyed every minute with her and will miss her terribly.  But, now I have more memories to hang on the wall. Thanks, my dear friend! P.S.  If you want to read a very sweet and funny poem from my hubby, go to the Guestbook on my website.  I think he's in the wrong profession!       
Last night we had a wonderful chicken BBQ prepared by Russ and Marilyn Speirn.  We had a little rain shower just before dinner so it cooled off enough for us to eat outside.  After dinner we took their three dogs, Pilot, Rascal and Hobbs, for a walk-or perhaps they took us for a walk!! I always thought kids were a lot of work!!  You should see these dogs eat ice cubes! I'm so used to getting up early that at 7:00 I had been laying in bed for an hour so I got up and had a great cup of coffee, read the paper and did some computer work. Late morning Christy and I ran some errands and went to the mall.  I got my hair trimmed and bought some new clothes so I can send some of my other stuff back to Boulder with Christy.  We returned in the afternoon and I snuck in a 30 minute nap before leaving at 5:00 with Christy's brother, Russ and his two Yellow Labs, Pilot and Rascal.  He competes with the dogs in field competitions. Tonight was a training night before this weekends' competition.  There were about 6 dogs and they worked on drills having the dogs retrieve fresh killed birds and hidden rubber throws. The dogs had to travel a long distance, swim across rivers, go through brush.  If the dog was off course the owner would blow a whistle, the dog would stop, look at the owner and follow his command or hand gesture. It was very amazing and interesting.  We returned quite late and Marilyn had a nice pasta dinner waiting for us.  Staying in a home is so much nicer than a hotel. Thanks for your hospitality, Russ and Marilyn. Dinner at the Sims' when you come to Boulder!
He almost jumped into my lap!  The cutest little dog, with a large, round black nose.  I had to stop my bike, and, the attached B.O.B. trailer that is now my appendage for the next 4 days. I rode back to the side of the road and there he was, abandoned in the dirt and hot sun.  His new home is on the top of my handlebar bag and his cute ears flap in the wind as the truckers pass.  I immediately named him Nose as that is the first thing I see when I look down. Hopefully he can read maps as he is totally blocking my map so he may have to be relegated to a rear pack. Sad, my friend abandons me and I have to talk to a stuffed dog!!  CHRISTY!!! WHERE ARE YOU???? I thought I would be on my own all day today but Christy decided to spend another night at her brothers house so we both left Pocatello at 6A.M. and we drove back to Blackfoot where my turnoff was to head towards the Sawtooth Mountains. I rode for 20 miles and Christy 10 more with me and then she went ahead again and did another 7. By then we were close to the National Historical Monument for the first Nuclear Power plant in the USA so we diverted off the main road and toured the facility.  Pretty scary stuff. This area is littered with radioactive material, buried in huge containers. I think I'm glowing!! Well, another goodbye to another great sagger.  I have been so blessed and have had so much fun! I continued on with B.O.B. and now, the latest buddy, Nose! My hotel in in Arco, ID tonight. Their claim to fame is that Arco was the first USA city to be powered by atomic energy.  I'm getting a full nights sleep-tomorrow is a 73 mile day-with B.O.B.!!     
Sun comin' up over New York City, School bus driver in a traffic jam. Lookin' at the faces in her rearview mirror. Lookin' at the promise of the promised land. One kid dreams of fame and fortune. One kid helps pay the rent. One could end up goin' to prison. One just might be president. ONLY IN AMERICA, where we're dreamin' in Red, White and Blue. ONLY IN AMERICA, where we dream as big as we want to. We all get a chance, everybody gets to dance, ONLY IN AMERICA! Sun goin' down on an LA freeway. Newlyweds in the back of a limousine. A welders son and a bankers daughter. All they want is everything. She came out here to be an actress. He was a singer in a band. They just might go back to Oklahoma, and talk about the stars they could have been. ONLY IN AMERICA, where we're dreamin' in Red, White and Blue. ONLY IN AMERICA, where we dream as big as we want to. We all get a chance, everybody gets to dance, ONLY IN AMERICA! Song and lyrics by Brooks and Dunn Yesterday afternoon as I was looking for my hotel in Arco, ID (Population of 1,200) I rode past "Grandpa's Southern BBQ."  I returned later for dinner.  The menu boasted all the yummy southern BBQ foods-ribs, chicken, cole slaw, beans, collard greens, corn bread and sweet potato pie!  Lloyd is a 30 something black man who owns Grandpa's. I was amazed that he and his wife made sure that they stopped to visit with every person having dinner at their restaurant. Lloyd shook everyone's hand, and made sure he knew their name.  His restaurant is so successful that he is opening a second one in Idaho Falls and hopefully in Boise.  The Boise newspaper did an article on Grandpa's and they were lined up out the door. My dinner was excellent, topped off with fresh peach cobbler.   I listened to the song "Only in America" this morning while riding and thought of Lloyd. This song has meant a lot to me personally during this ride. I feel so blessed that I have seen so much of this world and that this dream of mine is no longer a dream.  I got a chance, and I got to DANCE! Today was another beautiful day. Cloudy most of the day so a nice break from the heat.  I left at 6 A.M. and was in Hailey by 2:00.  The Sawtooths are beckoning and I begin my ascent tomorrow.     
A whopping 12 miles today-I feel a little embarrassed!  But hey, no one said this had to be all work and no play, right?  So, after feeling guilty for about 2 whole minutes and finally getting out of bed at 7:30 I got me gear together and got on the bike path right next to my hotel.  The path goes from Hailey to Ketchum and was such a nice break from the heavy travelled road.  I stopped on the path and had my banana, bagel and juice, with beautiful views all around.  Shortly after I met up with a very nice couple, Scott and Mary Alice.  (Hey you two, if you get around to reading this please go to Guestbook at the top of this page and send me you email address, OK?)   They were both on recumbents and were into their 50th month of travel and fun.  Yes, 50th month!  They have no home and live in their van/camper and travel all over and then spend three winter months in Mexico.  They are 50ish, retired, and having a blast. They hike, bike, swim and just play.  It was fun talking to them and wondering what life would be like to just play every day.  I arrived at the Kentwood Lodge at 10:00 and was lucky to get into my room right away.  Shortly after I took my bike to a local bike shop to get my handlebar tape replaced. Then I went to the library to do some work on the internet. I had a nice lunch at a sidewalk cafe and spent the afternoon shopping-just a few new things to add to my bag!  Ketchum reminds me of Boulder but the population here is only about 3,000.  The town is surrounded by mountains-what a neat place.
Actually, I don't think one can ever overdo being outdoors, especially on a day like today.  I awoke at 5:45 to the sound of cars driving in rain. By the time I left the hotel the rain had stopped and I could tell it was going to be one of those incredibly beautiful summer mountain days.  It had cooled off to the mid 40's so I got a cup of coffee, some juice and toast and was on my way.  The same bike path I took into Ketchum continued north of town for another 5 or so miles.  Then the road followed the river on an ever so gentle incline. I meandered along, enjoying the beautiful Sun Valley homes, the horses and the mountains. The mountain air is indescribable. The smells are so sweet and as I ride I feel the changes in air; one second warm and musty, the next cool and clean. I want to gulp it all in and hope that I can remember the feeling when I return home.  At about 15 miles I began the climb up Galena Pass, which summitted at 8,450 feet.  At the top I was treated to spectacular views of the valley floor below and a 5 mile, 7 percent downhill grade. Then the road was very flat with the Sawtooth Mountains looming overhead to my left. I think the Grand Tetons and the Sawtooths are some of the most beautiful mountains in the world.  Around noon my friend, Betty Frazier from Boise caught up with me.  Traveling with her are her two grandaughters, Sara and Katie who are on summer holiday with Betty and Allen for a month.  They live in Wichita.  Betty stopped in Ketchum this morning to retrieve my B.O.B. trailer and duffle bag which made my climb a lot more fun! At around 1:00 we met in Stanley, racked my bike and drove 9 miles to Stanley Lake for a picnic lunch.  The girls swam in the lake and then we drove back to Stanley to enjoy the Mountain Mama's Art and Craft Fair.  After our fill of snowcones and  kettle corn we drove 21 miles to Clayton where our cabins are for the night. We ate dinner in the restaurant and then enjoyed sitting outside and studying the maps.     
Every night my husband and I talk on the phone and he asks me how my day was and each day I tell him, "I had a great day!"  I'm sure you are all getting tired of all the good news and good times I'm having.  And, where are all the horror stories of flat tires, rain storms, snow, sleet, hail.............????  I cannot begin to tell you what an experience I am having.  When I think of coming home and answering all the questions of, 'how was it?' I get very emotional and at a loss for words.  And I still have over a month left to go!  I feel so pwerful and so healthy-the best I have ever, ever felt. The first 13 years of my life I was raised on the farm and played hard but also worked hard. That is why I love the outdoors so much but imagine having three and a half months of playing every single day-as an adult!  This is a dream that is a thousand times better than I could have ever wished for.  I have been with wonderful family and friends and met so many awesome strangers.  But, I will quit for now because this isn't even my swan song.  Besides, I am sitting here with two very cute, energetic girls who are roasting marshmallows at the campfire and my smores is getting cold.  Night, night!       
The mornings in the Idaho mountains are very, very chilly. We left our cozy, warm cabins and Betty and the girls drove me to my drop off spot from yesterday. I was on the road around 7:30.  I rode along the Payette River for a good part of the morning, mostly downhill or a few gentle uphills.  At Horseshoe Bend I saw what Betty had warned me about - the road snaking up and up the mountain!  I pulled over and put some disco music on for inspiration and with the help of granny gear I made it up and over another pass.  I think they're getting a little easier-my god, by now they better be!  At the top I had a wonderful 14 mile downhill to Eagle.  A few turns and I was at Betty and Allen's beautiful home.  A cold beer, a long shower and now for a few days of just goofing off!   
After breakfast Allen and I drove to the Caldwell Airport and pulled his Beechcraft Baron out of the hangar.  The Baron is a twin engine, pressurized, 6 seater airplane. It had been years since I had flown in a small plane so I was pretty excited and just a little nervous.  I don't like bumps on the huge jetliners and I knew this could be even more exciting so I warned Allen that I might scream if things got a little rocky. I also asked him where the sick bags were,  just in case, and he handed me four bags! So, after all the preflight checks and instructions we were off.  It was very smooth for the first 15 minutes but then we hit some bumps but I was really enjoying the scenery out of the window and wasn't feeling a bit nervous or sick.  It was fascinating to be in the co-pilots seat and watch all the action up close and personal and Allen did a great job explaining all the different controls.  The only time I got a little sweaty was when he put the autopilot on.  It was very eery watching the plane just fly itself-especially when it turned!  We flew over a part of Oregon, Nevada and then Utah.  We climbed to 15,500 feet and had a huge bank of smoke from the forest fires in the region.  We landed in Cedar City, Utah; very close to the Arizona border-about 500 miles from Boise. Allen said he had to deliver something to a guy so he had them put fuel in the plane and then we went in to pay the bill and wait for his friend to arrive.  We went around the corner of the lounge to get a soda from the machine and then stepped back into the lounge. There were some steps off to the side and I saw a guy coming down.  I saw his feet, his shorts and  then his shirt.  I said to myself, 'Wow, my husband has the exact same shirt.' Within 2 seconds I saw the head connected to the shirt and realized IT WAS my husband!  A very well planned out surprise!  I had told Doug several times that he should meet me in Boise and spend a few days at Allen and Betty's house.  He kept telling me that he had to finish school and get back to Boulder to start his new business.  Well, he did finish school and planned the whole surprise out with Allen and Betty.  So, we had another passenger on the flight back and we now have 2 days of fun in Boise before he heads back to Boulder and I continue my journey west.  What fun! We ended the day with a delicious Italian dinner and caught up with old friends until midnight.     
Doug and I decided to take an extra day off so I'm not riding until Friday and Allen will fly Doug back down to Cedar City so he can get his car and finish his road trip to Boulder.  Today was quite a lazy day.  We did some computer work in the morning and then the guys went off to have lunch with some HP guys from the past. Betty and I did some shopping/browsing in Boise, went to the Boise Art Museum and then we all had a summer BBQ dinner with Wayne and Phyllis Bradburn, Brock and Kelly Frazier and Sara and Katie.  Don't you just love it when you get together with friends that you have not seen for a long time and you just continue where you left off years ago?  The only thing that seems to have changed is that somehow all of our kids have grown up, gotten older, gotten married, had babies..... but, we haven't changed a bit!  We laughed all night long!  Friday July 25, 2002  This morning the guys are off for a game of golf and the girls will hit the mall. This is my last chance to send things home to Boulder!    Word is that this afternoon the brave ones will get in tubes and float down the cold Boise River.  Well, crazy and brave is more like it.  We packed up the car with blow up rafts, towels, and kids.  One car was dropped off at the end and then we all drove upriver.  They are very serious about their rafting here.  At the park there are stations, very much like a gas station, where you belly up with your raft and blow them up with air.  We had four rafts and three inner tubes amongst us.  About the time we started to raft an incredible wind kicked up and even though we were floating downriver, the wind was actually pushing us back. We crossed about four diversion dams and Doug and I managed to get completely soaked at the first two.  Our raft was also losing air so by the time we finished we were sitting in about two feet of water. BBBRRRRRR!  A rainstorm hit shortly after we got out of the water.  I actually took a hot bath when we got back home.  Great pizza and a glass of red wine topped off a very fun day!  Thanks again to Allen and Betty for all of your generosity and friendship!  Good memories!     
I kissed my husband goodbye at 8:30 as he was leaving with Allen to head to the Caldwell Airport for his chauffered flight back to Cedar City to get his car.  I've had three cushy, lazy days off but it felt good to be back on the bike.  The sights and smells today were wonderful.  I passed twelve foot high corn in the fields and aromatic mint fields that made me breath so hard I thought I was hyperventilating!  I also went by onion, sugar beet and green bean fields.  I had to resist the urge to stop at the small farmer's market stands as I had no room in my packs.  OK Allen, you jinxed me.  You mentioned that I stopped keeping track of flat tires (because I haven't had any!) but guess what?  I had a flat tire today, my first front flat.  Much easier to change though.  I had been getting out of practice plus I love the looks I get from people when I put my purple gloves on!  I finished my ride around 2:30 and treated myself to a 'woot beew fwoat at A&W. There is nothing better than cold root beer and ice cold ice cream, yum!  When Doug left this morning he took B.O.B. back with him. (My trailer)  Wow, what a treat.  That means that I will have someone supporting me the rest of the ride.  I left my duffle bag behind in Eagle and my parents are swinging by to get it on their way to the RV Park tonight.  Yes, THEY'RE BAAAACCCKKK!  for another round of sagging!  The plan is for them to be with me until we reach the coast.  So, I had another great day and the adventure continues.  And yes, Mark, your Mother will be in Oregon tomorrow, OK? F.T.C. Gladys 10 
OK, the debut of the poem I have been working on for two months! Oh the west winds they do blow. I know this because you've all told me so. I spun in granny gear all day long, because the winds were oh so strong. My minds been in a vortex haze, as I've remembered calmer days. My music has tried to soothe my soul, as I try to complete another days goal. My teeth are full of bugs and sand, from this great and wonderful Oregonland. So, wish as I may and wish as I might, you know I'll be prayin' for calmer winds tonight! I don't think I need to say a whole lot more about today other than if I would have more days like this I think I'd be back in Boulder by now.  I don't know what happened today but I struggled through every mile.  I was very tired and just could not get my energy level up to fight the winds. We are in Eastern Oregon and there are large distances between any campgrounds so we had planned on going back to last nights spot.  I anticipated having in about 60 miles by 12:30 and my parents passed me at 11:30 with only 38 miles.  My Mom opened her window and I said, "OK, I've had enough fun for the day."  So I bailed early and am hoping that tomorrow will be better.   
I slept very well last night and was rarin' to go this morning. However, shortly after I left the winds were back.  But I felt much better today and was enjoying myself in spite of the wind.  The terrain was high desert, similar to areas of Kansas, Colorado, Utah and Wyoming.  I had two passes to climb and slowly began seeing prettier scenery and more trees.  Mom and Dad had a spot at the Unity Lake State Park campground.  Just outside of Unity is a Fire Camp where 1,200 hot shots and firefighters are camping to help with the 16 fires burning in Oregon.  It is a virtual city with tents all around and shower and cooking facilities  to handle all the crews.  We went into town for dinner and noticed a pick up truck with firefighters loading up all the bagged ice from the local gas station.  I'm sure the winds are causing all kinds of problems.     
The wind continues to blow like crazy, yes, from the west but there is not a whole lot I can do about it.  Except complain, but life is too short to do a lot of that.  So, off I went this morning.  First pass was a moderate grade 12 mile climb and then I was into the beautiful Malheur National Forest. A second climb took me to 5,200 feet followed by a nice downhill into the valley.  As I turned the bend I saw one of the forest fires quite close to where I was.  All day long I was being passed by hotshot crews heading to one of the fires.  A coyote crossed in front of me today. He was pretty close to me so as I started reaching for my pepper spray he noticed me and immediately bolted into the woods. He was pretty mangy and scraggly.  I was also passed or being met by 11 logging trucks. I'm going to try and keep a log each day to see how many pass me.  Amazing what games one comes up with when the days are long and hot.  Todays game was I had to have so many cars pass me before I could look at my odometer.  That was when the heat and wind were at their worst and I was getting tired.  A fun story to share-my Dad was chatting with someone at a general store in Unity yesterday.  He told the story of an 80 year old biker that was on a cross country tour. When he got to the midwest he had a heart attack.  After he recovered he wanted to continue the ride so his daughter and son-in-law (who were probably in their 50's or 60's) agreed to follow him in their van.  When the biker encountered a large hill the kids would rack the bike and give him a ride to the top.  He would then bike DOWN the hill, get picked up again and dropped off at the top to continue on.  What determination.  I want to be like him when I grow up!  Speaking of down the hill.  I love bike touring where I have never biked before.  What keeps me going is the curiosity of what is over the hill or around the bend.  I especially like it when I have a nice downhill! Tonight we are at the Clyde Holliday State Park outside of Mount Vernon.  We have a nice shady spot by the river and Mom's dinner smells pretty good!     
I had to laugh this morning. During the first 10 miles I passed so many farms.  There were cows, goats, horses, ducks, roosters and chickens.  The locals here must truly love their animals-see the photo below. The first 35 miles were mostly flat or downhill so I averaged 14.5 miles an hour.  I met Mom and Dad at the John Day Fossil Bed Visitor Center around 10:00.  The fossil beds cover 14,000 acres and preserve a 40 million year record of plant and animal life. The rock formations in the area were very beautiful. I have never been to central Oregon so I didn't know what to expect. I met some riders with the same Adventure Cycling group that I met in Colorado. They went through Yellowstone and up to Montana while I did the Sawtooths and by coincidence I met the same group in the middle of Oregon. The 32 miles in the afternoon were horrible.  The winds kicked up, I had a pass to climb and the heat was unbearable.  I am exhausted. Our facililties are a little primitive tonight.  But we do have electrical hookup for A/C.  Right next door is a local business that makes furniture from twisted juniper.  The trees get twisted from lack of water and constant sun and excess heat.  The trees are usually found on only south facing slopes. A king size bed frame is $5,000 and we would have to enlarge the bedroom at the cabin for the bed to fit!

I was questioned quite frequently regarding my choice of an East to West coast ride.  There were times when I was second guessing my choice but after today I know that I made the right one.  I left Bend and had an easy 22 miles to the very tiny but very cute town of Sisters, OR.  The town had so many neat shops and restaurants but at 8:30 most were still closed so my wallet didn't lose any money! Immediately out of Sisters I saw all the caution signs warning any motorists that if they were pulling anything longer than 35 feet they better turn around.  I knew that I had a 12 mile climb to 5,300 feet so I settled into my slow and steady pace.  I kept waiting for the hills.  I was climbing but it was very manageable.  Within an hour I saw the summit sign and realized that I was reading the Adventure Cycling description written from a western approach to the summit! At the top of McKenzie Pass I had beautiful views of several mountain peaks and lava fields all around.  Not much grows in the lava so it looked like the moon.  It was pretty cold at the top so I added some layers and started down the 22 mile descent through some of the most spectacular forest I have ever seen.  The trees were thick on both sides of the winding road and the forest floor was lush with green ferns.  The traffic was very light because cars and RV's are encouraged to take the Santiam Pass alternate route so it was very quiet and peaceful. I wanted to stay there all day!  When the two roads joined up I thought I might run into Mom and Dad but I bet my Mom is shopping up a storm in Sisters so I found our destination for the night and am relaxing at the Belknap Hot Springs Resort and Campground until they arrive. I started getting concerned when they didn't arrive by 6:30 so I called 911 and the operator told me to call the Oregon Highway Patrol. They told me that a semi truck had jackknifed on the road that Mom and Dad had to take over the pass.  He said there were no motorhomes involved in the accident so I was relieved.  When they finally arrived at 7:30 they told me they were not in the traffic jam. They stayed behind in Sisters to go to church and their phone messages on my cell did not go through! So, only two more days before I see the Pacific Ocean, I'm getting excited!     
OK, this is the second attempt at today's journal. I hit the wrong button and deleted the first one.  Duh!  Oh well, I really didn't like it anyway. I had a very nice ride today, pushed myself a little so I could work off all this good food that Mom has been preparing.  The weather has finally cooled down. It is in the 70's during the day which is just perfect for riding.  Mom and Dad met me on the outskirts of Eugene as I cannot ride on the interstate-legally, anyway.  We found our RV park and after I showered we drove to Springfield to attend the filbert festival. We were expecting to see filberts in every conceivable concoction but all we found were roasted, sweet filberts.  They had a great country western band that was clashing with the Scotish bagpipers.  It is funny to see all the local festivals across the country.  They all have kettle corn, slushies and the local brews along with the crafts of the region, which are also pretty similar.  Neclaces, painted gourdes, lotions made from local stuff, hand stitchery and the local chiropractor wanting to check your spine.  How fun! Tonight after dinner we went to visit with my Dad's second cousins which was very enjoyable.  Like I said yesterday, retired people just love to sit and talk and they always have the greatest stories to tell.   
When my oldest son, Mike was a teenager he lived with his father in Minneapolis.  He would come for visits when Doug and I lived in Laguna Niguel, CA. Our home was about 5 miles from the beach.  The minute he would jump out of the car when we got home he would say, "Wow, Mom, I can smell the ocean from here."  Well Mike, today I smelled the ocean too and I thought of you when you were a young man.  It is a wonderful smell!  At 3,888 miles I have biked across this wonderful country of ours and by 5:30 Grandma and Grandpa and I were walking on the beach, watching the fog roll in. Then we went to town and celebrated with martinis and the freshest dungeness crab I have ever had.   Today was another spectacular, very memorable day.  One of those top 10 days that I will always remember.  I left Eugene this morning and found a bike path very similar to the one we have along the river in Boulder.  I stopped to talk to a very sweet couple who helped me with directions and soon I was on the outskirts of town.  I stopped at a scooter shop and they happened to have the exact scooter that my daughter Jen and her Daddy just bought before she goes back to CSU.  On the west side of town I noticed that there were huge bushes of fresh, ripe blackberries off the side of road.  I came to a screeching stop and stood in awe at what was before me.  As luck would have it there was a clean plastic bag under one of the bushes so I spent 30 minutes gathering a surprise for my Mom who loves blackberries.  About two hours later Mom and Dad pulled over and I surprised Mom with my morning pickin's.  We had lunch together and waited out a nice rain shower.  I left again with about 35 more miles to go. The area between Eugene and Florence is National Forest, fairly hilly and very beautiful.  I rode through another rainstorm and then along the North Fork Siuslaw River into Florence.  I met Mom and Dad at our meeting spot and cried and laughed at the wonderful feeling I had inside of me!  Here I was, at the Pacific Coast!  This simple farm girl-I BIKED ACROSS THE USA!!  I BIKED ACROSS THE USA!  Unbelievable!  We drove a few miles to the coast and walked on the beach.  The fog was beginning to roll in-it was so beautiful. Then we drove into town and found the best seafood restaurant in town and celebrated with martinis and the best, freshest dungeness crab in the world!   LIFE IS GOOD!  But wait, this ride is still 800 miles short of my goal so not too much celebrating girl!  But, I will take two days off and drive up the coast with Mom and Dad where they will kick me out of the nest (again) in Astoria where I will begin the last leg of this awesome journey.     
August 6, 2002 My parents are leaving soon so we decided to take two days off and just play and sight see.  We left Florence the morning of the 6th (after sleeping in until 7:30!) and stopped for a coffee and scone in town and then headed up the coast.  The Oregon coast is spectacular.  One beautiful scene after another. A light fog hovered over the beach.  We took our time; stopped at the beach for a walk in the sand and a lunch stop. We stopped in Lincoln City and booked a hotel room for Friday where my cousin Margaret and her husband will meet me and I also dropped off my duffle bag.  When we arrived in Tilamook we toured the Tilamook Cheese Factory where they store 50 million pounds of cheese a year!  We also toured Blue Heron Cheese Factory where we sampled some very good Brie cheeses as well as Oregon wines.  There is an Air Museum here that my Dad wants to tour so we found an RV park south of town and will do the tour in the morning. August 7, 2002 Happy Birthday to my sweet husband, Doug.  I feel so bad that I am not at home to celebrate with him but I know that Jennifer will make the day special for her Dad. We toured the Air Museum this morning.  It was one of those museums with wonderful displays of war memorabilia and touching family stories where you could spend days reading everything.  In the afternoon we headed north and crossed a spectacular bridge between Astoria, OR and the state of Washington.  We went back to Astoria and walked along the riverfront.  In its' heyday, Astoria was the salmon canning capitol of the world with over 40 canneries. We had some excellent fish and chips at the Buoy 9 restaurant in Hammond and then spent the night at the Fort Stevens State Park.   
Well, I got the boot today!  I spent my last night in my bed and breakfast on wheels.  Time for Mom and Dad to start heading back home and for me to head south to meet up with my cousin.  We had a very tearful goodbye this morning.  Mom and Dad sagged me for three whole weeks during the course of this ride and we had a very special time together.  We had some very quality time to sit and visit, to sight see, to go to church together, to chat, to visit with family in Iowa and Eugene, OR,  to share some wonderful meals together and to do a lot of laughing. Memories that no one can ever take away from me.  Thanks from the bottom of my heart, Mom and Dad. You are simply the best! I spent a leisurely day heading down the coast, stopping often to stare in awe at the most beautiful coastal scenery I have every seen. I sat on the beach for a muffin and banana break and should have taken my shoes off and gone for a walk. The weather was a perfect low 70's, with no wind until the afternoon. I talked to a bike tourist who left Boston 8 days before I left New York and today our paths crossed with him heading to Astoria where he will go home and I'm heading south. He was refreshed and like me, not eager for his ride to end.  I also talked to an older gentleman who had been traveling in his RV for the past year and a half and when I told him I was celebrating my 50th this fall he said he was guessing that I was about 32!  Sweet!     
I left my hotel at 7:30 and was back in Tilamook around 9:00.  I picked up some cheese and Margaret and I talked on our cell phones about our meeting plans for later in the day.  I followed Adventure Cycling's maps and instead of following 101 South I decided to take the Three Coves Scenic Route closer to the coast. Well, it was certainly beautiful and scenic but also a lot more windy and hilly.  I rode through patches of fog and dense forests.  I had a huge climb before Cape Lookout and as I started downhill I was met by Ron, Margaret and Ryan.  I kidded Margaret that she must have planned meeting me at the top of the climb and that she was cheating going down the pass but not up. We had more ups and downs and another huge climb before descending into Lincoln City where Ron and Ryan were waiting for us.  We had a very delicious dinner at Kyllo's across from the Lincoln City Inn.  I'm tired today-that's what I get for taking two days off the bike! But hey, I should be-my odometer now reads over 4,000 miles Yeah hooh!     
It feels weird heading south each day. I still cannot believe that I am on the west coast.  It's great having the prevailing winds coming from the north and the west.  By the afternoon the north winds were so strong that we were actually boosted along as we were going uphill!  What a blast that is!  But I got my butt beat today by trying to keep up with Margaret-she is an amazingly strong rider, makes it look effortless, hardly sweats and makes me work my A_ _ off trying to keep up with her.  We haven't seen each other in a year and have a lot of catching up to do so when the shoulder is wide enough we like to ride side by side so we can solve all the world's problems. Anyway, we left the hotel in Lincoln City by 8am and were at the Oregon Coast Aquarium in Newport around 11:00.  We spent a few hours there and then stopped at a 50's diner for lunch.  That sort of stop does it for me and it always takes me a while to get back in the groove.  Today's ride was very hilly and at one point as I'm going up a hill-with Margaret in front of me-I hear a guy in the deep woods, coughing.  I looked down into the mountain and see a guy standing there, stark naked!  I didn't know what else to do so I said, "Hi."  He was so shocked to see me that he instinctively hunched over and covered his privates!  I laughed all the way up the hill and was mad at myself that I didn't stop and say, 'can I help you?'  That would have been a more interesting web story!   Ron and Ryan went up ahead to Yachats to look for a hotel and everything was full so they drove up ahead to Florence, got a room and came back to get us. Tomorrow they'll have to drive us back to the drop off point. My parents are still in the area so we are all having dinner together tonight.     
We got a late start today.  We had breakfast with my parents and said goodbye (again) around 9am.  By the time Ron drove us to our drop off spot north of Yachats and we were ready to roll it was around 10:00.  We stopped at the Seal Caves for a potty stop and then kept rolling at a fast pace.  Today a large portion of the Oregon coast was the Oregon Dunes National Recreation Area where huge sand dunes form close to the ocean and it is a huge recreation area for dune buggies.   We stopped in Reedsport for lunch at a Subway and while we were there we met the cutest young couple from Germany.  They were teachers and were bike touring from Seattle to San Francisco-with their 2 year old daughter in a Burley trailer! They were camping each night and sounded like they were having a great time. They only rode 40 miles a day so they had plenty of time to enjoy the sights. They fly home from San Francisco on September 5th and start back to teaching on the 7th!   Margaret came out after lunch and realized she had a flat so we changed that first and then we left for Reedsport and headed to North Bend/Coos Bay.  Ron called to say that we had a hotel in Coos Bay but to be careful on the bridge.  The wind was progressively getting stronger in the afternoon. The bridge over Coos Bay is very large and as we approached closer to the bridge we decided to ride across on the pedestrian walkway that was elevated about a foot off of the roadway and was only about 2 feet wide.  We seemed to be doing OK on the approach but as soon as we were on the bridge itself the wind was just brutal.  Margaret was ahead of me and we were both struggling with the wind. I stopped briefly to check things out and as I started getting back on my bike the wind kicked me into the metal railing. My knuckles on my right hand got bruised and that is when I decided to walk to bike.  Margaret decided to do the same.  I have never been in such a strong wind.  I could have left the bike go and the wind would have just carried it off!  We finally made it across and I think my shoulders were glued to my ears!  Very scary! 
A lazy, slow day today.  We slept in, had coffee and left around noon, heading to Bandon to the home of Pat and Fred Richert.  Pat is the sister of Ron Carfi, who is my cousin Margaret's husband.  We arrived in Bandon around 2:00 and had a late lunch and did some shopping before going out to Pat and Fred's house.  They farm 13 acres of cranberries for Ocean Spray so I learned a little about cranberries.  They are grown quite conventionally in what looks like a sunken field.  At harvest time the berries are beat with a machine to loosen them from the vine and then the fields are flooded so the berries float to the top and then they use boomsticks to round up the berries and elevate them into a truck. Another method is to dry pick the cranberries with a different kind of machine.  In Orgeon about 3,000 acres are dedicated to cranberry farming.  Bandon used to be well known for its'logging and fishing but is now more of a tourist area where the Bandon Dunes Golf Course is number two in the country behind Pebble Beach.   Pat prepared a wonderful dinner of fresh summer salad, bread and lasagna, fresh berries and ice cream.  Another wonderful night in a home rather than a hotel room.  Thank you Pat and Fred!       
We said our goodbyes at Patti's house and Ron drove us to the end of their dirt road.  After 5 miles we stopped at Misty Meadows-a shop that sold local jams, jellies, soup mixes and such so we picked up a few items and then hit the road.  A few miles later Margaret had another flat so we took our time and leisurely changed the tire, with me supervising and Margaret doing most of the work.  I never knew that I would become such a pro at changing flats!   At Port Orford we got a sandwich to go at a small restaurant and then stopped later for lunch. Ron and Ryan met up with us so we unloaded some of our goodies into the truck, picked a few wild blackberries and continued on to Gold Beach. The weather today was very unusual. We started out with sunny skies but by late morning it all changed to very foggy and cool temps. You know how introspective one gets when it's a cold, foggy, rainy kind of day?  I felt very blue all day. First of all it was my wedding anniversary and I wasn't with my husband. Secondly, I realized that tomorrow I will cross over the California border and I know that I need to start preparing myself for the end. Each time I tried to put into mental words how I feel about this whole experience I would get too emotional. I plan on spending a few solitary days close to a beach so I can put my final thoughts into coherent words. We dressed warmly and went to dinner and when we returned we noticed how smoky the air smelled.  We have been told that the smoke from the fire south and west of here is very dangerous and we are not sure if we will be able to ride through it so we will survey the situation tomorrow morning.  So far the Florence/Brookings fire has burned over 330,000 acres and is no where close to being contained.   P.S. Happy 19th Anniversary to my hubby!!     
The weather continues to feel like my spirit but I'm trying to take advantage of it and start working on my final thoughts. I even had to pull over once today to jot some thoughts down on paper.  We left Gold Beach at 9:30 to a very, very heavy fog-almost misty out.  I skipped my vitamins and breakfast. As you will see, I paid for it later in the day.  Anyway, after a cup of coffee and a banana we were on our way.  At about 15 miles we met up with a bike tourist that we met briefly yesterday.  To protect the innocent I will not go into details about him but within moments of meeting him yesterday both Margaret and I thought he was a little strange.  Well, as luck would have it, we met up with him again today when the traffic was stopped for road construction and he pulled up right behind us.  His greeting to us was, 'well hello ladies.'  We tried to avoid him but he stuck to us like glue.  After a mile I told Margaret we should stop and call Ron on the cell. Well, he stopped also!  By mile 25 we were entering Brookings and we knew that we were stopping at Ron's sisters restaurant but we didn't want 'tagalong' to follow us. As we worked the uphills into Brookings we worked our asses off trying to ditch this guy but he always seemed to catch up with us on the downhills.  Our  knowledgeable sagger Ron informed us a few days ago that we will soon pass through an elk reserve and that the elk can run up to 35 miles an hour so we thought that this would be a perfect opportunity to train for running from the elk!  At a stop sign he asked where we were headed so I told him we had family in Brookings and that we might spend the day and night.  When we got to Jeanette and Mels restaurant we saw him passing by.  He was also headed to Crescent City like we were but we got to the hotel without running into him again.  Anyway, back to my weird body.  I decided that I could skip a nutritious meal this morning and had a cup of coffee and a banana.  Within a few hours I had some dried fruit and then in Brookings I had a bowl of soup, some toast and another cup of coffee. Sounds OK for a sedentary person but by 3:00 I was low on energy so I had an orange. That lasted for about 30 minutes and I totally BONKED. I had absolutely no energy and I knew that we had less than 6 miles to go but Margaret suggested I eat a Cliff Bar which luckily kicked in and got me to the bike shop for a quick repair and then to the hotel for cheese and crackers.  It is amazing how much energy my body requires for hour after hour of pedaling.  Luckily my body tells me when it is running low on fuel and what it needs to keep going but it is kind of scary to feel so empty.  I now know what they mean when they say you've 'hit the wall,' or 'bonked.'   The fires seem to be far enough east of us that we are not affected by the smoke.  It is strange for it to be so cold and foggy here but the weather channel says cit is in the 100's further inland. Good thing Ron and Margaret have a pool at their home in Ukiah so I can work on this lovely biker tan of mine.     

A day spent in Ukiah with my cousins and Aunt.  Margaret and I left her house on our bikes around 9 this morning and did a few errands in town and then we headed out to the Fetzer Winery. The road wound through the beautiful countryside with vineyards and pear orchards all around.  The pears are being picked right now and we were passed by farmers pulling trailers with huge crates that were overflowing with pears. The grapes will soon be ready for the crush and the vines are heavy with purple and green grapes.  I picked a small cluster of  purple grapes and was amazed at how sweet they were.  Margaret didn't want me to lose my strength on the bike so she put me to work at a very serious pace around the curves. This woman is amazing, I'd like to bottle some of her energy and sell it.  She goes in high gear all day, both on the bike and off and at night time her head hits the pillow and she is out!  No wonder!  She would be a great personal trainer!  Anyway, Ron and my Aunt Marion met us out at Fetzer for lunch.  Each time we travel to Ukiah we make a visit to the winery.  I think it is one of the most beautiful ones, not to dismiss that their wine is some of the best in the world. The grounds are beautiful and they have a Bed and Breakfast there also. The tasting room is abuzz with tour groups and the gift shop and deli are stocked with all kinds of items one must have. I always leave with a bag full of goodies.  The tasting room manager's name is Pat.  She is a bubbly, funny gal who is always there to help with the wine selections and makes sure that we have a little more than a tastes' portion in our glasses. We returned to Margarets for a dip in the pool and then enjoyed a family dinner at my aunt's house to celebrate cousin Sue's birthday. Speaking of birthdays, my son Mike and his wife share the same birthday today.  Happy Birthday to both of you with love from your wandering mother!     
Sunday August 18, 2002 Yesterday my Aunt Marion and I left Ukiah at 4PM and drove to the drop off point where Margaret and I left off on the 15th. We stopped in Eureka and arrived at the Trees Motel around 10::00. Monday August 19, 2002 I felt like Superwoman today. I effortlessly pedal up the hills like I have been doing this my whole life.  Amazing what three months in the saddle will do.  I kept chuckling today thinking back to a year ago-I sent a letter to family and friends announcing my crazy idea.  At Christmas I got a card from an acquaintance whose husband biked the Pacific Coast a few years ago. He told his wife to tell me that I was nuts!  All I could think today was, 'if you could see me now.' (I also thought - 'eat my dust.'!! ) I left Klamath and within 5 miles I took a scenic 10 mile drive through the Prairie Creek Redwoods State Park which runs parallel to Hwy 101 but with much less traffic. It was a magnificent ride. I wanted to bottle the sights and smells-I could have made a fortune!  I met my Aunt in Trinadad and I had a sandwich for lunch. I only had about 15 more miles to go and I arrived at our hotel in Arcata around 2:30.  After showering we drove into Eureka where we shopped and browsed. We went to the Samoa Cookhouse for dinner. This cookhouse has been serving food continuously for 105 years but they only began serving the public in the 60's. Prior to that it was a cookhouse for the local loggers. The food is served family style with hearty portions of fried chicken, pork, potatoes, corn, soup, salad and peach pie.   
OK Patti, I found another gem for you to explore on your next visit to California!  Patti is a teacher friend of mine and last week she sent me an email telling me how wonderful Bandon by the Sea in Oregon is.  The day I got her email is the day I spent in Bandon. A few days ago another email telling me to check out Trinidad and ironically I stopped there and got the email that night!  She also mentioned Mendocino where I will be next week. So Patti, if you haven't been to Ferndale you need to go.  Ferndale is a small town 25 miles south of Eureka.  It has beautiful "Painted Ladies."  A term used for lovingly restored Victorian homes.  Lots of tiny shops and even a Rexall Drugstore.  We spent a few hours there this morning.  One of the stores had wooden floors and all the old creams, soaps, salves, candies and goodies from earlier days.   After lunch I got back on the bike-yes, I am still biking in case it sounds like I'm doing too much other fun stuff!  At the 40 mile mark I took the exit to Avenue of the Giants.  It is a 32 mile stretch of road, off of Hwy 101 that goes through beautiful redwood groves.  After about 5 miles I noticed my Aunt pulled over by a vegetable stand.  The owner was selling homemade blackberry popsicles, made with fresh berries, sugar and water.  A tourist that stopped for the same thing was nice enough to buy mine-my Aunt couldn't wait for me and had already eaten hers!  They were delicious.  We bought some local tomatoes and headed down the road only to be stopped by blackberry bushes heavy with fruit.  My Aunt had an empty container in her car and within 20 minutes we had picked a quart of sweet berries.   Now we are relaxing at the Redcrest Lodge.  Comfy, cozy cabins with porches that just beg you to sit on them and read-so we did!   
I will pass on the comentary for today and just let you enjoy some of the sights I was so fortunate to experience.  I walked in the woods today with the gigantic redwoods all around me and with tears in my eyes I marveled at their awesome beauty and felt so blessed to be standing there in their presence. "The redwoods once seen, leave a mark or create a vision that stays with you always.....from them comes silence and awe.  The most irreverent of men, in the presence of redwoods, goes under a spell of wonder and respect"   John Steinbeck         
Adventure Cycling describes todays ride:  "At Leggett you'll leave US 101 and return to the coast via SR1, but not before climbing abruptly to 2,000 feet above sea level. From either direction this road is a steep, twisting climb and descent on a narrow roadway that is hemmed in by heavy forest cover.  Allow ample time for the arduous 28 miles between Leggett and Westport." I guess some would think it arduous but I thought it was spectacular.  Not many cars on SR1, thankfully, because the road twisted and turned all the way up and all the way down.  As I approached the coast I rode in and out of fog banks and it was very cold.  At Westport we had coffee at a funky Inn where the Innkeeper offered us samplings of his homemade jams for us to sample along with our bagel.  I left Westport and stayed on Hwy 1 to Fort Bragg.  The road hung precariously along the rocky coast. This was a gear shifting challenge because the road was so twisty that at one moment you were going down a steep grade only to come around a very sharp corner to a steep uphill. I had to be on my toes constantly, watching for traffic and making sure I was in the right gear. I listened to my musicand had a blast!  I met my Aunt in Mendocino where we had lunch and then drove back to Ukiah.       
After spending three days in Ukiah off the bike I was ready to hit the road and begin this last week of my journey.  My Aunt protested when I told her I was riding from Ukiah to Mendocino and at one point had me convinced that she would drive me here but the more I thought about it the more I felt like I needed to ride.  My cousin has a home on over an acre of land in Ukiah and it is like a litle farm, complete with numerous animals-chickens, guinea pigs, a baby bearded dragon, (a lizard that will grow to be very, very large!) four cats, (one of them treated us one night by dragging a baby snake into the house!) and three dogs, two large and one small.  Well, this morning as I was leaving the driveway on my bike Emma and Chalupa decided to follow me so I turned around, guided them back, closing the gate behind me. I started off down the hill and half a mile later I see Emma running behind me! I tried to tell her NO, and GO HOME but she was insistant on following me.  I was not wanting to turn around and escort her back home so I called Ron on the cell phone and he had  to come and get her with the truck.  Seems they forgot to tell me that she was supposed to  be locked in a special gated area of their yard. Sorry Ron! The road from Ukiah to Booneville is very, very steep with NO shoulder but the loaded logging trucks were all going downhill and I was going up.  Things leveled out a bit and I rode through more vineyards.  Seems like the wineries keep expanding north and west of Napa and Sonoma. I passed about a dozen tasting rooms but decided it would probably not be a good idea to stop and imbibe in the spirits, knowing I had another 40 some miles to ride.  I rode through another beautiful section of redwoods close to the coast.  These forests are much younger than the ones up north but they hold much promise if the loggers don't get to them first.  I stopped at the Von Damme Beach which is a short distance from the Glendeven Inn where I am staying for the next two nights. The beach was rather small and after a few moments I found a large piece of driftwood that was just the perfect size to lay down upon.  I tried to start gathering my thoughts for my ending journal pages that I need to work on but after 61 miles I was enjoying a blissful nap, to the sounds of the ocean! So, now I am at the Glendeven Inn. I just took a nice hot bath and soon will join the other guests and the Innkeepers for some wine and appetizers.  I decided to come to Mendocino because my husband and I just love this quaint, seaside village and I wanted a few days to begin the process of gathering all my feelings and thoughts about this summer.  I wanted to do it in a very quiet, peaceful place where I can stroll the beautiful gardens, walk the beaches and listen to the ocean and hopefully be inspired to put my thoughts into words.  I feel that if I don't do it now it may never happen. A lot is waiting for me when I return home so I will indulge myself and hope that I am productive. P.S. Happy Birthday to our daughter Jennifer who celebrated her 19th birthday yesterday! Also, today is her first day of the new year at Colorado State University so, time to hit the books again, girl!     
August 27, 2002 A day to reflect, write and cry! (Yesterday) I awoke this morning and stepped outside to fix a flat that occurred on my rear tire after I arrived yesterday.  In front of the B&B I met two women, Linda and Nancy, who had their tripods set up and were photographing the beautiful flowers in the garden. We chatted for a while and they invited me to join them in Mendocino for lunch.  I had a nice two mile walk and met the girls at an outside cafe overlooking the ocean.  I immediately felt a connection with these strangers. They are about my age and have such energy and love of life. They had spent some time in Bandon, Oregon where Nancy was doing a photography workshop. Her workshops are about encouraging personal vision and they emphasize intimate landscapes with an interpretive emphasis. They were so excited about my ride and we talked a lot about role models, being women, and cool stuff like that.  When we left we went to their car and Nancy loaned me a book titled, "Everday Sacred" by Sue Bender. The book is based on the monk that would take a begging bowl to the village each day. Whatever was placed in the bowl was enough!  Even if it had two grains of rice in it!  The author encourages us to approach every day with this 'bowl.' And no matter what is put in the bowl, rather it be good or not so good, to acknowledge it and be thankful for it.  If the bowl gets too full than we need to make it less full so that we have room to grow and learn. This book was placed before me at a very unique time in my life.  What a blessing to meet such incredible women! I returned to the B&B and found a comfy chair in the living room and began working on my Final Chapter!  At one point the Innkeeper, Higgins asked me how I was doing?  I told him I was making progress but that I thought I needed a box of kleenex. He turned around and within seconds was holding a box for me!  Can you tell I'm getting a little emotional here? But the words (and tears) started to flow and I feel good about what I wrote. August 28, 2002 I awoke this morning and felt horrible!!  I was dizzy, my stomach was upset and for a moment I didn't know if I could ride today.  I just wanted to crawl back into my beautiful down filled bed and go back to sleep.  But Linda and Nancy were having breakfast with me and I knew that I had the next three nights of hotels booked so I got a cup of coffee and went outside for some fresh air. We had a wonderful breakfast with such inspiring conversation. We chatted with Martha and Michael, a couple from the Bay area that are moving to New Mexico to begin a new business and a new life by opening a retreat center on 65 acres of land.  By the end of breakfast I was feeling better so I packed up to leave. The ride down the coast continues to be breathtaking but today the winds were not in my favor and I fought extreme winds coming from the south all day long. I stopped for some chicken soup and peppermint tea and was thankful when I got to my hotel in Point Arena. I think my body wants to go home!  Four more days!     
This area of the California is called the Lost Coast.  I never could find out where the name came from but it is pretty desolate along this stretch.  The enormous rocks stand like arsenels along the coastal waters and the land is pretty barren except for an occasional dairy farm. It is weird to see cows grazing so close to the ocean. I wonder if they enjoy the salt air as much as I do?  The coastal waters also have a lot of sea kelp floating on the surface and around Gualala I heard the bark of the sea lions on the rocks but the road was too far up the cliff for me to see them. Hwy 1 weaves up and down and in and around the various coves with little seaside villages that hardly deserve a dot on the map.  I stopped at one such town and inquired at the General Store if there were restaurants in town and I was told, 'this IS the town.' This afternoon my aunt met up with me at our hotel just north of Fort Ross.  We drove south by car to check out Fort Ross. It was closed but a sign in front of one of the old houses talked about the area in the 'olden days' when herds of cattle and sheep were raised here and huge potato farms were cultivated.  The farmers took the potatoes by boats to the towns along the coast. I wonder if that is why they put potatoes in the clam chowder?  Just wondering. I have a lot of time to do that these days!   "Travel has been my comrade, adventure my inspiration, accomplishment my recompense."  Charlotte Cameron
OK, can I start tooting my horn??  What a happy day I had.  I listened to music and felt like Superwoman screaming around the corners and effortlessly moving up and down the hills along the coast.  My body had served me well this summer.  NO days of illness or injury! My thighs feel like steel and my heart and lungs no longer burn and scream in pain when I work up the hills. (Standing, I might add!  Which I have never enjoyed doing on a bike!)  I do not feel like I will turn 50 in a few weeks! Tomorrow around Pt. Reyes I will turn inland off the coast and start heading toward San Francisco. The coast has been such a special part of my ride and I have immersed myself in the salt air and sounds of the ocean.  Today in particular the salt air was very strong and with an overcast day the eucalyptus     
Kudos to Adventure Cycling and their awesome maps.  I left Bodega Bay this morning and followed their routing along some very interesting roads and paths that I would have never been able to find on my own!  I rode through Fairfax, San Anselmo,Kentfield,Larkspur and up the hills to Corte Medera.  At the top of the mountain I looked left and saw the most beautiful sight I have dreamed of for months-the city of San Francisco. It was completely shrouded in fog but you could see the tops of the buildings so it looked like they were just floating on a cloud.  To the left was the tops of the Bay Bridge.  I got to Mill Valley and found the bike path that leads to Sausalito and before I knew it I was in Sausalito. I stopped to take a picture of the Hwy 101 sign directing cars onto the Golden Gate Bridge.  How long I have pictured this sign in my mind.  I return a phone call to my Mother and find myself on this bike path, crying. Passersby hopefully figure out what is happening if they observe the Coasting 2002 logo on my packs. Later, a very helpful woman at the bus stop told me a better way to the city was on a ferry.  Another helpful local on a bike led me to the pier and at 3:15 I was on the ferry to the city.  On the ferry I met Dimitri.  He was on his way to his hotel job-close to our hotel-and was kind enough to show me the shortcuts. Well, I say shortcuts but I'm really not sure.  Before I knew it we were on Market Street heading UP to Powell. You know the picture if you've been to San Francisco. I say to Dimitri, 'we're going up THERE??  Dimitri is from Greece so in his broken English he tells me "we keep going up hill and I tell you later where we will turn!" I started pacing myself and a few red lights helped with the heart rate.  Green light-Dimitri is now on the sidewalk trotting/pushing his bike up the hill and I am still trying to prove something-I don't know what. I look around and I see every other sane person pushing their bike up to Powell so I joined the ranks.  We said goodbye at his stopping point and I screamed down four blocks to the Canterbury Union Square.  I am now enjoying a scotch and soda and will go next door for some sushi before Doug and Jen join me for the beginning of the celebrations.  Yeah, LIFE IS GOOD! "My homeless Mother has been found!"  Jennifer Marie Sims     
A happy and bittersweet morning.  Doug and Jennifer drove me back to Sausalito and I knew that I was but miles from the ending of Coasting 2002. I worked my way up the hills of the south part of Sausalito and after asking a few local riders, found my way to the west entrance of the bridge.  I had a few minutes to spare to give family and friends time to gather at our meeting spot on the south side of the bridge.  Local biking groups were all curious about my ride so I passed the time telling them about my journey.  At 11:30 I started crossing. It was a spectacular morning with a little bit of fog but clear for the most part.  At the half way point I saw Doug and Jennifer. Doug had a huge bouquet of flowers and Jen was holding a sign that she made that said, "Way 2 Go Mom!" I got teary eyed but was just happy to be there, having thought about that very moment so many times in the past.  The end was inevitable and it was time to rejoice, not cry.  We slowly worked our way down the last half of the bridge, stopping a few times to wave to people (strangers) on the other side of the bridge who were taking my picture and hollering congratulations!  Towards the end a bunch of my cousins and friends started cheering and clapping.  We all managed to reunite, hug, laugh and take tons of pictures.  Strangers kept coming up to me wanting to know all about the ride. I called my parents and shared the joy with them and then we loaded the bike and headed to the hotel where Doug spent an hour disassembling the bike for the trip back to Colorado. We shared a glass of champagne together at the hotel and then we all met the group at 5:00 at Fiore d'Italia, a wonderful Italian restaurant in North Beach for the celebratory dinner. Final mile count on the bike computer was 4, 744 miles!  What a ride, what a journey, what an experience!!   P.S.  Doug and I arrived back in Boulder on the night of the 2nd after taking Jennifer back to CSU in Fort Collins.  My sweet friend Christy had dropped off a cooler with a welcome home note and an ice cold beer-a Boulder Beer!  It is good to be home. Thanks girlfriend!! Please see the Final Chapter for reflection and my final thoughts on Coasting 2002.         
Where do I begin??...........at a loss for words.................scattered pictures runnng amok in my brain...........like so many seashells scattered on the beach. My daughter's sweet soulful voice is on the phone this morning asking me if I am meditating.  I have come to a beautiful Bed and Breakfast in Mendocino, California to spend a few days by myself.  To reflect, ponder, search, question, and celebrate. The result of all this will be my final chapter. (Of this particular story, anyway.)   I have managed to put all the seashells into a shoebox.  You see, I have been collecting them all summer long.  The box is very full so I spill the box out at my feet and begin to pick up each shell.  Each one has a memory painted on it.  There are so many of them. I decide that I need to sort them out and put them in some kind of piles so that I can explain each pile to you.  The Shell Neclace: I strung these shells together as I went along this summer. I wore it each day to remind me of the friends in my life that inspired me, coached me on and always believed in me.  There is John Accardi and Doug Speirn-Smith, coaxing me up Trail Ridge Road in Colorado and celebrating with me at the top. A day shared with special friends that I will always remember. This shell is Betty Frazier, giggling and smiling as she sags me through the Sawtooths.  There is Rick and Karen, Tom and Kristy, Karen and Gary, Kim, Muffy, Patti and Robin, Nancy and Bob, Penny and Bob, Dora and Valvin, Laurie and Gordon, John and Nancy, Pete, Susan, Allen and Betty, Freeman and Peggy, Roland and Sandee, Christy and Doug, Chris, Nancy P., Nancy B., Bill and Jill, Carol, Sharon, Faye, Marlene, Diane, Cindy, Kathy, Mary Jo, Mike and Mark who were so dedicated in their frequent emails that so inspired me, made me laugh and just kept me in touch with life back home. Wow, what a beautiful neclace! I will wear it often. Thank you from the bottom of my heart! The Familial Shells: Wow, this group of shells all kind of look alike! My sister Marlene joined me for a week in Kansas and remarked how there are some things I do that remind her of herself! Like the way I chew or the way I pronounce certain words. Funny how different we can be as siblings but yet how similar as well. I look at this pile with warmth in my heart. My family came through with shining colors this summer.  I have such dear memories and I just want to mention a few. Of course, there is that crazy bagel that Marlene hung on a sign in Kansas.  And who could forget the story of the temptation to steal the warm beer from the pickup truck?  We had tons of time to talk and solve all of our problems, didn't we?  Thanks for the memories, Marlene! You were a real trooper. Keep riding, would you? Then my baby sis, Cindy, met me in Steamboat and rode with me for a week through Utah and up to Wyoming.  Cindy, I hope you check your bed each night.  You never know if you will find undies or porn magazines there! You were awesome and had perhaps the roughest week of the ride.  The heat was unbearable but meeting Bill Perry gave us the hope and inspiration to keep pedaling.  I will never eat another hamburger no matter how hungry I am!  I enjoyed all the sister talk time that we had and look forward to the next time.  Mom and Dad, where do I begin?  At first you only wanted to sag me in Iowa and then after your new motorhome arrived you were anxious to hit the road and you sagged me through all of Illinois and most of Iowa.  I felt like a spoiled brat the whole time-being totally catered to and so well cared for. Mom your cooking is delicious as always and Dad, thanks for the help with all the flats and mechanical stuff.  We all had so much fun that you decided to come back for another two weeks through all of Oregon!  I remember so well taking Dad's picture as he was standing on that picnic table with his rolled up pant legs!! And the day I was so mad at you that I didn't want to talk to you after you were missing in action for hours.  They say you never stop worrying about your kids but it goes the other way as well!  I loved the walk on the beach in Florence and later sharing a celebratory martini after I reached the west coast.  Your dedication to your children is obvious and I will cherish the memories. You truly are the best and I love you! To my sister Diane and her husband Mike. You opened your home to me and made me feel very welcome.  I just have two requests-I need a ladder for the bunkbed and would you please figure out what time Mass is?  Thanks for all the repair work on the bike and for all the salty snacks. To my sister Mary Jo who so painstakingly edited, cut and pasted my journal pages and then copied them a dozen times over to mail to family and friends that did not have daily access to a computer.  You were the lifeline that kept everyone connected with my ride. You are simply the best! Cousin Margaret-so many times people look at us and ask if we are sisters.  You are like a sis to me and the week we spent together was so much fun.  Even though you worked my ass off and kept up a hellish pace.  The only way that I could catch my breath was to holler that I wanted to take a picture! I will frame the 3 shots that I took of your back as that is what I always saw every day-but hey, I got to see the naked guy-you missed him because you were going too fast!!  What can I say? Mike, Nicole and Austin, thank you for taking time to drive to Iowa to visit with me and sag me for two days.  You know how much I miss having the grandbabies in Boulder for two weeks this summer so seeing you for a few days was so sweet.  Next time we'll find a better hotel.  Don't put so much air in those tires next time, OK Mike?  Also, thanks for the encouraging emails that always made me smile. My kids James, Mark and Jennifer were always there with so much pride and joy over what I was doing.  I never heard a discouraging word from them.  James threw a good luck stone into the Atlantic Ocean for me and sent me the sweetest emails! Mark told me that he was proud of me and marveled that usually it's the other way around-parents being proud of their kids. Jennifer-my sweet child. For three summers in a row you were off exploring Europe and this summer I was the one who flew the coop and left you home in charge. I know that you missed not having your Mother around this summer so I have a lot of making up to do when I return. Thanks for your responsibility and care of our home and feeding Dad all those wonderful meals you prepared. The Shells with Pearls: I only found two of those on the beach and they deserve very special mention.  One is my husband Doug. I look back at the first 10 days we spent together and how very lucky I was to have you with me and keep the show going.  My lowest point was the night that I cried through the whole Italian dinner wondering what the hell I had done. The high point was the night before you were to fly home from Cleveland and the vote of confidence you gave me and the faith you had in me that I could do this. I also have numerous memories that make me chuckle-your graceful flip into the mud and your true spirit in the pouring rain.  I dedicated a whole page of my journal to you and I meant every word I said but I will say one more time-Thank You and I Love You!  I'm comin' home, fluff up my pillow!  My other pearl is my greatest friend Christy.  She sagged me from Rock Springs, Wyoming to Pocatello, Idaho. We were together for about 12 days and I had the time of my life with her. She came with a car loaded with so many Italian goodies that for lunch each day I thought I was in Tuscany again!  She was the encouragment behind the 98 mile record day and I will always remember the cold beer that we shared after-I was on such a high!  I won't say what you don't wear to bed at night as people might start talking and luckily you don't snore at night so you make a fabulous travel partner. You truly are a lustrous pearl in my life.  Thanks! Some Very Unique Shells: There are a handfull of gems that are real keepers: Margaret's husband Ron sagged us down the Oregon Coast and took his responsibilites very seriously.  At the end of each day there was a bottle of chilled wine, local cheeses and crackers.  He scoped out the hotel scene and had the truck unloaded each night.  In the morning he would have to reload everything while we attended to our bike duties.  Ron, please don't wear those sperm bike socks in your Corvette.  You don't need any more help in that department!  If you ever see licorice salt water taffy, send me a bag, would you? Thanks also to Ron's sister Pat and her husband Fred for sharing their home and dinner in Bandon, Oregon. Hats off to Christy's brother Russ Speirn and his wife Marilyn for opening their home to us in Pocatello.  There is nothing better than a home bed and home cooking when you are on the road.  Also Allen and Betty Frazier in Boise.  Betty sagged me for four days through the Sawtooths with her grandaughters, Sara and Katie.  We had so much fun and caught up on old times.  Allen, you did a superb job covering up the airplane ride story to Cedar City, Utah where Doug was waiting with a surprise visit.  Very well planned.  But next time I would like a raft that doesn't leak!  Keep working on the retirement thing, I think you've almost got it figured out. To my last but not least sagger-my Aunt Marion.  You joined me through the beautiful California Redwoods and I will always remember the cute cabin in the woods on the Avenue of the Giants and the not so cute cabin in Leggett.  You are a very special part of my life and I am so happy that we were able to spend these special days together. Next time we will control ourselves and not order dessert every night! The Scattered Shells: All shapes and sizes, each holding a very unique memory of Coasting 2002.  The beautiful Bed and Breakfast's I stayed in.  The not so beautiful, old, rundown places that were protection for the night but that I just as soon forget about.  The homecooked meals in smalltown U.S.A. where Granny was in the kitchen cooking her heart out and filling me with nourishment for the day.  The mountain passes that loomed at me on the maps and made me anxious the night before I was to attempt them.  There was Rabbit Ears Pass and Galena Pass.  And of course Trail Ridge Road and McKenzie Pass.  There were all the bike tourists that I met and exchanged stories with. The German couple with their 20 month old baby in a trailer made me smile. What memories they will have.  Or the young single guy who was anxious for his ride to end so he could go home to his sweetheart.  There was also the first tourist that I met who happened to be from Boulder.  There are the sights and smells that filled my lungs and heart with so much pure oxygen that I thought I would burst! I have so many shells in this pile and so many memories that I could go on forever. There were the beautiful animals that I saw every day.  The birds that wanted to sit on my helmet, the cows that ran along the fence with me and the crazy dogs that made my heart race. There were the roadside memorials to loved ones lost in car accidents and all the signs acknowledging groups that attempt to keep America clean by picking up trash. There were the numerous railroad crossings that I finally learned to maneuver across after almost becoming front page news.  There were all the times I stopped my bike in record time so that I could answer the cell phone and not miss anyone's call. I look forward to reading my own journal in the months to come to relive all the things that I experienced. There are so many of them!  I hope that I touched on some of the special ones! The Mirrored Shell: I pick this unusual shell up and I see my reflection!  I think I'll throw it back in the pile.  No?  Well, OK, but I have never been very comfortable with talking about myself.  I'm sure that everyone is anxious for me to get back home and see how this trip has changed me.  I may not be able to talk about it for a while.  I don't even know that I can write about it right now but I will make an attempt and if necessary, at a later date I can add or change as I look back. I have always loved the outdoors and I have always been athletic.  I spent the first 13 years of my life on a farm so obviously I spent a lot of time outdoors.  At age 15, months before my junior year in high school I went off to the Boundary Waters Canoe Area in northern Minnesota and experienced a month at Minnesota Outward Bound.  There I learned how much I really loved the outdoors and survived all the challenges of the program including a 3 night solo on my very own island!  Those experiences at that school have served me well throughout my life. The Outward Bound motto is "To serve, to strive and not to yield."  In my early 20's I played softball and joined the running team for the computer company that I worked for.  I remember my first 10K road race. I was pathetic.  It was in St. Paul, Minn and there were several thousand runners. I came in dead last!  All the scaffolding was taken down and all the runners were inside, enjoying the free beer and food.  I took off my running number and went to the stage, handed my tag to the speaker and told him that I wanted to make sure I would be listed among the participants as having completed the run!  Sad!  I should have given up the sport then and there.  But no, there is one thing that I do have and that is perserverance!  A few years later I trained with my then teenage sister, Cindy and we competed in a half-marathon in Iowa. Again, dead last.  But my father was there, following me in the car in case I wanted to jump in and escape. But I crossed the finish line with a smile!  Since then I have successfully completed the New York City and Los Angeles marathons!  I even placed respectably in my age group!  I gave up running and started doing more hiking, snowshoeing and skiing in the last 10 years.  As a youth I was an avid water skier and last summer I had to prove that I could still get up on skis.  It took me a year to heal a severe hamstring injury!  About 8 years ago my husband and I did an 6 day bicycle tour in British Columbia. We biked from Banff to Jasper and I was hooked!  For several years we took part in the Denver Children's Hospital Courage Classic, a 3 day, intense ride in the Colorado Rockies.  Every time I got on my bike I was in heaven.  Whenever I would see a cross country rider, pulling a trailer or toting bulging packs I was so envious of what they were doing.  I decided I wanted to experience it myself. In all the sports that I have taken part in it was never important to me how fast I was or how good I was. What was the most important was how good I felt about myself after I did t. When we moved to Boulder I joined a hiking group.  At age 40 I was the baby of the group. How inspired I was by the youthfulness and vitality of these women. I resolved to stay active and not let age slow me down.  However, I have seen the last of a pair of water skiis! I remember the 81 old triathlete who helped my sister and I in northwest Colorado-he told me how proud he was of what I was doing and that I inspired him!  Well, I think it was the other way around.  After my son came to Iowa with Nicole and Austin I received an email from Nicole. She said, "You are a very cool Grandma!" If there is one younger woman that I have inspired through this ride than it was worth every pedal stroke. I have many role models that I aspire to be like 'when I grow up.'  My cabin neighbor Lillian who at 93 still cooks, travels, and has a sparkle in her eye when she talks about all her planned travels and activities. My mother-in-law Betty Denesha who at 82 plays tennis, golfs and lifts weights regularly!  I love reading about Isabella Bird who was a pioneer woman who explored the west, on a horse, wearing a skirt!   So, here I am!  My persistance and determination are no longer a dream but a dream come true.  For the first time in my life I have had three and a half months all to myself.  Without the demands of my job or my domestic duties at home.  I have had hours spent on the bike, leisurely perusing the countryside; singing at the top of my lungs or quietly reflecting each moment of the day. I have had free time to read, hike, browse or have reflective conversations with family and friends. I will always cherish the hospitality of strangers that I met along the way and will remember the many kindnesses they showered on me. I worry about going back to the real world.  I have seen things at such a slow pace, with so few worries and anxieties.  I want to make changes in my life that will allow me the freedom to do more of the important things in life and less of the mundane.  How do I find that happy balance?  I guess it is something that I will need to work on every day. Remember the bowl, accept and be thankful for what is in it every day. In closing I have only two thoughts.  One is that when I wrote about my ride in one of the opening  chapters I said, 'stay tuned.' And I'd like to close with those same words.  Who knows where my next adventure will take me but I know there will be another, so ...........stay tuned. (How do you say bicycle and cooked egg in Japanese??) One of my hobbies is collecting quotations that I use in my journaling and in my scrapbooks and one of my alltime favorites is: "Here I am, safely returned over those peaks from a journey far more beautiful and strange that anything I had hoped for or imagined-how is it that this safe return brings such regret?"  Peter Mathiessen, American writer I have now taken all the shells and strung them together in one huge neclace. I will wear it often with joy in my heart. It is not heavy or burdensome because it tells a very special story of a very special summer-COASTING 2002! Thank You to everyone that has helped me and supported me in this dream.  I love you all and could not have done this without you!  You were the wind beneath my wings! Gladys Marie Sims September 2, 2002
A couple of hours later, I was standing with my Cannondale on a slab of concrete in the middle of nowhere watching the train pull away. I was sure the conductor had said this was Madera. There was, however, no trace of a city or of much else either. I was standing on a concrete and pipe rail structure that resembled a cattle loading chute. I scanned the horizon for a city skyline and, finding none, started out on the only road west and hoped. A few miles later I found the town, stopped at a local convenience store, and procured water for my three bottles and direction out of town. My destination for the day was Hanford. The roads were full of traffic until after 8:00 when, presumably, everyone got to work. There was a gentle tailwind which was not much help but certainly didn't impede my progress and I was able to maintain a nice 16 mph pace. The scenery was grapes and groves. I had a muffin and coffee on the train, saving breakfast proper for twenty or so miles down the road. I stopped in Kerman according to plan and found a little coffee shop which looked OK. It's always a puzzle whether to stop at the first place or go on a little farther, hoping to find a better restaurant. This place had good food as witnessed by all the locals already there ahead of me. My pancakes took about 45 minutes to get to me and about five minutes to eat. I had lost some time but the tailwind would help me gain it back. Lunch was to be in Caruthers. My usual on the road meals consist of pancakes in the morning and rice and corn tortillas at mid-day. I am a sort of vegetarian, making exceptions for a little chicken, fish and chile verde from time-to-time. I also eat tons of non-fat cheese, yogurt, cottage cheese and milk. It tastes great to me but then it's been so long since I've had the fatty variety I probably wouldn't know. Getting in and out of Caruthers was the biggest challenge of the day. For a ten mile radius around the town all dogs are apparently free to roam unfettered, looking for bicycle targets of opportunity. There are probably more dog chases occurring there than anywhere, with the possible exception of Arkansas. The vehicular traffic was, for the most part, well-behaved. The commercial truckers almost always pulled far out into the other lane to pass me when circumstances allowed. I usually gave them a friendly wave to show my appreciation. Having said that, I must say that people's tolerance for bikes deteriorated the farther south I went. I attribute this not to the locale but to the time of day. In the morning, the folks in cars still had cheery hopes for a great day. By mid-afternoon they were possessed of no such illusions and were decidedly grumpier. It was only mid-afternoon when I arrived in Hanford, so after a fudge sundae fuel stop I decided to press on to Corcoran. This was more progress than was originally planned, especially since I had gone an extra 8 miles by missing a turnoff south of Kerman. I was pedaling merrily along towards Coalinga when I woke up. By 4:00 pm I was cruising into Corcoran and 100 miles was coming up on the odometer. The Budget Inn had a room (they always do) and life was good. 
After she showed up 15 minutes late and I was stoked with the usual pancakes, I decided to hit the road before dawn. I had lights and I knew the road immediately south had a nice shoulder, having made this part of the trip several times before. By the time I got to the narrow shoulder, it would be light. I left Corcoran with all the prison employees heading south. Prisons are a big industry for some of the little towns in the Southern San Joaquin Valley. Then, after sunrise, there was nothing but that boring stretch between Corcoran and Wasco to test my resolve. This forty mile stretch always seems twice that distance to me. To top it off, I had lost my tailwind and even had a slight headwind at times. The boredom was only relieved once by the two dogs at the junkyard south of Colonel Allensworth State Park, real junkyard dogs, giving chase. But they had allowed me to get past them before giving chase so there was no contest. A stop at Teresa's in Wasco for more rice and tortillas led to the final ride into Bakersfield. I felt OK and the bike performed flawlessly with no flats. The train makes these little jaunts possible.  Amtrak San Joaquin trains have three bike racks in each car. This allows you to 'roll on' your bike without boxing it. Of course, as with any intrepid traveler, you may have to improvise. You could be faced with bike racks obscured with piles of bags and luggage, in which case you must discreetly rearrange the offending pieces to accommodate your bike. Amtrak only provides the racks, they don't guaranty that you can access them. My next goal is to ride Amtrak to Oakland, then cycle back to Bakersfield. Anyone want to come along?

First, Tom Jolliffe, the "old man" of the group, at the ripe age of over 50.  Tom is an accountant, and the manager at a London credit union.  Tom has been an avid cyclist for many years with the London Cycling Club, and has completed many bike tours with myself, including tours through Germany and England. Tom and I had originally planned to cycle the Icefields Parkway in 2000, but due to a work requirement, we agreed to reschedule for a later date. We were to find out the wait was well worth it! Tom rides a light blue Marinoni touring bike.  Paul Delconte, the youngest member of our trio, and the only one with any amount of hair, has been a friend for many years.  Paul works for the company formerly known as Imation. Paul works for the company formerly known as Imation. Paul works for a company called DecisionOne. Paul is an electronics technician, and repairs testing equipment used by telephone and utility companies. We share a common bond in that we both have sons with developmental handicaps.  I had joined Paul in the past on small day trips with our respective partners.  I have been trying for several years to get Paul to join the London Cycling Club.  Last year, I finally succeeded, and Paul was soon engrossed with the idea of cycle touring.  Paul's "steed" is a red Norco mountain bike. The gearing on this bike was great for a trip through the Rockies, but Paul falls behind a bit on the flats (understandably so).  We are gradually swaying Paul toward the purchase of a road bike. One more year, and I think we'll have him hooked. Lastly, myself - Kevin Rodger.  I am a pilot for Air Canada Jazz.  I've been cycling since I was a kid, but just got back into cycling in a serious way about eleven years ago.  I try to combine my love of travel with my passion for cycling.  I joined the London Cycling Club, and rode my (at that time) fifteen year old Nishiki 10 speed to many rides.  In the second year of my membership, I purchased a Cannondale H-400 hybrid bike, which I still use to do the occasional tour.  I have toured Mexico (from Cancun to the border of Belize), Germany, England, Bermuda, Antigua, and most of the province of Ontario by bicycle.  The next tour I am planning is from Salzburg to Budapest along the Danube River bike trail.  I have been riding a Mikado D'Iberville touring bike for about five years.  My next upgrade - a Bruce Gordon Rock 'n' Road touring bike (if I have my way on the home front).  THE RIDE We were to be rewarded with reasonable weather (no rain or snow), and some of the world's most spectacular scenery.  The Icefields Parkway technically covers the 230 kilometre stretch of road from Lake Louise to Jasper.  We added a couple of hundred extra kilometres by cycling from the Calgary Airport to Banff and then via the Bow Valley Parkway.  The hardest things to figure out were which way we were going to cycle, our enroute accommodations, and how to get back to the airport.  The route we chose from south to north, was picked solely on the availability of flights: there are more flights to the Calgary Airport from Toronto than from Toronto to the Edmonton Airport.  Many people have asked me which direction would be easier.  While I'm no expert on cycling through the Rockies, I would have to say it doesn't really matter - there are two big climbs and two fantastic descents no matter which way you go!  As for wind, we didn't really have a whole lot of that, except on the first couple days, so I really can't comment.Originally, I had wanted to make this excursion into a camping vacation.  However, neither Tom, nor Paul wanted this - I knew Tom was not a camper, but I thought Paul might like to try it.  In the end, the decision to use hostels instead of camping was a bit of a godsend, as many of the campgrounds were closed to tent camping due to a problem with bears. Although there were lots of bear sightings, we personally did not see any.  We did, however wonder why there were lumps of bear "poop" spaced every 500 feet or so along the shoulder of the Parkway.  The hostels we used were ideally spaced for bike touring.  We stayed at the International Youth hostels in Banff, Lake Louise (our unequivocal favourite), Rampart Creek, Beauty Creek, and Jasper.  We were also scheduled to stay at the Mount Edith Cavell Hostel, but my two comrades mutinied (something about showers, or lack thereof), and we bypassed Mt. Edith Cavell in favour of a hotel in Jasper.  More about this sad tale later     
We left Calgary International Airport at approximately 1:30 p.m., bound for our first day's destination of Cochrane.  We selected Cochrane because we originally were unsure of what time we would arrive in Calgary, plus we thought 150 km in one day on fully loaded touring bikes was not much of a holiday. As I mentioned, the weather was partly cloudy with a few very light showers along the way.  The route we took us north of the airport through two street lights on Barlow Trail for (approximately 2 km).  We then turned left (west) on Country Hills Blvd.  This route was generally uphill through the northern part of the city until turning south west on Stoney Trail to connect with Highway 1A (running north-west) for the remaining 19 km. into Cochrane. The route we selected was generally gently undulating terrain, with some very pleasant scenery.  We enjoyed a fairly wide shoulder about eight feet wide, narrowing to about four to six feet during the last 10 kilometres of the ride. In the last 3 km. Before you enter town, this road takes a very nice, steep downhill "dive" into the city.  On this section of road, I obtained a top speed of 68 kph.  Not bad, considering we were combating a 30 kph headwind, and were riding fully loaded touring bikes! Just after arriving, we were greeted by a rather large rain shower.  Timing is everything!   We checked into the Super 8 Motel, where we were well received by the staff.  We were allowed to keep our bikes inside the locked boardroom for the night.  Our room was very large, and included three queen size beds.  The price was perhaps a bit high, at $150 for the night, but after splitting the price three ways, it was reasonable.  The price included an ample continental breakfast in the morning.That night we ate at the Boston Pizza restaurant just across the road from the Super 8 Motel.  Total distance travelled for the day:  43 km, total time on the bike: 2 hours, 26 minutes, for an average speed of 17.6 kph.  I know it sounds slow, but the wind was brutal!     
     We arrived in Banff at 2:00 p.m., travelling the 114.8 km. In 5 hours and 22 minutes (which also includes a slow ride up to Sulphur Mountain for a soak in the Hot Springs).   Our average speed was 21.4 kph, and once again I reached a maximum speed of 68 kph. Since we could not check into our rooms at the hostel until after 1500, we decided to ride up Sulphur Mountain to have a dip in the Upper Hot Springs.  We dropped our panniers off in the available lockers.  Tom got a bit frustrated, as the locker he selected ate his loonie.  I did not know this, and while he was out of the locker area, I deposited a loonie, and locked the locker. Tom needed an item out of the locker, so we opened it up again, deposited another loonie only to have the locker once again malfunction.  The frustration had begun!  After sorting this mess out, we rode towards the hot springs.  Halfway up the mountain, I heard several expletives emanating from the person riding the Marinoni bike - something to the effect of "What the "heck" am I doing this for?  I don't need this "funky" aggravation!"  Tom never made it all the way up the mountain.  Tom never got a "ride" in the hot springs.  Paul and I continued the slow grind up, and were rewarded with some great views (including those of the mountain vista), and we were able to rest our weary muscles in the 39C pool.  All this for only $10.00, including the use of an official Upper Hot Springs towel! Due to a computer issue at the hostel, our reservation for the night was lost - and the hostel was full (it was Thursday night, after all).  We were assured by the hostel that they would find us beds after 6:00 p.m.  Tom had already checked out a few hotels, so we told the hostel that if they couldn't find a room, that is was OK.  Tom called to confirm the hotel room, but he was informed it was already taken.   When we were finally assigned a room in the hostel, we found it was already occupied.  We waited another 45 minutes before we were finally assigned beds, but in two separate rooms.  Paul and Tom got to bunk in with girls from Germany and France.  Some guys got all the luck.  I got the "Italian" suite - three friends from Milan.  This room probably would have been better for Paul, as he speaks fluent Italian.  The problem was, it took me a while to figure out which language they were speaking. The time was now after 6:00 p.m. Dinner this night was at the hostel - I expected inexpensive food, but it was about the same price as anywhere else in town.  However, the portions were very large.  Actually, I got off pretty light here - after a few beers, followed by dinner, and another beer, I retired to my room.  Only after I retired for the evening did I realise I left Cougar Pete's Bar and Grill without paying.  I had only hoped that Paul was not too upset with me for stiffing him with the bill.  I found out the next morning that Cougar Pete's had actually charged him for all three bills (even though Tom had paid his portion).  This was sorted out, and we were (or should I say, I was) once again on good standing.   The Banff Hostel is on a nice setting at the top of a relatively steep hill.  It is a large hostel, with a large contingent of mostly young people from around the world.  It is also very noisy.  The doors are equipped with magnetic card locks.  The problem is the locks don't work very well.  All during the night, as people made their way to the washroom, one could hear the constant clicking of those plastic "credit cards" sliding through the locks. This was followed by a bit of cussing, and finally, apologies to the person who eventually had to get out of bed to let them in.  Not only that, but we found that most people did not retire until after midnight.  I can tell you that after a hard day of cycling, I was ready for bed at 2200! 
          
Bow Valley Parkway is a very palatial road, with little traffic.  It had no shoulders, but we found they weren't necessary.  Every kilometre or so, there were areas where we could pull off the main road to view the scenery or take a rest.  This route was very scenic, especially in the area close to Castle Mountain.  Just before Castle Mountain, there was a rather large downhill.  I traversed this area first, and waited for the rest of the "crew" to arrive.  Next came Paul, after a few minutes.  But alas, there was no Tom.  We waited several minutes for him to arrive to no avail.  We decided to go back and look for him, fearing him may have fallen on the steep downhill, or had a mechanical problem.  Back we climbed for four kilometres, and we finally saw him coming down the hill.  He explained that at the last stop a tie from his pannier had wrapped itself around his front rim, effectively stopping movement of any kind.  We shuddered when we considered the effect this might have had on the downhill portion!   Distance covered today was 79.2 km, in 4 hours, 12 minutes, for an average speed of 18.8 kph.  This speed reflects a steep 4 km section up to the actual lake above the townsite of Lake Louise.  I estimate we climbed about 1400 feet or more in this short distance.  We enjoyed bright sunshine today, with no wind.  It had clouded over by the time we arrived in Lake Louise.  Our park pass was inspected for the first time since entering the park, and we were informed by the attendant that a grizzly bear had been spotted the day before crossing the road 100 metres from the gatehouse.  We did not encounter any bears today, but we did manage to photograph a couple of elk, and we spotted a deer in the woods.   At the hostel we met four American cyclists - Joe and Gerard, and their wives, who were going to be riding the Icefield Parkway southbound from Jasper.  Graciously, they offered to bring some food up to the next two "wilderness" hostels for us.  Paul and I quickly made a dash for the supermarket to rapidly collect some food staples, and a bottle of Merlot wine - our prize upon arrival at Beauty Creek.The Lake Louise Hostel was very nice - close to hotel standards.  The rooms held two bunk beds, and each room had its own toilet and sink.  Showers were right outside the door, and it appeared we shared the shower with only one or two other rooms.  The price was $30.67 apiece, inclusive of taxes.         
We left Lake Louise at 8:00 a.m., but Tom soon discovered that his front rack had a sheared bolt.  This was probably a result of the previous day's ride where the tie had wrapped itself around the wheel rim.  Tom rode back into town to seek out a repair.  Paul and I waited about an hour before Tom arrived from the bike store with a new bolt attached to the rack.  The ride continued.  About 34 kilometres out of Lake Louise, we stopped for lunch on the shore of Bow Lake, the source of the Bow River.  The restaurant was the Num-Ti-Jah Lodge.  The following description of the lake is taken from their web site:  "Num-Ti-Jah Lodge overlooks one of the most dramatic scenes in the Canadian Rockies. Out of Bow Lake the mountains rise steep and rugged. The blue ice of Crowfoot Glacier hangs suspended over the turquoise water. To the west, the craggy peaks of the Great Divide tower over Bow Glacier."  Lunch was buffet style.  We needed this fuel to get us over the upcoming Bow Pass.  Bow Pass was not as difficult as we had feared.  It was long, but the climb was not steep at all - at least in the direction we were heading!  From Lake Louise, at roughly 5000' above sea level, Bow Pass tops out at 6785 feet.  However, there are sever plateaux along the way.  The steepest part of the pass climbs about 800 feet in only six kilometres.   It is all downhill after the pass.  I left Paul and Tom behind on the downward portion of the pass.  Riding downhill is my fort!  Highway 93 generally follows river valleys.  On the north side of Bow Pass we follow along the Mistaya River. The Mistaya eventually joins with the Saskatchewan River.  At Saskatchewan River Crossing, where we had agreed to stop for lunch, I waited for the rest of the gang to arrive.  After fifteen minutes, I can see the whites of Tom's eyes coming up the slight hill into the restaurant.  After a quick snack, and drink, we departed once again for Rampart Creek, only 12 kilometres away. We arrived at the quaint hostel of Rampart Creek around 4:30 p.m. Rampart Creek was virtually deserted at this time.  Only the manager and one other cyclist from Calgary were present.  We took advantage of this quiet time to "case out" the joint and surrounding area.  Rampart Creek Hostel consisted of two accommodation cabins, one food preparation cabin, the manager's cabin, a wood fired sauna, and a very comfortable outhouse located at the entrance to the hostel.  Rampart Creek Hostel was nestled beside a creek with fast flowing glacial water, and high cliff walls around the creek - ample space for nice hiking. Today, we covered 79 km in 4 hours, and thirty-four minutes of cycling, for an average speed of 20.9 kph.  I achieved the respectable speed of 79 kph in one downhill stretch of the Bow Pass. Around the supper hour more people started to arrive, with a tour group consisting of about 10 people, mostly from Australia, New Zealand, Germany and France.  We checked to see if our food had arrived, and were pleasantly surprised that it had.  We enjoyed bowls of soup, and bread. That evening, Paul and I took advantage of the wood burning sauna, completed by a dip in the cool mountain stream running behind the sauna.  Make that "cold" mountain stream!  I believe it was Paul's first experience with a sauna, and predictably, he was the first to venture into the stream.  I say "predictably," because Paul was sitting right beside the fireplace.  The so called "hot seat!"  Paul did not return after this cold foray. Mary, from New Zealand was next, followed by a Korean "team" of three people.       
After Bow Pass, I can honestly say we weren't expecting a real difficult climb. Our profile map, however showed a 1900 foot climb over only 16 kilometres.  The first 18 km climbs quite gradually, then the grade rapidly increases.  Just before the real steep part starts, we stopped for a break at Parker Ridge, just below the Hilda Creek Hostel.  There are many hiking paths evident here, and with more time, we would have liked to have attempted a hike.  Our climb continued   As I had passed Paul and Tom on a downhill stretch prior to the pass, I had a good lead.  I stopped part way up to take some pictures of an impressive waterfall. I could see buses and cars stopped on a hill about 1000 feet above.  That, I thought must be the summit.  I timed a bus as it made its descent downhill to where I had stopped.  It took four minutes.  I estimated it was about five or six kilometres to the upper observation point, and the top of the pass.  Boy, was I wrong! I waited until Tom had caught up with me and we continued on our way.  After climbing for another two kilometres, the road made a turn to the left and started a shallow descent. The road made a big u-turn in a clearing, where we were battered by turbulent winds seemingly coming from all directions.  The climb then restarted in earnest.  After what seemed like hours, we reached the summit.  Tom reached the "top" of the pass first, followed by myself, and then finally Paul.  After taking some pictures of our conquest, we continued on our way.  Around the next bend the climb continued, and continued. The views from the 6676' pass were astounding.  It was impressive to see the terrain we had just covered on our bikes.  Pictures simply do not do it justice. We thought we had reached the top of the pass, but behind the next hill we continued our climb.  The 34 tooth rear cog I had installed the previous week came in handy, and was well utilised.  I still could have used a smaller inner chainring.   The downhill portion of Sunwapta did not seem as steep as Bow Pass, however, I was confident I would be able to exceed 80 kph somewhere along the way. Unfortunately, going downhill I ran into headwinds which impeded my progress.By 1:15 p.m. we found ourselves rolling into the Columbia Icefields.  We ate lunch in the cafeteria because the restaurant side was full.  After lunch we decided to take a Snocoach to the bowels of the glacier.  This cost almost $30, but we felt it was a reasonably value.  Somewhere along the way, the guide told us about the ecological impact visitors had on the Columbia Icefields, and how Brewster Transportation (operators of the Snocoach tours) were trying to minimise it. She mentioned they carried anywhere from 4000 to 4500 visitors per day via Snocoach to the glacier.  We roughly calculated that in a year, Brewster would make roughly $2,000,000 before costs in a short five-month season. We left the icefields behind at 4:25 p.m., and continued the short 18 kilometres to Beauty Creek, arriving at 5:10 p.m., the same time as our American friends were arriving from their southbound trip from Jasper.  Roger and Diane, the managers of the Beauty Creek Hostel had done a lot of renovating, including the installation of a makeshift outdoor shower facility, complete with running warm water.  Cold water was heated by a large propane burner, and then Roger mixed the hot water with cold in a five gallon holding tank to produce the desired effect.  Nothing like a hot shower with a view of the mountains! After showering, we prepared our gourmet supper for the evening - spaghetti with tomato sauce, bread, and a nice bottle of wine to top it all off!  Our total distance for the day was 56.9 kilometres over 3 hours and 19 minutes, for an average speed of 17.1 kph - not bad considering the climb at Sunwapta Pass.           
Some of my fondest times were camping in the Canadian Rockies with my dad.  Mount Edith Cavell held some great memories for me.  My mom still delights in telling stories of how her six year old son climbed half way up Mt. Edith Cavell.  I am sure it was only a couple hundred feet or so, up some well groomed path.  Today's journey was mostly downhill.   Early in the morning, on my way to the impressive Beauty Creek outhouse (it has some interesting quotes to peruse while one does his or her "business"), it was very foggy, and you couldn't see more than 25o metres in front of your nose. By the time we left, however, there was bright sunshine and no evidence of any fog.  The temperature eventually warmed up to 23, and we were able to finally cycle in shorts and jerseys.  We left Beauty Creek around 10:15 a.m.  After 32 kilometres, one bee sting to my temple, and 1hour and 25 minutes of cycling, we reached Sunwapta Falls.  This is a fast moving, narrow falls, with a rather large drop off through a rocky gorge. There are all sort of hiking trails along the sides of the Sunwapta River around the falls, as well as a wooden footbridge to cross for a view from the other side.  We spent about a half-hour at the Falls before proceeding out the road intersection for lunch at the restaurant.We finished lunch and resumed our journey at 1:15 p.m.  Our next stop would be at the equally breathtaking Athabasca Falls.  This stretch of 24 kilometres took us the better part of an hour.  Athabasca Falls had lots more water dropping down a similar gorge to the one in Sunwapta, but I for one did not find it as spectacular.  It was also more crowded. In fact, we bumped into a German couple we had met the previous night in Beauty Creek, and they agreed to take our group shot by the Falls. Cycling out, we stayed on the main highway, #93, instead of 93A.  This meant that we would certainly bypass Mt. Edith Cavell.  I rode by myself, several kilometres ahead of Paul and Tom.  I stopped at the junction where the two roads rejoined, just after crossing over the Athabasca River and waited for my two "comrades."  From this point it, was 5 kilometres back to the junction of the Mt. Edith Cavell Road.  I had contemplated starting out on my own, but I wanted to remain friends with the others, so I waited.  Besides, there was a park entrance, and I didn't know if they could get through without the National Park Pass, which was in my possession.  Upon their arrival, Paul said that they would go on to Jasper, but I was free to go to Mt. Edith Cavell if I wanted.  I thought about the logistics, and I capitulated and agreed to accompany them to Jasper.  Mt. Edith Cavell would have to wait.  We did however take a few pictures in front of a directional sign showing the distance to the turnoff - me with a "thumbs up," Tom and Paul indicating a "thumbs down."  Isn't democracy wonderful? We arrived in Jasper at 4:40 p.m., covering 92.8 K in 3 hours and 51 minutes of cycling time, for an average speed of 24.1 kph.  I attained a maximum speed of 71 kph.  I thought at one point I would surpass my downhill record of 79 kph (also achieved on this trip), but alas, a van pulled out 1/3 down the hill and I had to brake to stay behind him.  I guess that's not bad, considering this was in a 50 kph zone! We found a hotel called the Tonquin Inn, which was very nicely situated and answered the needs of Paul and Tom quite nicely. OK, I admit it - I did enjoy that warm shower, as well! 
Upon Tom and Paul's return, we started off for the hostel, about six kilometers away on a relatively steep uphill.  It is fairly close to the Jasper Tramway, located on Whistler's Mountain.  On the way up this hill, Tom and I decided to stop (yes, it was that steep).  This proved to be a bit of a mistake, as it was very difficult to get the momentum to continue without falling over by the time we re-clipped into our pedals.  Paul, on the other hand, with his mountain bike gearing simply spun away and easily beat us to the hostel. We checked into the hostel, and made another decision.  If Mount Edith Cavell was this steep (as we had heard from other hostellers), we didn't want any part of it today.  We decided to hike up Whistler's Mountain and return on the skytram instead.  We were told this would take us about three hours. We started up, as we had a lot of time on our hands.  The first part proved to be quite easy, with relatively good trails up the mountain in a series of switchbacks.  Gradually it got steeper.  At no point were we discouraged however, as we passed a few families with very young children climbing up today. It was about 27C when we left the hostel, and I was sweating profusely.  My t-shirt was completely soaked with sweat, and the single water bottle I had was starting to run low.  As we climbed, the tall alpine gave way to smaller and smaller trees, and finally just rocks.  It looked like the moon, and the crisp atmosphere made things even more surreal.  We reached the top in 2 hours and 35 minutes.  Not a record by any stretch of the imagination, but a good effort for the over the forty crowd. Paul and I continued to the summit, about another 800 feet in elevation.  It offered some spectacular views, including one of my coveted mountain - Edith Cavell!  Our adventure was almost over.  We made our way back down to the tram, paid our $11.00, and were whisked back down in a matter of minutes. At the hostel, I prepared the grossest meal I have had to eat in a long time.  It consisted of a mix of two different "add water and eat" dishes.  Tom had his plate completely cleaned off by the time I sat down to eat.  I stomached my way through about one-half of my plate, before I chucked the rest in the garbage.  I don't think Paul made it that far.  Tom still claims to this day that he ate everything on his plate.  Damn, that boy must have been really, really hungry!!! Sleep came early that night, surrounded by about 50 other bodies in the same common sleeping area.  But it ended rudely at about 5:00 a.m., as we had to get ready to leave.The Sun Dog Tours van showed up almost on schedule at 6:00 a.m.  After a bit of seat moving, we managed to fit the bikes and luggage in the van, and we were off for the Calgary airport.  Along the way, our eagle-eyed driver pointed out about 40 elk, and one bull moose along the highway.  We still did not see any bears.  The five hour drive kind of trivialized our six days of bike riding, but I don't think you can ever truly enjoy the vistas the way we saw them from the back seat of a steel cube moving at 100 kph!                 
(click to show email) ?The Natchez Trace may well be the most historic roadway in North America. First appearing over 8,000 years ago as a buffalo and Indian Trail, eventually the path knew the wagon wheels and horses? hooves of the expedition led by explorer Hernando DeSoto, in search for gold, around 1540?. (Mississippi 2002 The Official Tour Guide. P. 43)
We arrived in Natchez about 7:00 pm. We drove to the visitor?s center but it was closed. We did drive over the Mississippi River into Louisiana to say we had made it over there. The river seemed to be up and had a very muddy look probably from the floods that are happening in Illinois and Missouri. We then went to the Natchez Trace State Park where we camped. It was a nice campground and had plenty of spaces available. There was a bathhouse although we never showered. Our plan of riding was to have two bicycles riding while the third person drove the van 20 miles up the Trace. The driver would then park the van at a designated spot taking their bicycle off the van and riding back down the Trace. When the bike that left the van caught up with the other two bikers coming up, he would join them to ride back to the van. Once at the van another driver would take the van up the Trace another 20 miles. This was the method we used to insure that each rider got in about the same amount of miles. 
We stopped in Sunken Trace and toured it. There was an old graveyard there with many dead Pattersons. We stopped at the Lower Choctaw boundary. There was a line of trees that had demarked the end of the Choctaw lands. The trees are still standing. It is now the boundary between two counties. We discovered that the Trace as one of the last places for settlers who were heading west. The last place to get provisions before they left civilization as they headed for new settlements. Soldiers constructed the Trace in the early 1800?s -1801. The area was where a Civil War Battle of Raymond was fought. General Grant latter made his headquarters on the Trace.  At this point on the Trace we were only about 35-40 miles from Vicksburg. Jim left the van at Deans Stand---the outpost that this man had set up where he sold provisions to travelers, itinerate ministers, vagabonds and settlers. We went 66 miles in 5 hours 30 minutes of riding the bike. We arrived at our second campsite Rocky Springs. The National Park Service operates it. There is a small building that has restrooms and literature on the area as you enter the park. There is a pay phone there but someone took the receiver so it was of little value in my need to let the family know I was ok. Jim?s cell phone would not work here either. This is a nice park but it has minimal services. I was really hoping for a shower but all it had was a sink and flush toilets. There were plenty of campsites available and Jim selected one for us before Bob and I got there. (We later rode 20 more miles up to Deans Stand, which is where we will start on Tuesday). There are several people in big huge camper vans with cars in tow. The one from across the street came to tell Jim and Bob (I was reading in the tent) that he was retired from General Motors. He talked in a big booming voice, I guess he was used to talking loudly and distinctly over machines for 30 years. He does not like to see retired people walking in Malls and meeting for coffee. No sir, not him. He drives all over the country and is enjoying himself. He had a lady friend who he broke up with last year because all she wants to do is sit at home. So this happy retired man with his little Chihuahua dog walked gleefully to the rest rooms. He was pretty large, shirtless and hairless with just a pair of shorts on and flip-flops. Before he left my earshot he told the doggy that he was a ?good boy, are real good boy?. Lucky dog. I am a bit sore from this first day of riding but it has been a beautiful day. The temperature was in the 70s with an occasional head wind but it did not persist. The Trace is so beautiful and unspoiled. It is well kept being well mowed and clean. The road is a bit windy but mostly it is flat with a wide mowed tract on either side of the road. The trees are large and the forest is very dense on either side of the road. Mostly as we rode we are unmolested with traffic. It did seem that the traffic was more constant in the early morning and then picking up around 4:30PM. But all in all we were alone with the Trace. We did meet another biker at Mangum Mound. He was riding a Navallo bike that is sold by REI. He was complete in their clothing and matching two bags on his front tire and then two bags on his back wheel. He was on a 16-day ride from Murphy, NC to Baton Rouge LA. He was going to go there and then return riding by himself. He was very thin, almost emaciated and very happy to see us. We talked with him for a few minutes and then we were off again. He was not tenting as he said he was ?credit-card camping? staying in a hotel every night.  We talked with the Park Ranger at Natchez State Park on our first night. He was from Peoria Illinois but was raised in Mississippi. He took our ten dollars for the site and he talked with us for about 20 minutes. After the ranger left a couple from a camper across the road came over to talk with us. They were interested in the recumbent bikes. He had to comment on them then he made Jim a bit angry because he did not understand why bike riders did not ride on the left side of the road like walkers. We explained that it was the law and safer to ride with the traffic. He then said that if he drove buy us and we fell in front of him while he was driving it would be his fault. He would never ride a bike on the road, under any circumstances. He would only ride a motorcycle. I am trying to eat right on this trip so here is a run down of the food for the first day. I had a spinach, Swiss cheese and mushroom omelet for breakfast. I had a few almonds in the morning. For lunch I had several slices of Swiss cheese wrapped in turkey. I also had some dried fruit. For supper I made a pan of tofu with cabbage, green peppers, and onion. I had a large tasty pear for desert with my cup of decaf coffee. Jim and Bob ate different foods from me as they are eating more canned goods. I am the only one that had a cooler with food in it. 
I spotted several birds of prey flying on their early morning hunt. At one point along the road I saw several deer standing on the side of the road. They were looking straight back at my van as it approached. I thought at first that they looked just like the kind of deer that people buy to set in their yards. But then I realized that they were live deer. I slowed the van (the maximum speed on the Trace is 50 and I was going that speed). Just as I slowed, deer closest to the road broke and ran. In a few short seconds that it took for the van to pass, I noticed five white tails disappear into the woods. The Trace is literally covered with trees on either side of it. Although the sides of the road have big spaces that are approximately 100 to 200 yards on either side of the road, there are trees that block out all vision from anywhere else. It as if I ride my bike in a grand park that stretches for 400 miles. The tidiness of the parkway impresses me daily. The grass is all trimmed and the hundreds of trees are all manicured as if this were designated as some palatial gardens of kings. I have walked in the gardens of kings in England, China, India and Africa but nothing compares to the expanse of beauty of the Trace.  Just after seeing the five deer, I encountered a large dead doe in the middle of the road. It had been killed recently as the body was still oozing of blood. I had to wonder if the five deer were not looking for their lost brethren who was lying dead so near.  A short time later as I pulled the van in a pull off near mile 86 that I noticed a dead hawk in the middle of the road. Why that would happen is beyond me. I guess that living in the United States I expect to see deer dead on the road. They are allowed to over breed and naturally run from place to place especially at night when car lights blind them and drivers are not left with options. They are a real nuisance but to see a dead bird of prey in the middle of road is hard to understand. I pulled the van into the wayside and pulled my bike off to meet my fellow bikers. I had only gone 5 miles and they meet me. They had been riding a bit fast. We rode back to mile 82 and Jim decided that he would go get the van and meet us as we meandered our way through and around Jackson. The Trace is being reconstructed around Jackson; the detour for bikes is 23 miles. It takes the biker through Clinton and Ridgeland before coming back onto the Trace. Just before we took this journey off the Trace, another through biker that Jim had met the night before at Rocky Springs joined us. His name was Gary and he was riding from Natchez to Chicago (Naperville). He had the map also so Bob and I decided to go with him and we would stop at the first breakfast place we could find. It was a winding road but yet the directions were quite clear and we ended up at a Sonic Drive in for breakfast at about 10 AM.  Gary was from Illinois who had two daughters who were music majors from the University of Illinois. He used to ride his bike down to visit them. It was only a 110-mile trip. He and his 23-year-old daughter rode from Illinois to Vermont last year. He was a French major in college but did not want to teach French so he joined the Peace Corp and spent 2 years in Tunisia. He later got into computers and now at 53 is retired. His wife will retire in 2 years and then he is out of Naperville. It stuck me that I am the same age as he but I do not plan to retire until I am 70. Is it because I have a young family that I desire to work or is it that I like my work? What about him was he happy to retire or was he forced out? This is hard to say from our brief encounter. He seemed happy enough to be riding his bike and enjoying life. I wish him well.  He was a fast rider and we followed him for a good while but I knew that he was being held back. We had come up to a train crossing with a train blocking the road. Rather than wait we took off for 2 miles down the road to get around the stopped train when we got to the road a passenger train sped by us. Gary said that was the train he had ridden to get to the Trace. The freight train was waiting for it and so should have we waited and saved ourselves some time. We actually spent more time trying to find our way back to the map.Bob and I did get lost a bit and it took us longer to get back on the Trace than we had expected. When we did Jim said that Gary had passed him saying that he also got lost. That last two entries on the map needs to be changed. Bob was stopped by a woman just before the entrance to the Trace in Jackson. She was excited about his recumbent bike. They talked for 10-15 minutes about the bike and how it was good for someone like her who had back problems. Those recumbent bikes make people ask questions and want to know more about the bike. Jim met us almost immediately when we got back on the Trace. The ride around Jackson and Clinton was exhausting because the directions were well described but the last two items did not tell us where to turn. On a bike, a missed turn can mean lots of extra work, which it did for Bob and me. We figured that we rode about 4 miles out of way just to find Highway 51 and the entrance to the Trace.  We stopped by an overview of the lake and talked with a guy who had a dog. He said that the dog had found him by showing up at his workplace. The dog was part Chow and something else! It was a beautiful dog (remember that I am not much of a dog lover so this animal was impressive). To me it looked like a pup but was actually 3 years old. The dog owner was perturbed with all the people letting their dogs run free when they should be on a lease. I had to agree with him. (People who treat their dogs as if they were humans perpetually disturb me.) Dogs have a place but they need bounds. The dog owner and I agreed on that. He was a pleasant man who willingly took pictures of the three of us with my camera. Later I would wonder what this man?s occupation was. Standing there looking out at the beautiful lake with people walking back and forth, I thought this could be any exotic resort in the world. But here it is a part of the Trace. The water was spectacular and the view was awe-inspiring. Boats drifted or flashed across the scene. The shores of the other side of the lake exposed a great expanse of tress that makes the Trace. Trees are everywhere manicured and sculptured into a 400-mile garden. I rode on from the picnic area up the road that meandered around the lake. It was as if I was riding a bike down the Pacific Highway except the pristine view makes it the natural beauty of the Trace. I felt clean and alive as I rode those miles but knew that the road would lead me away from this gorgeous body of water. Yet I peddled on. At one juncture, there was a man on the other side of the road moving dirt with an earthmoving tractor. As I passed the earthmover there was one man sitting in a car and one sitting on the car. The man sitting on the car yelled ?Where you going?? I stopped and chatted with him for a few minutes. He was watching the man using the earthmover. He said that his job and the other guy in the car were to watch the guy on the earthmover. They worked for the earthmover. They were both African-American and the earthmover man was white. I wondered how much they were paid to watch that man. I felt I was missing something about Mississippi in that conversation.  They asked me where I was from and I told them the Appalachian Mountains of Virginia. I said it was pretty much nowhere (rural, unpopulated, beautiful) and the man sitting on the car said well that is what he tells people about this part of Mississippi.  As I rode off I thought that they were near Jackson and this was a big city, now why would he think he is from now where America? Perhaps people never see the beauty of their home area.  I rode for several miles with trees on one side of the road and water on the other side. Many people were fishing. People drive their car and trucks to the shore to fish. When people looked up to see the passing bicycle the hands immediately went to waving. I waved also as the friendliness of the Trace permeated me. I rode my bike to Ratliff Ferry where we camped for the night. It is a very redneck place with campers stuck next to each other like an unkempt yard. Not well kept with tall grass that needed to be cut. But this private campground did have a shower that was great with lots of hot water. There was no pay phone but the young man in the camp store said that I could use his store phone to make a calling card call. My call to my wife did not go through but he said that I could come back later to use it, as the store was open until 7PM. I was impressed that he was young but yet there was another young man sitting in a chair talking with him. My experience has been that it was older men sitting talking to each other but here we had the makings of a new generation of stores-sitters.  Before I showered, I rode another 20 miles up the Trace. I was mileage accumulating. It had been a tiring day with going around Jackson so these 20 miles were serene and cool. They seemed to click off as I rode. I was relaxed and back at the campsite after 85 miles on the trace. I showered and went into my tent cocoon. 
We went to sleep or at least attempted to but there was continual noise. Mr. Tattoo was talking loudly to his friends who had shown up after dark. But near me (one site over) was a pop up camper. A monster that screamed sporadically during the night occupied it. Big Ohhhhs and Ahhhss but sounding so fearsome like he had been awakens from a very bad dream. Then there would be silence and I would sleep, I think. But then the sounds would occur. Thus we started off the day all a bit tired and distraught except for Jim who had slept in the van (as usual), he heard nothing.  We had read that there was a breakfast place nearby. It was only a few miles but in reality it was a gas station with a bit of food. Thus my hope of a nice omelet became a soggy sausage and cheese biscuit. I was relieved to see that there was a working phone. I had not been able to connect the night before because I knew they were at the ballpark. The store at Ratliff Ferry closed at 7PM so I was not able to try them. The breakfast was a wash but here it was 7:15 AM (8:15 eastern) so I was able to make a quick call connecting this time. All was well at my home; I would ride a bit more relaxed knowing that.  I dropped Jim and Bob off just above the Choctaw Boundary then I proceed to drive the van to Cole Creek. This whole region was the habitat of the Choctaw Indians. There are various demarcations noting where large trees marked their boundaries. Signs and historical markers discuss the connection with the Choctaws and the whites. It seems that more of the emphasis is on the white men who married the Choctaws or sold them goods. The Choctaw Chief Red Dog was the one who signed the treaty for the removal of the Choctaws from this region.  As I rode the bike back down the Trace, I meet Jim and Bob at the Kosciusko information center. This center had an interesting museum about this Polish man who came to the United States during the Revolutionary war at the age of 30. He came to help construct fortifications being a principle in the building of West Point. The museum host was Mr. Jackson, a 75-year-old Mississippian who had to make immediate comments about Yankees. Which Bob and Jim promptly told him that I was. He said they grew harvested cotton in the summer and Yankees in the winter. He was a jolly fellow who had to show us a century old newspaper with an advertisement for his family?s store. He offered us fresh water and a good trip. He also informed us that this town was the home of Oprah Winfrey but the host was more interested in talking about the Revolutionary War. He had really no comments on Oprah except to give us a brochure on her. I had noticed that the small white-framed church where Oprah attended is shown in the Mississippi Tourism magazine. Mr. Jackson directed us to a large restaurant that served both breakfast and lunch. We arrived as they were between setting-up for lunch but they told us to come in, as we wanted the salad bar. Belinda was our pretty waitress who brought us our drinks and kept us informed about when the next food was ready. We had the cold salad bar and then hot soup. We left there to make our journey farther north. Our next stop was at French Camp were a man had married a local Indian and became famous in the region. He was French. The little town has numerous buildings and exhibits for the public. It seemed to be an active little town making its glory off of the history of the region. We arrived at our campsite at Jeff Busby. It has a gas station with some food. The campsite is nice with a new restroom but no showers. It is free and well kept. We rested for an hour and then took off for our final twenty miles of the trace going to mile marker 214 at Line Creek. The last twenty miles were actually the best of the whole day as it was cool and pleasant. I did 71 miles today. At one point I stopped at a lay-by where a U Haul van was parked with it lights on and the door was open.  I had seen the lights through the trees for several miles. The driver was sitting there with his head back. I walked up to him to see if he was ok. He woke immediately and said he was just tired. I told him his lights were on and he said well God Bless You. His battery would have worn down and he would have been stuck. I had remembered seeing this same man at the Kosciusko museum. He had come up to the museum as we were leaving and I remembered he told Mr. Jackson that he was moving to Tupelo. It is a small world in this little populated state of Mississippi. 
We saw a coyote and a hen turkey in the morning. It is always nice to get on the trail earlier when the animals are out feeding. The air is so fresh and there was the periodic strong smell of pine. Later in the day strong beautiful smells of honeysuckle would pass my path. The smells would transport me as I thought about how many miles I had gone and how sore by butt was. Then I would drift on into some imaginary place as my legs went round and round. These kinds of moments make riding the Trace more enjoyable. This day I did discover that Line Creek was the boundary line between the Chickasaw and Choctaw Indians. It is now just a fact of history considering that all these Indians were removed. As one signpost noted that an Indian council house had once stood there: It is a memory of the Indians history with it only living on in the names of towns or counties in the region. That is all the Indians received for all their centuries of livelihood in the region. Along the Trace there are several turnouts that display Indian history. There are the mounds all along the Trace and The Chickasaw Village in Tupelo. The site has the original village laid out with paths for viewers to follow and read the descriptions of their history. I would say there is an attempt to depict the history and lifestyle of the Indians in these displays. However many of the signs on the turnouts seemed to describe the trials and tribulations of the settlers. The Trace was notoriously difficult to cross. It was built on ridges and attempted to avoid the valleys as much as possible. The settlers had to deal with the mud or the mosquitoes when they traveled. The Natchez Trace Visitor Center is in Tupelo. It is a modest building but well organized with displays and reading material. It reminded me of being in a library when I visited because it was so quiet and subdued. They offer a 12-minute video in their mini-studio. I watched it, as I needed some time to be off of my feet. The video is well done with pictures and history. The narrator is as "country "as they come to give the film its authenticity. Some things I learned was that Abe Lincoln?s father (Thomas) had been to the Trace. And Andrew Jackson honeymooned here. And Meriwether Lewis killed himself on the Trace. It was an important road before the white man but also important afterwards with Natchez at one time claiming to have the most millionaires in the country (that is why there are the beautiful ante-bellum homes there).  While at the visitor?s center, I was also able to copy down a few of the books on the Trace so the reader can consult more authoritative literature than these mere ramblings of a bike rider. I spoke with a couple of people at the visitor?s center. One gentleman who was a local commented on how lucky we were to have this kind of weather in May. In fact many people remarked about it being in the mid-70s in May. I loved it! I had asked him and several other people what the word ?TRACE? meant but no one could tell me. The film said that the whites used the word to describe the Native Americans who traversed the road. It was said that when the Chickasaw and Choctaw Indians traveled they did not leave a ?trace? from their movements. I had thought that perhaps trace had something to do with the type of paths that the buffalo left but my concept was wrong. However the buffalo were the first to make this path. They pounded it. Numerous makers point out where the original Trace was once located but now the road is straighter than the animal paths. The absence of the buffalo on the Trace was noticeable. After leaving the visitor?s center, I stopped at the Pharr mounds. Here I talked with a man who travels the Trace all the time. He loves to drive it as he has family in Natchez but he is from Tennessee. We watched as local farmers harvested big rolls of hay. He talked about hay, tractors, Russians, chickens and the free market economy. He is a cost accountant, farmer and auctioneer. He was most comfortable talking with me, a global sociologist. I think the Trace brings together people to just talk and share as we did.  After leaving there I drove for a short while and then I was meet by Jim and Bob. They reported that no campsites were available so we had to drive up to a bike campsite at Colbert Ferry. This is in Alabama near the Tennessee River. It was a very primitive and secluded campsite that was crawling with poison ivy. I am hopeful that I do not get any although I was very careful. Jim wanted to go out to eat so we took off for Florence and ate in a small town caf that was serving the locals. The food was not good as it was but it was a break from the bike. We then drove to the Winn Dixie to get some more camping food and we were back at Colbert Ferry at nightfall. Then I was off to bed in my tent. 
Then I was scheduled to drive. But before we all left for the Trace, we took a road down to the river where there was a boat ramp. As we rode down there three deer darted in front of Bob and I. The fishermen were putting in their boats and heading out to mid-river. It was fresh and clean here at the dock. The fishermen were efficiently putting in their boats with outboard motors. I stood watching the fishermen put their boats in the river with the Tennessee River Bridge as the backdrop of it. The view was immense. Large boats becoming mere specs in relation to the bridge.  There were numerous geese with goslings strolling in the early morning mist. Geese are a bit too arrogant for me. I will not feed them as so many tourists do. I do believe that is why geese are all over this country: people over feed them and so they stay.  They are not stupid but they can be demanding. I drove the van over to the turn out across the bridge at Lauderdale. Here I parked it and took my bike over the bridge. I meet Jim and Bob about midway. We took pictures of each other and of the river. The boatmen all seemed to congregate in the middle of the river. I wondered who set the idea for which place to begin to fish. I drove back to the bottom of the bridge and then turned around. As I was riding back up I saw a few pennies on the ground. I stopped to pick them up and before I got to the other side of the bridge I had found 10 bridge pennies. I was ecstatic. As a bike rider, I often am speeding by when I see a coin on the ground however when I can I always pick them up. My old Chinese teacher Chiang Laoshi had said that if you do not pick up the pennies then that mean you do not want money. Bad luck I guess. I put ten pennies in my bike pouch. I drove to Steelwater Branch and parked the van. This was 35 miles from leaving Jim and Bob. Just as I was ready to ride another bike rider came in to the turn out. It was Frank and we rode for 15 miles together. He was born in 1944 and said he did not ride much. He had never ridden over 45 miles but today he was going to try to do 50 miles. I told him about what we were doing, not to brag to but let him know that I was riding with guys a lot older than him. We rode together and then I got ahead of him but he later caught up with me. I introduced him to Jim and Bob when we meet and then he was off. I am sure that native Huntsville guy will be riding more in the future. When I told him my name was John then he told me about his family having children named John and he has a son with that name. His name Frank was also a family name. He was named for a cousin who was fighting in World War II and the family feared he would not return so he got the name Frank. Well cousin Frank came back got married and named his first son ?Frank?. And so the story goes.  It is interesting the things that people tell us and the things we tell prefect strangers. It was nice to have a riding partner who was new and had interesting things to say. I never asked his occupation.  However, I encouraged him to ride just a little every now and then because it is fun but no hobby should be a chore. When I was riding back to Sweetwater branch I passed a Tom Turkey running across the road. He took flight and then ran fast off into the woods. A beautiful bird it was. It made me appreciate Benjamin Franklin?s desire to have it as the national bird of the United States. The bird and the smell of honeysuckle made me think of all the history that I had been seen here on the Trace. We camped at Meriwether Lewis campground. The Meriwhether Lewis campsite is excellent. It is a primitive campsite with flush toilets and water. No showers. The camping area is about one and half miles from the Trace. It is a long winding road but it takes you to a very nice camp area. It was Memorial Weekend so there were many tents and campers at the site. This was another primitive campground. I am beginning to feel a bit smelly to myself. I am writing now in the campground. A motorcycle pulling a trailer just came by. The driver was a big man with a big woman sitting behind him holding a big coke and smoking a cigarette. Only in America. I should mention that as we travel the people riding motorcycles are very friendly. They almost always wave to us and of course they are able to pass us easily. The campers and big mobile home travelers are fast and trucks pulling trailers can be fearsome. We did 15 more miles this evening and then we will have 40 miles in the morning.  When I got back to the park (this truly is a park for you could tour and visit without ever knowing there was a camping area), I went to the Meriwether Lewis memorial. It is a simple and beautiful monument to this great man who died at his own hands in a fit of melancholy. The monument and the language written on it moved me. I prayed for understanding as I stood alone with helmeted head in bike clothes in front of this American hero?s ashes. He did not know his own greatness nor do many of us. There I stood alone also in this immense area with a manicured lawn and circular pavement. I stood there with no other human being or the sound of one. I was alone with Meriwether  Lewis. The Trace offers so many of these moments to be alone with history as you silently pass it by. I got back on my bike to ride to the site where the cabin had been where Lewis had died. I went into the small exhibit building to look at the history of the place. My most interesting concern was the guest book. Here were names of people from Australia, New Zealand, England, Illinois, Wisconsin and everywhere. They commented on the serenity of this park, the numerous wild turkeys, the history of the region and the beauty. After leaving there I used the pay phone to call my wife and family. There was so much emotion of the Trace that I could not describe but yet to say that I had to bring them here to experience the complex beauty of the region. 
Well it got us up early. We were packed and leaving at 6:45 AM. I liked getting out on the Trace early. We saw many turkeys that morning. The lay of the land also changed. It was much more rolling hills now. Some places it seemed as if we should be going down when in fact the road was going up. The road was good here in Tennessee. It is asphalt and that makes it so much easier to ride. The rock and gravel are hard for peddling. We continued our tag-driving this morning as we had done. Jim dropped us off so Bob and I began the ride this morning. I soon lagged behind him so I essentially rode alone this last morning. Jim took off after 20 miles so I rode 41 miles to the terminus of the Trace. This day brought out the most bicycle riders we had seen since being on the Trace. We were headed north and the riders were all headed south. It must have been the Nashville crowd out for a Saturday drive. Many of them were looking pretty severe as they rode. It seems like ?through? riders are a bit friendlier and will stop to talk. Mind you, I encountered three of those people in the 400 plus ride on the Trace. When I got to the terminus, there were two women there. We talked about the Trace. One was an elementary school teacher and the other one was a former teacher from Kansas. What was ironic is that one of the teachers is married to a man from a town just near me in southwest Virginia. In fact, she only lives 60 miles from me now. Here she was on the Trace. This meeting of these women confirmed to me that I was meant to be there. We exchanged picture taking. And when Jim and Bob came, we all had stories to tell each other. I rode 423 miles on the Trace. I loved it. I want to return.

Sandy is a physical education teacher, president of the PBA and the youngest of the group.  Ron is retired Army and currently works at HDK Bicycles.  We all depend upon his expertese and equipment.  I am retired Air Force and a teacher of eighth grade physical science and math.  Bob provides SAG support and will attempt to ride 10 to 20 miles/day.  Sandy, Bob and I all ride Trek 520 touring bicycles while Ron relaxes on his Rans recumbent.  He gets all of the attention, especially from ladies at service stations.   
We took eight days to complete the ride some were rainy, some cool and each was enjoyable.  We climbed hills followed rivers, met some wonderful people and learned about Virginia through the historical markers.  The worst part of the trip was when we were packing up to return home. Bob, Ron and Sandy are departing from Newport News for Florence, Oregon on June 7.  I have some commitments and will fly into Eugene on June 12.  The great adventure will start from Florence as soon as the drivers arrive.  We will update the page periodically as Internet access is available.   
The official departure time was 5:20 and we stayed at the RV Park in Mapleton. We had a wonderful quiet evening camping by the river. Dinner was steak at Frank?s Diner and Lounge.  We arrived after the dining room had closed but Frank, the owner and cook, came to our rescue and provided a wonderful meal.     
  
The car needed a new heater core.   The people that serviced it for me went out of their way to get it done and us on our way.  Tomorrow we climb Santium Pass elevation 4817.  We have about 30 miles to the pass then 16 into Sisters, where we will spend the night and do some laundry.  This route is the alternate since McKenzie Pass is closed until July 4.   
      
  
I learned that bikers need to make an addition to Newton?s 1st Law which states, ?For every action there is an equal and opposite reaction?.   An example might be that a biker sits on the bike seat with a certain pressure and the seat exerts an equal but opposite pressure on the posterior.  Bikers might add that the slower one goes the more the seat exerts a pressure on the bikers posterior.  I know this to be true because my posterior became very tired as we climbed at 4 to 6 mph.  It does not get tired going down hill at 35 to 40 mph.   The summer reading program is progressing well. I finished Rise to Rebellion by Jeff Shaara.  I have read all of his books and greatly enjoy the way he brings American History to life.  This novel is about the events leading to our Declaration of Independence.  John Adams, Sam Adams, and Ben Franklin have taken on new life for me.  I also enjoyed Abigail Adams comments about coffee as I also am not a fan of coffee.   The next book is The Physics of Star Trek
This was a pretty easy day.  We started by diving off of Ochoco Pass descending to about 2500 followed by a climb to 4350 to cross Keys Creek Pass, followed by about 34 miles of down hill into Dayville.  We had breakfast in Mitchell at the Little Pine Cafe.  Marjorie the waitress and cook did a great job at the Caf in the center of town.  Ron had the biscuits and gravy; it was enough for 2.  The breakfast burrito is also very good.  Very interesting town.  I really enjoyed the juniper furniture factory at the west end of town.  While at the caf we saw Ralph and Janet, who were on their way to Missoula.  They were also planning to stay in Dayville but at a bed and breakfast. Dayville is a milestone because we stayed at a church on South Fork Rd.  This is our first chance for a shower since Thursday.  This is really a great service for bikers.  We had lunch at the caf in Dayville and went to the John Day Visitor?s Center to learn about fossils.  There we met a teacher from Hampton who was working for the Forrest Service as a part of their summer program.   While Sandy and I were visiting the visitors center, Ron and Bob met the girl who was our server at the caf.  She was unable to get her car to run when she stepped on the gas.  A check under the hood revealed that the key had broken which connected the throttle to the carburetor was broken.  A little bailing wire and she was on the road again.   The John Day National Monument was named after a person who delivered mail and was robbed by the indians.  They took his mail and his cloths         
The descent from Dixie Pass to Austin Junction was a great way to end the day.  We stayed behind the Austin House for no cost.  The food is excellent and the owners, Jeff and Christy Keffer, consented to open early to provide us breakfast.  You might want to try the berry of the forrest pie. I finished The Physics of Star Trek; it was an easy read with many interesting excerpts from the show.  I learned many interesting facts about Light and Space, which can be related in the classroom.  We may even watch Star Trek in class one day.  I am starting In Harm?s Way.  I feel the need for a little excitement.  Bicycling is great for the summer reading program.  I have not watched TV for over a week.  Tomorrow we go to Baker City.   
Once out of the hills the more gradual descent was offset by the head winds and gusts.  Sandy and I stopped by the Sumpter Valley Railroad recreation and enjoyed the park. In town we visited the US Bank where they have a gold nugget weighting 80oz.  This area yeilded more than $10,000,000 prior to the termination of excavation in 1956.  We are still talking and having fun.       
You are following the Powder River.  During the ride I heard fish jump and saw a fisherman land a nice sized one.  The climb over the 3,653 seemed quite steep.  We stopped and visited Halfway, the first Dot.com City; they were preparing for a rodeo on the 22 and 23.  While in Halfway , I bought a puit.A puit looks and  tastes like a pear.  The ride from Halfway to Pine Creek was pretty much down hill, just what we needed as the sun came out and it became quite warm.  We spent the night in a trailer at the in Pine Creek.  Tomorrow we will enter Idaho.  We sure will miss no sales tax.     
  
  
  
We departed Grangeville at 5:38 because Ron got us up early. He was still on Mountain Time.  The Lion?s Club Park is a great place to stay.  We watched little league baseball and girls baseball.  We also were able to listen to kids play basketball and blast music until after 10:00.  Be sure to let the police know that you are there because they will patrol the area more and leave the restrooms unlocked. The departure from Grangeville was a pleasant surprise as we descended about 1300 feet very rapidly almost like a roller coaster.  There was little traffic so we were free to fly.  The downhill continued all of the way to Lowell.  The Luchsa River Valley is a knockout.  White water rapids and steep hills all very green.  Sandy had a deer jump in  front of her today.  There is no place to eat in Stites; the two cafes are closed.  We stopped just west of town and watched the activities of a lumber processing plant.  Along the way we traveled through the Nez Perce Indian Reservation and learned about the battles and movements of the tribe.  The caf in Koskia, where we stopped, served Bison and Yak. We decided that the water in the river looked inviting especially since the temp was pushing 90.  A walk in the river proved that it was quite cold.  I also almost stepped on a snake while taking my dip. There is very little in Lowell, a small store and caf.  These are the only services for 66 miles.  We rode Split Creek Bridge but stayed at the Apgar Campgrounds annotated on the map, 7 miles east of Lowell.  The temp was to be over 90 and tomorrow approaching 100.  It will be an early start to beat the heat. I finished reading I Harm?s Way.  It is a great book if you enjoy history.  It is the tale of the cruiser Indianapolis that was sunk by a Japanese submarine.  The Indianapolis delivered one of the nuclear bombs, which were dropped on Japan to end the war.  The captain of the Indianapolis was court-martialed because his ship was sunk.  The book tells of the courage of the crew left to float in shark infested waters for 4 plus days.  The description of what happens to the body after one drinks seawater is eye opening.  The survivors fought for many years to overturn the injustice, which was done to their captain with little avail.  Then a middle school student in Florida was doing a history project and wrote to a Senator who took an interest in the case and eventually the ship?s captain was cleared of all wrong doing.  You never know what you can do until you try. I will now move back to the area of schoolwork and read Absolute Zero and the Conquest of Cold by Tom Shechtman.  Absolute Zero is always an interesting topic in 8th Physical Science.     
  
    

We stopped for lunch at the Lost Trail Hot Springs Resort and elected to stay due to the persistent rain.  The rain stopped about 3:30 so we started the climb to Lost Trail Pass.  This was a 6-mile climb gaining 1800 feet to an elevation 6995.  The climb was not bad, made easier because Ron had changed my granny gear from 30 to 28 teeth before he left.  Chief Joseph Pass (7241ft) was just a short climb further; there we crossed the continental divide.   The 11-mile down hill was great passing through unspoiled wilderness.  Total mileage toward completion was 55 miles.
We had breakfast in the land of 10 thousand haystacks.  We rode through some very nice scenery and had the chance to see lots of cows, deer, prong horn antelope and hawks.  We saw a hawk catch a prairie dog.  The lodge in the town of Jackson Hot Springs has some beautiful trophy heads on the walls.  In this area Lewis and Clark recorded, ?that a piece of meat about the size of three fingers cooked in 25 minutes.?  We also talked with a mother in the town who indicated that she liked the school system.  The town has a two room school for elementary through middle school.  The two teachers teach all approximately 25 children.  The high school kids are bussed to Dillon, which is about 40 miles away.   The climb after Jackson was rewarded with a descent approaching 50 miles per hour.  We enjoyed a visit to Bannack, which was the capitol of the Montana Territory.  I had a chance to pan for gold and had little luck.  I did get a collection of garnet.  Bannack is famous for Sheriff Henry Plummer, who was hanged by vigilantes.  He was convicted of causing the murders of about 104 people. I completed Absolute by Tom.  It was a history of the quest for cold.  The book went into how the thermometer and the scales we use to day were developed.  I covered much of competition between scientists and discussed superconductors.  There are several points that I will be able to use in my 8th grade physical science class.  For example how 32 degrees was designated the freezing point of water or for that mater how the increments named degrees. The video about Bannack tells how the people survived the winters.  It indicated that when people would awake in the morning that there would be frost on their pillows and bed cloths.
My current book selection is Under Siege by Stephen Coonts.  He is one of my favorite authors and I felt the desire for some adventure after learning about the quest for cold.   
We awoke refreshed after our night in the teepee.  It was 43 degrees for our departure for Cameron.  We had breakfast at the Star Bakery and Caf in Nevada City.  It was a nice rustic place with the restrooms out behind the caf.  We were early enough in Virginia City to be able to take some photos without lots of tourists around.   The climb out of town was about 3.5 miles and good test of our stamina.  The descent was tremendous.  We coasted 10 miles into Ennis.  We passed a couple heading up the hill and had pity on them.  Ennis is a nice town.  We watched horses walk down the main street.  I was especially impressed with the memorial that is being build for service men and women.  The have a wonderful stature of a cowboy with a helmet and paper in one hand and his cowboy hat placed over his heart with the other.  The plaque talks about the paper being his discharge papers or orders to duty.  The hat over the heart is in respect for the flag and those who have died defending it.  The large flag over the monument was being taken down because it had developed a tear due to the wind.  It was being replaced with one in proper shape. We rode in two parts today.  The first part was 45 miles and then 8 more after a rest.  We did not enjoy the head wind but thought that it would be nice not to over 60 miles to West Yellowstone on Wed. This trip is amazing, I have seen so much good and beauty that it is impossible to tell or remember all that transpires.     
  

    
      
  
The ride was through very sparsely populated arid land.  We had about a 1000-ft climb that seemed more difficult because you could see the road just go and go and go.  Along the way I saw a badger.  This is the first that I have ever seen in the wild, actually I thought that they were all in Wisconsin.  We also saw many antelope.   I often retreat into myself while riding sometimes doing math problems or thinking about family and home, today was no different.  While I was on one of these retreats, a RV coming towards us lost a wheel, which came bounding down the highway.  Sandy says that it bounced several feet in the air numerous times but I did not see it.  The wheel and tire eventually went off of the road.  A car tried to flag the guy down and we stopped to show the driver where his wheel had gone but he never returned.   We spent the night in the JS Motel in Jeffrey City.  There is a park that is free to campers but it is very primitive.  There is no water and latrine facilities are marginal.  The small motel has about a dozen rooms and most are filled with bikers such as we.  Jeffrey City is little more than a post office, caf and motel.  The town was founded in 1955 and grew up around a Uranium Mill, which has since closed.  I finished Under Siege by Stephen Coonts.  The book is an easy read very fast paced entertainment.  My next selection is Atom by Lawrence M. Krauss.  This book says that it is "A single Oxygen atom's odyssey from the Big Bang to life on Earth and beyond".  It should be useful in my Physical Science class.  The author also wrote "The Physics of Star Trek".

The terrain is severely flat.  We were able to make grate time but there is not a lot to see.  We stopped in Ordway and had breakfast.  I had a pancake sandwich.  A pancake sandwich is a ham and cheese omelet with pancakes above and below.  I was expecting something more like pigs in a blanket. I am still on the tour thanks to Joan.  I thank you all for your interest and time.  I am greatful to each and everyone of you. Please check back for photos as I am in the Tribune library and can not use disks with their computers.     
    
    

      
The wind was against us most of the day, blowing from the east at 10 to 15 mph.  Bob drove to Nickerson and rode his bike back toward us.  Along his ride a female biker asked him if he was a member of "3 Old Guys and a Gal".  Denise has been following our trip in the net as she is traveling and updating her site, Boston to Oregon: a cross-country celebration. which may be accessed by clicking on "Whats New?.  We had a nice visit, exchanged photos and admired her bike. She has a Bike Friday which folds and stores in the case she was pulling behind.  Great idea, she can check the luggage rather than paying the airlines to carry a bike.   We stopped in Buhler, Ks for a Coke break although most places have Pepsi in the West and Kansas is no different so far.  We went to a grocery store and sat on the benches outside to enjoy a few minutes off of the bike seat.  The people were the most friendly that we have met during the trip.  Everyone stopped to say hello, welcome to Buhler and wished us well.  Later Sandy and I took a break under a shade tree in a farmer's front yard.  He came out and sat on the ground and visited with us.  He also offered refreshment and restrooms but we just needed a seat break.  All in all today was a great experience in Jayhawk Country. We stayed a the campgrounds in Hesston. I finished "Fatal Voyage" by Kathy Reichs.  It is an interesting book about an airplane grash and how the NTSB investigates the cause and also how bodies are identified.  I especially liked the "Afterward".  It was an easy read. CHECK BACK FOR PHOTOS     
Yesterday we noticed some cornfields seemed to be eaten up.  The leaves were deformed and droopy.  Today we may have found th reason, grasshoppers.  Grasshopers were everywhere, we developed a game to see how many we could run over. Departing Cassoday we took the wrong road and ended up at the campground in El Dorado.  We had planned to stay at the campground but would have ridden the 9 miles off route in the van.  Now we must make up the milage tomorrow.  One consolation, by taking the  wrong road we avoided a 3 to 4 mile section of freshly laid tar.  Bob's bike was a mess after just one mile.  I must check the map more thoroughly next time.
We met two cyclists from the Netherlands.  They were riding from Miami to the West Coast.  One was a teacher.  He indicated that he was able to take the time to do the ride because teachers over 50 get one half day per week off.  He had accrued 3 months off and was using that plus his summer break for the trip.  He indicated that there was an extreme shortage of teachers in the Netherlands.  He attributed this to the fact that students are responsible for their own education and teachers function as coaches. We also saw a new critter crossing the road.  A skunk passed in front of us and we were sure to stop.  No need to make a tough day tougher. We stayed at the City Park in Chanute.   
We are camping again in a city park.  These towns really are great allowing we vagabonds to camp for free and use the pool facilities for showers.  We will be in Missouri tomorrow and expect to start climbing.  Those we have met say it is like a rollercoaster.  Lots of ups and downs.  We must be back in civilization as we have had Wal-Marts in the last three towns.
We awoke at 4:30 to get an early start before the 100 degree heat.  The ride to Golden City was much like Kansas, flat to slightly rolling.  Breakfast at Cooky's Cafe was great.  The place is known for its pies and is a must for bikers passing through.  The polish sausage and blueberry pancakes are a good choice for breakfast.  The prices are very reasonable.  They are not open on Mondays so plan accordingly. The terrain becomes much more rolling with a few pretty steep climbs after Pennsboro.  We are camping once again in the city park next to the pool.  The pool, showers and camping are free to bikers.  I believe this says something for the responsibility of the people who are biking cross-country.  All most every town we have passed through in the last few weeks has open parks and facilities for bikers. Biker Bob needs is quite the schmoozer.  When we get to town he knows everybody and everything.  He even scheduled internet time at the library for us.  The President could use him as an advance man.
We saw a fox this morning.  The night in Ash Grove City Park was not real restful.  A bird in the tree above us was talking all night.     
The ride today was great.  It was overcast with a slight tailwind.  The temperatures were in the 70s at noon.  We even got rained on a very little.  The hills had moderated and we made great time.  We stopped at a gas station/store in Bendavis.  The owner was very friendly and had a book for bikers to sign.  I asked the background on the name of the town.  She indicated that it was named after a stand of Bendavis Apples.  I did not know there was such a thing. We saw and unfortunate sight today.  A dead possum by the road with a live young next to it.   So far Missouri is not as bad as we have been told but the tough part is to come in the next few days.
We spent the night in Houston, Ks at the park.  We slept on the picnic tables under the pavilion rather than put up our tents.  Charlie and Carrie decided to continue on to Summersville, 22 mi, rather than stay in Houston.  They slept in rather than ride in the rain and met us in Eminence.  Carrie may less than her bicycle but she is part goat. She beat me up the hills and she was fully loaded.  They also continued on another 12 miles to Centerville rather than stay in Ellington.  We are spending the night at the park with a repeat of last nights sleeping arrangement.  The library in Ellington is getting internet access on August 1. I saved a turtle today and Sandy and I climbed a fire lookout tower.  That brings the total to four saved turtles.  The lookout station was closed when reached the top.  There is more to this trip than biking. Dan, my mascot, got wet for only the third time.     
The ride was very nice, rolling early and then flat by Missouri standards.  Only one or two major hills to climb. Our turtle saved count is now at 4. We are staying at the city park next to a minor league baseball park.  Hope there is a game tonight. Chance of rain so another night on the picnic tables. PHOTOS TO COME     
We took the levee route out of Chester, which was nice and flat.  It was nice cruising without traffic.  We elected to stop at Neunet and have Bob carry the remaining 15 miles into Murphysboro.  We were hot and tired and not having so we will enjoy the ride tomorrow. We stayed at a motel in town as did Charlie and Carrie. Illinois has been friendly so for but Missouri was a bear to the end. Last night Jessie showed up about dusk and spent the night in the park with us.  Today is his 23rd birthday.  He was going to make it a short day to celebrate.  I game him an MRE with pineapple pound cake for a birthday present.     
A little food improves the outlook and we continued to Tunnel Hill.  The terrain was rolling but not like prior to Goreville.  We returned to Goreville and stayed at the Ferne Clyffe State Park.  The park was very nice and the showers were great.  Unfortunately we did not have a pavilion and tables to sleep on.  We went in town and ate at the Late Bloomer Caf.  The service was great but the steak was not.
        
We planned to stay at the Elementary School Park, which has a nice pavilion with good looking picnic tables.  We were set to spend the remainder of a hot day in the shade of the pavilion.  Earlier however, Bob had been invited to a cook out at the Utica Baptist Church, which was just up the street from the park. Two smelly old guys and a gal showed up with hands out and were met by gracious people offering all types of good food and home made ice cream.  Needless to say, we felt compelled to partake of their offerings.   I'm not sure whether it was our sighs over the air conditioning, our many references to the heat or divine intervention that precipitated the invitation to stay in the sanctuary but we lost no time getting our things from the park and setting up in the church.  We were not alone because the parishioners left the remaining chips, soda, ice cream and sandwich materials for our midnight snack.  Move over Buhler, KS, Utica, Kentucky is now the friendliest place on our trip.  Thank you, Rev Everett Berry and the Utica Baptist Church for your wonderful hospitality.  Jessie showed up later sporting a new haircut.  Good to see the new 23 year old.       
  

We have set a time and place for our arrival home at Yorktown!  At the present time we plan to bike from Jamestown to Yorktown via the Colonial Parkway and arrive in front of the Duke of York Motel at the beach on Water Street between 8:30am and 9:30am on Tuesday, August 13! We would love to have you come and watch us come in or if you would like to bike with us on the last few miles Bob Flynn will meet you in front of the Duke of York Motel by 7:30am on Tuesday morning.  He will be leaving right at 7:30am to ride back toward Williamsburg to meet us on the Colonial Parkway. If you have questions please contact this web site.  Should there be a change it will be posted on the web site. Bike riders need to have helmets.
   While we were in town we visited Ft. Harrodsburg and learned that Daniel Boone lived here for a while.  They have a play nightly near the Fort.  It runs from 8:30PM to 11:00PM, which was to late for tired homewordly motivated cyclists.    The ride to Berea was not as bad as we expected.  Whe had some moderately steep climbs but nothing to stressful.  The cool weather definitely has made life easier on us.  The wind was not a factor today.  The ride out of Berea was very nice mostly downhill but on a very rough road.  It was nice to get off of 21 and onto 594.  Bikers really must be on their toes to keep track of the road changes on the route from Harrodsburg to Berea.    I finished reading "Ghost Soldiers" by Hampton Sides.  This is a very powerful account of the rescue of WWII POWs held in a prison camp in the Philippines.  Many of these prisoners were the last survivors of the Bataan Death March.  The book documents man's inhumanity to man and man's ability to withstand hardship.  I highly recommend the book and I believe that the History Channel has produced a documentary on this rescue.
We also had a chance to do a good deed (Boy Scouts) today.  A car had dropped its front tires into a ditch and we helped push it out. We took the Murphy's Ford Short-cut between 594 and 89.  This three mile single lane road cut off more than 10 miles of the route.  It is flat and I would recommend it.  The route had some pretty long climbs but not as bad as we expected and can in now way compare with Missouri.  Kentucky roads, thus far, follow the rivers; Missouri's seem to just go over the hills. We are spending the night at the Booneville Presbyterian Church. 
The first 23 miles to Chavies was tough.  We had some long climbs with several false summits.  Many times we thought we were at the top of the hill only to start climbing again.  We stopped for some gas station chicken in Chavies and met an interesting fellow.  He had recently returned from a trip to the Eastern Shore.  He had taken a 70+ year-old townsman to see the ocean.  The gas station had his picture at the ocean displayed.  It may have been his first time outside of Kentucky.  Chavies to highway 80 was flat to rolling but the climbs became pronounced on highway 80.  We exited 80 at Dwarf and followed the river into Hindman and on toward Pippa Passes.  The route was flat and very enjoyable.  Dogs were not a problem today, they seem to respond to a kind confident voice.     
The first 15 miles were along a drainage pattern and were flat and fast.  We had a pretty long and moderately steep climb in the area of Melvin.  The tough climb came prior to Lookout.  The road is very narrow with many washouts on the side.  The downhill is also a challenge because the road is very rough and with steep turns.  Sandy had a blow out going down this part of the route.  There is another moderate climb between Hiller and Ashcamp then the route resumes following the drainage and is flat.  The eight miles from Elkhorn City to Breaks Interstate Park was much easier than the climb up from the Virginia side.  We were really sweating the climb much as we had the climb up Hoosier Pass and were pleasantly surprised by both.    Dogs were not a problem.  We found if you talk to them they are much less threatening.  One dog was especially friendly, bouncing and playing around the bikes.  Sandy gave it some potato chips, which he ate with glee.  There were some dogs up on a hill that became interested in us but by the time they made it to the road we were long gone.  They just ran around chasing their tails. It only rained two days during the entire tour but today just as we arrived at Breaks Interstate Park it started to sprinkle and then pour.  We finished just in time, 4:13 in the afternoon.     

I found my cycling partner for this trip, Tom Jolliffe from within the ranks of the same cycle club that I ride with: the London Cycle Club. Tom would be in France with his wife for three weeks before flying out to meet me in Frankfurt for the start of our journey. We both had new touring bikes that we had purchased in the last year, however we decided to take our "trusty" old steeds instead. Mine was a four year old Cannondale H-400 hybrid, while Tom's was a five year old Raleigh hybrid. The real reason we took these bikes is that we wouldn't cry as much if the airlines damaged them in transit.  I like to try to cycle from beginning to end, with very little reliance on local sources of transport. While researching this trip, I tried to find out if it was possible to cycle directly from the Frankfurt Airport (one of the busiest in Europe) without being impaled on somebody's Volkswagen Jetta. Some of the people I corresponded with thought I was crazy: "German drivers are too aggressive," or, "... there are nothing but autobahns around the Frankfurt Airport." However, I had made up my mind to find out if this was true. I finally found a web site put up by an American cyclist, Boyd Simmons, who had done almost the same trip I had planned, only a year earlier. And he had cycled directly from the airport. This gave me a great deal of encouragement. However, Mr. Simmons did not include a whole lot of detail, so my quest continued. I came upon another web site specifically set up with information of cycle touring around the world, with emphasis on taking your bike on airplanes, etc. Through this web site I got in touch with David Alexander, a teacher from Alberta, Canada who had also cycled from Frankfurt Airport. With his detailed instructions, we found our way out of the airport with exceptional ease. His instructions are paraphrased in a link on Day 1 of our trip.  During our eight day cycle trip we discovered a few things:  1.First, pack light! I had intended to take only enough "stuff" to fill my two rear panniers, leaving the front ones empty for various purchases along the way. Unfortunately, I got a bit carried away, and filled them all to capacity. I found there were several items I really didn't need. For example - rain gear. I took rain pants as well as booties for my shoes. What I found is that I sweat more than the rain made me wet. So leave the rain pants and booties at home. Besides, after 8 hours in the rain, not much stays dry anyhow. I did see many locals riding with ponchos - these would seem to be cooler, and might not be a bad idea. The camera I took was my old reliable Canon A-1 - a great camera, but it weighs in at probably 3 pounds ... about 5% of the total weight of my panniers. Get smart, go out and buy a portable camera, or get a disposable one.  2.Put a green garbage bag inside each of your panniers, then put all of your carried items inside them. Pack your clothes in large freezer bags (Ziploc), then put the bags inside the garbage bag. I did this and even after riding through eight hours of rain, and plunging through some flooded cycle paths over 9" deep, everything remained perfectly dry.  3.Do install fenders on your bike! These things will not only prevent you from looking like a skunk with a big black stripe down your back, but if you ride in a group, your partner who is chasing your tail will thank you immensely. Unless, of course, he likes eating mud! In case you are wondering, no we didn't have them. And yes, we ate a lot of muck!  4.Interesting books for the trip: I like to have a bit of background about the country I am travelling in before I set out. I also like to have a look at the maps I need before I depart so I can plan the trip, and have an idea on how long the trip will take before I leave. That being said, I would recommend cycling shorter distances in Germany on a daily basis. Tom and I had several days over 100 km. long. While we enjoyed the cycling part, and relished the spectacular scenery enroute, we failed to really enjoy the towns we stayed in. Sometimes we found that we arrived at 6:00 p.m., ate dinner, had a few beers, and went to bed, only to do it all over again the next day. Remember, the Romantic Road is very historical in nature, and includes many sites that involve more than just a cursory glance. Take your time!!! Here are some of the books we used for this trip, and can recommend:  Europe by Bike -18 Tours Geared for Discovery, Karen and Terry Whitehill. Published by the Mountaineers, 1001 SW KlickitatWay, Suite 201, Seattle, Washington 98134.  Germany The Rough Guide, Gorden McLachlan. Published by Rough Guides Limited, 1 Mercer Street, London, U.K. WC2H 9QJ. Rough Guides on the Internet: http://www.roughguides.com  Maps: It was hard to find cycling specific maps for Germany prior to leaving Canada. I found that the Michelin series road maps were satisfactory for the most part, however they missed many of the cycle routes that cycle maps did include. Once in Germany almost without exception, every bookstore carried cycle touring maps. We even found them in gas stations as well as the Frankfurt Airport. They were very expensive, at about 11 DM for a map that would cover roughly two days worth of cycling, but they were well worth it.
By the time I arrived at the departure gate for the Frankfurt flight, there were no people left in the lounge. An agent asked me my last name, and proceeded to give me a boarding pass for the business class section. This doesn't happen on a frequent basis for us airline employees, so naturally I was rather elated! Then he spied my bike and box containing my panniers. He indicated that these would not arrive with me. Since it was senseless to start a bike journey without my bike, I elected to wait and take the later flight to Zurich. Here, I would transfer on to a Lufthansa flight to Frankfurt, arriving well ahead of my cycling partner, Tom Jolliffe, who would be arriving from Toulouse, France.  I carted my bicycle and other belongings down to the Zurich departure gate. I took the bike to the great personnel at special services, where I was told I would have to pay $65 to have the bike shipped. A new Air Canada policy (apparently valid even on overseas flights) dictates bicycles can no longer be considered as one piece of luggage. Through a bit of clever negotiating, the agent agreed to turn a blind eye.  Unfortunately, the Zurich flight started out late - once again Air Traffic Control. After we pushed off the gate, nearly an hour behind schedule, it turned very dark and ominous outside the aircraft. Due to thunderstorms in the Toronto area, the flight was delayed a further hour before it got airborne. I knew now that my connection to Frankfurt would be missed.  The rest of the flight was pretty much uneventful, however, I do not necessarily recommend the exit row on a long flight.  After many hours in the air at sub zero temperatures, the emergency exit doors become "cold soaked."  And sitting next to one for several hours can get pretty darn cold, even with two blankets. We arrived in Zurich about ten minutes after my flight was to leave for Frankfurt. I waited for the next flight, which would still put me into Frankfurt at the same time as Tom. For the honour of taking my bike with me I was to be charged 50 Swiss Francs, but because I was an airline employee, they reduced the fee by 50%. Some comments about the Zurich airport: there seems to be smoking everywhere, even though they boast over the P.A. system the Zurich is non-smoking airport. The washrooms were excellent, even the stalls are like walking into your own private room, with a full door to close behind you - and yes, they even have ashtrays in the stalls of this "non-smoking" airport. You can probably guess by my sarcasm that I am a non-smoker.  This flight was, yes, you guessed it ? late again. I arrived in Frankfurt at about 3:45 p.m. Tom's flight was also delayed, and I had time to set up my bike prior to meeting him. Tom showed up at approximately 4:35 p.m.  We put Tom's bike together and proceeded to cycle out of the airport using some excellent instructions given by David Alexander from Edmonton, Alberta. The time was 6:00 p.m., and the temperature was about 17C, in very light drizzle. After a "disorientation" tour of the town of Zeppelinheim, we finally made our way out of town via a "yellow" class road leading south - Highway B-44. We had actually gone by this road at least twice already, and thought it might lead to the "autobahn," as we were not yet familiar with the German road signs. We decided to investigate it on out third try because it was getting late, and the rain was also making us miserable at this point. After riding down the entrance ramp, I saw other cyclists using the road, so I knew it was O.K. for us. This night we stayed in the small town of Morfelden, about 20 km south of the Frankfurt Airport. The first two inns were booked, and we finally settled on what was the last room in town at Gasthaus Luleys. We had cycled 30.8 km in 1 hour and 53 minutes, for an average speed of 16.2 kph. Not bad when you consider the number of times we had to look at the map.  I now highly recommend a map holder that attaches to the handlebars.  That alone will save you several hours on a trip like this.  The 40 DM apiece for our accommodations included breakfast in the morning which included coffee, boiled eggs, and various breads and rolls with meat, cheese, and various jams. We also ate dinner here for 20 DM. I had wiener snitzel, french fries, vegetables, salad and a beer for only 20 DM (about $16 CAN).   
After Dieburg, we took Road 45 to Hochst. Hills entered the picture at this point, and continued the rest of the way to Eberbach. After each hill, however, there was always a descent. The hills did not seem very steep, but they were very long.  We ate lunch in the town of Michelstadt at an outdoor cafe opposite an old timbered building with a clock. After a little window shopping, and the purchase of a few postcards (which I am still looking for), we continued on our way.  Our maximum speed for the day (on the downhill of course) was 58.5 kph. We completed a total of 93 km in 4 hours and 31 minutes, for an average speed of 20.6 kph.  We spent the night in Eberbach, a town right on the River in another guesthouse: Gasthaus Gruner Baum.  Again, the cost was a reasonable 40 DM, and we even had a "garage" for our bikes!  Actually, they spent the evening in the well stocked wine cellar just outside the Gruner Baum.       
Today we had rain almost all day. As the day wore on, the rain seemed to increase in intensity. There were many hills on this day as well. In Bad Wimpfen, we decided not to go all the way into town because of the hills, and because this would be a very long day cycling as it was (yeah, I know - a feeble excuse). We stopped at the rail station - about halfway up the steep incline into the altstadt. Here, Tom ordered six of something neither one of us could make heads nor tails of, but we thought it sounded as if they were something like sausage. About ten minutes later the waitress arrived with Tom's order of six ? snails! Escargot is spelt "schnecken" in Deutsche!  Just after leaving Bad Wimpfen, and crossing the Neckar River, we encountered a long, steep hill that ended at the junction of a road near a churchyard. I made it up the hill first, and while waiting for Tom, started a conversation with a 62 year old German gentleman with a one-speed coaster bicycle. He commented on how he would love to travel to North America. After Tom made it up the hill, this man directed us to a cycle path that would take us all the way to Mockmuhl without the traffic of the main road. And it was paved most of the way! He would even lead us to the entrance. I wished we had met this cyclist prior to the long hill, as he lead us down once again. His rear tire wobbled visibly from side to side as we made the descent at speeds in excess of 45 kph. The cycle path lasted 24 km., following the twisting path of the Jagst River valley.  In Mockmuhl, we refueled on donut like pastries at a local bakery. The rest of the day was uneventful for the most part - just more rain! We got slightly "lost" in Dorzbach, where we left the Jagst River valley and headed up a long hill northeast towards Bad Mergentheim. The guidebook indicated the uphill would last about 8 km, followed by a long 6 km descent into the city. I did not seem to find it that long - perhaps 5 km, followed by a 6 km descent. In any event, it was nice to coast into town. Our total mileage for the day: 133.8 km in 6 hours, 53 minutes, for an average speed of 19.4 kph.  Bad Mergentheim was the birthplace of my German friend, Birgit (with whom we would be staying at the end of our trip).  She had asked if I could take a photograph of the hospital where she was born, as she had not been back "home" for many years.  Unfortunately, it was raining fairly hard, so we bypassed this opportunity without too much thought.  The first pension we checked out on the road into town, just after the hospital was full. We rode downtown where we were given directions to a local hotel. This hotel quoted us 148 DM for the night - a marked increase over what we were used to paying.  Sensing we did not want to spend quite that much money, the receptionist called around to a couple other hotels in the area, then redirected us to the Hotel Wolfgang.  This hotel was priced at 100 DM for the two of us, which included "fruhstuck," or breakfast. Hotel Wolfgang was very nice with big rooms. They also allowed us to store our bikes in their garage for the night.  For dinner we wandered down to the markplatz where there appeared to be a blood donor clinic in progress, with entertainment provided, as well as food and refreshments.  I considered giving a pint, but I wasn't quite sure how well I would perform on the bike for the next week.  I passed on this opportunity.  We found a very nice Greek restaurant right next door to all the festivities.  After the standard menu items, we once again indulged in that great German pastime - drinking beer.  Tom had pils, while I once again had weisenbier.     
We ate lunch in the medieval town of Rothenburg. Rothenburg is probably one of the most famous towns in Germany. Once again, in keeping with Germany tradition (as perceived by us cyclists), this town was found perched high above (well, several hundred feet, anyway) the River Tauber. Rothenburg initially had very prosperous times back in the medieval period. It was declared a Free Imperial City, but as it found itself cut off from major trading routes, it vegetated into a very provincial market town. In 1945 the town suffered some damage from American bombing, but due to the efforts of an American civilian, working with the US army, the town was spared further bombing. Rothenburg is one of the best preserved medieval cities in the world. Even today, its conservation policies are the strictest in Germany. Even McDonalds is obliged to carry on this tradition by displaying only a small steel sign and flag outside its entrance by the marktplatz. After a quick tour of the town, we once again departed for Dinkelsbuhl at 2:45 p.m. We arrived in Dinkelsbuhl at 5:45 p.m. As a festival was on - the beginning of the Whit Sunday and Whit Monday holiday, there were no rooms to be found. After calling about 12 different hotels, pensions, and zimmer freis, without success, we turned to plan "B." As Tom's knee was starting to bother him due to the constant hill climbing of the day, and because a cycle ride to the next "major town" would put us in the dark, we would take a bus to Nordlingen, about 30 km away and stay there for the night.  The bus ride took about 30 minutes, and cost 7.90 DM apiece, including our bikes. There were very few rooms to be had here as well. We were lucky enough to have the one hotel owner call about five different hotels before securing as a room close to the local McDonalds, and right next door to the Judenherberge (youth hostel). This was the Hotel Schutzenhof, just outside the city walls, and a relative bargain at 59 DM apiece, including breakfast. We were not about to argue. Today were very happy, as we did not get any rain, just twenty minutes of very light drizzle. Total mileage for the day: 103.5 km, in hours, minutes, for an average speed of 17 kph.  Nordlingen is a also a medieval city with a surviving wall surrounding it. During medieval times this wall provided protection for those living within. Nordlingen is built in the crater of a meteorite that crashed to earth many years ago. The Apollo astronauts trained here in Nordlingen. As a mark of their gratitude, they presented the city with a chunk of moonrock which is on display in one of the local museums. The fact that they are extremely proud of this chunk of rock was illustrated at dinner, when one of the local elders sat with us during our meal. His English was very limited, but was much more extensive than our German, but I think he mentioned that moon rock no less than 12 times over the course of two weisenbier.  I think in some ways that Nordlingen proves to be a better example of a medieval city than Rothenberg. For one thing, it has fewer tourists, so there are fewer people to interfere with you being a tourist. Because there are fewer people milling about, many of the ancient buildings are also easier to preserve.
Tom made it about 3 km before his knee started to give out. We went our "separate" ways at this point - him via train, me via bike. We agreed to meet in Dachau sometime on Wednesday, and stay in touch via my friends who lived near Munich. The first 16 km of the ride were very easy over flat terrain, and with a light wind. The weather was sunny now, with a temperature about 16 to 18 degrees. The hills started at this point, with the usual up, followed by down. Harburg, about 2/3 of the way along was a castle high in the hills. There were a few detours in town because of "hoch wasser" once again, and also because of a local church ceremony, so I had to walk the bike part of the way through town, and ride around some water donated by the Wornitz River. The bike path up to this point was very good, and paved the whole way. Afterwards, it turned into a muddy tractor path which I followed only because of other bike tire marks heading in the same direction. After two km of heavy slugging, mostly uphill, I turned around and headed for the road. There was one more hill to climb before town, followed by a 4 km descent. Donauworth initially seemed very big and spread out versus the usual compact German towns we were used to. I cycled through the "downtown" area and the square (marktplatz) looking for zimmer frei or pensions, but could find none. So, I went to the bahnhof (train station) in search of a tourist information booth. Here I obtained a brochure listing the various accommodations for the town. I went outside to peruse it. While sitting down, I sensed someone looking over my shoulder. As I turned around, there stood Tom Jolliffe in all his glory! He had taken the train to Donauworth instead of Munich, and was willing to give it another shot.  We tried one pension, but it was full. We finally settled on the Gasthof Feurle - Ragusa. After a shower, we settled in a bit, then went for a beer, and a town tour. The Danube was very high, and many locals were out to view it. We ate dinner at the Gasthof. It was very good, and included a generous portion of salmon, broccoli, potatoes, salad and beer for 26 DM.  Total distance for the day: 38 km in 2 hours, 10 minutes, for an average speed of 17.5 kph.     
We walked down to the Marktplatz for dinner, Tom had stew and scalloped potatoes for dinner (20 DM), while I munched on a feast of sausage and sauerkraut (15 DM). We ate out in the open under beautiful sunshine. Oh - the wine with dinner was a nice touch. We also had a beer a bit later at a streetside caf. Total mileage for the day: 65.2 km in 3 hours, 22 minutes, for an average speed of 19.5 kph. Maximum speed today: 43.5 kph.       
The scenery today was mostly gently rolling countryside. Tom compared it appropriately enough to the countryside one would see around Guelph. For every hill going up, there was always a hill going down the other side, but these hills were not terribly steep. Along the way we passed a young fellow in a wheelchair modified into a bike that he pedaled with his arms. He seemed to keep up a respectable pace as well, even his seat looked more comfortable than ours?.  We found the information bureau just opposite the Rathaus in the altstadt area. They were very helpful (as always), and with their various brochures, we were able to find accommodations on one of the main streets - Mittermayer Strasse 15. The gasthaus was called, appropriately enough "Gasthaus - Fremdenzimmer Mittermayerhof. The price was once again 50 DM apiece.  After lunch at the hotel - pork roast with a big dumpling, salad, and of course, beer, we headed out for the concentration camp at the east end of town. We spent a few hours here touring and reflecting.  When we got back to the hotel, we walked downtown and toured the outside of the schloss Dachau (closed at this time). From the castle we had a reasonably good view of nearby Munich. Afterwards, we had a beer at an outdoor restaurant right beside the Rathaus. The beer ended up costing 27 DM apiece, because we also ordered soup (cream of asparagus - spargel) and salad. Then, the waiter talked us into delicious strudels to have with our cappuccinos.  We did a little window shopping, but decided the large screen TV (about 30") was too expensive, at 2600 DM. I used the bank machine here in Dachau (Deutches Bank) to withdraw another 400 DM for the remainder of my trip.  During the evening, some violent thunderstorms rolled through, but they did not last very long at all.         
Langenback is a small village (once again on the side of a shallow hill) just 10 kilometres east of Freising. We found ourselves maintaining speeds of 30 kilometres per hour as we approached the town. We found a phone booth down by the post office (next door to an excellent local bakery) in Langenbach and called Birgit. A few minutes later she was there to meet us with her three year old son, Benedict and take us to her apartment on Birkenstrasse (Birch Street).  The total for the day: 48.0 km in 2 hours, 4 minutes, for an average speed of 23.3 kph. Our cycling trip was now over. We had completed a total of 559.2 km in 29 hours and 17 minutes of cycling, for an average speed of 19.1 kph.       
Support freedom Many people decide to do long distance tours on bicycles, but it appears that not too many of them do it on three-wheeled bikes. When we decided to do this trip, we had just purhased new Novarro Touring bikes from REI.  Unfortunately, we were never able to get past the "wall" of uncomfortable bicycle-butt.  Added to this were shoulder, wrist, and arm pains that are associated with many long hours in the saddle. We had long considered recumbent bicycles for touring, but really had no experience with them.  We made a trip to a recumbent bike shop and test-rode several different models, both long wheel-based and short, over-seat steering and under.  The problem with recumbents is that since the center of gravity is different than on a regular wedgie, it takes some getting used to. We spoke to one of the workers at the shop about the kind of riding we were planning on doing, and he suggested that we try the Greenspeed Trikes.  We laughed!  They looked like wheel chairs to us.  He finally convinced us to at least give them a test-ride, but I assured him that we CERTAINLY were not going to buy one. After the test ride, we were sold.  The rest is history. Trikes are MUCH more comfortable to ride than upright bikes are.  The only drawback is that since you are pretty much lying down to ride, you can't stand on the pedals for power; it all comes from your legs, and that takes some conditioning.  Other than that, they're great!    If you take the time to read about the trip, please take the time to sign the Guestbook.  Thanks!
    We got everything loaded into the RV and Bill's sister Terri's Honda Passport and headed over to Mollie's Restaurant for the "Big Family Breakfast" of eggs, toast, fried potatoes, pancakes and bacon. It was enough for the 5 of us to have breakfast for 2 days! We had them package up the leftovers and we put it in the RV fridge. We were on the road by 9:30, with Bill's brother-in-law Frank driving our RV with Bill, Katie and Sammie aboard. Jan was with Terri in the Passport. The traffic through the LA area was heavy, but not stopped. We missed the turnoff for Malibu Creek State Park and ended up at Leo Carrillo State Beach Campground. We had planned on having Malibu as our starting point, as we had already done a lot of the route south of Malibu on day trips.  Also, since we were planning on tenting as much as possible, and tent spaces south of Malibu are few and far between, we felt this would be a good starting point.  It was packed, with no more RV parking, but the hiker/biker camp was open. Since we all wanted to camp together, we checked for the next available facility with open sites. It just happened to be Point Mugu Naval Air Weapons Station Recreation Area. It was right on the water. Katie and Frank headed to the beach, while Bill and Jan put the trikes together.  Terri and Jan picked up some drinks from the commissary, and Terri got lunch together for us all. And, of course, everyone had their turn on the trikes. Katie put over 9 miles on Bill's! Her legs didn't even bother her.     Our tent site was right across the street from the RV. Katie joined us in the tent when we went to bed. We were all really tired. But, before bedtime we had a big fire on the beach and ate 'smores while Frank played his guitar. It was fun. Right before going to bed, we noticed a bunch of sea lions had moved into the lagoon across from our tent site. It was pretty neat, but they made noise all night long.        

Don't miss the RV park life yet. We are still in campgrounds so it is still sort of the same. Just not RV Parks. Today we got to ride on the highway! Traffic whizzing by at 70MPH....Jan was a little frightened. We had a really wide shoulder though and most of the cars moved over anyway. Not everyone is an idiot I guess. As we were riding along the side of some big RVs one jerk in this huge bus RV blasted his air horn when we went by. We jumped, and blasted him right back with our air horns....surprised him!! 
     The camp host told her he would contact someone from the park staff.  The park superindentent came by a few minutes later and told us we would need to move, for our own safety. Since it was very early in the season, they weren't using the hiker/biker sites yet.  He told us that the restrooms were closed because some vandals had gotten in, and being cold, had started a fire in one of the trash cans.  That, in turn, set the whole restroom on fire.  He helped us move with his truck.  We ended up camped across the street from the family with the bus.  They are the Hanc's, Dave and Donna, and their kids, Jocelyn and Ryan.  Dave is a school teacher in Maine, and they are traveling around the country visiting other school districts, searching for ideas to take back to Maine.  They are going up to Alaska when they leave California. Dave is absolutely one of the most laid-back guys we have ever met.  He has the unique ability to find something positive in even the worst situations.  It's impossible to be around him and not be cheered up.  The name "HMMMM Bus" is derived from the humming sound you make when meditating.      After we got set-up the 2nd time we had dinner with them. We had minestrone soup and corn muffins with soda. It was delicious. We sat by a campfire afterwards. We finally got to bed at 9:30. We were tired.        
     One young girl painted a poem.  Jan painted a picture of our trike on the side of the HMMM Bus. It turned out pretty good!"    

  Travelled 13.66 miles to Gaviota State Park from El Capitan.  We had a 730 ft altitude gain.  The torque lever seems to have found the spot it likes, and has stopped moving.  Jan's bike seems to be working well enough with the broken parts disconnected.  We have tools and parts coming from Australia to Jean Anderson's house (a fellow Greenspeed Triker) in San Luis Obispo.  After getting our tent set up we spent quite some time swapping stories with the camp hosts, Jack and Jean Della Santa.  They are very nice.  They let us use their phone to check our e-mail and use their computer to update our website.  It was wonderful.  We also found that this campground has water and showers.  The ACA map said that they had neither, and we lugged quited a bit of water with us that we didn't need to!  The weather is wonderful.          

A little about Lompoc:  Confined to the coastal meadows by the elements, their diet and the grizzly bear, the first settlers of the area were simple food gatherers.  In the 1770's the Spanish discovered these lands inhabited by the Chumash Indians. Their diet consisted of mussels, abalone, crabs, lobsters, berries, sage and acorns.  They later moved inland where they subsisted on game and fish, as well as plant materials.  Like other California Indians, they lived in small, clan-like "triblets" with well-defined territories and separate dialects. The first European land expedition into California was lead by Gaspar de Portola, along with his contingent of Spanish and colonial soldiers, in 1769.  On December 8, 1787, the Franciscan Monk, Francis Lasuen, began the La Purisima Mission which began the Spanish and Mexican occupation of the valley, and the decline of the Chumash.  The Indians were baptized, offered beads, cloth and food and readily became part of the mission life, which they were forbidden to leave.  By 1804, 1,520 Chumash had been "converted" within La Purisima Mission.  By 1846, only 160 were left due to many diseases brought by the white man.      Show links to this Hide links to this      Colonel W.W. Hollister was one of the valley's first Anglo-American owners.  He headed west from Ohio with 200 head of cattle and later 900 sheep to build a fortune in 1851.  He became partners with Thomas and Albert Dibblee and acquired a chain of contiguous Mexican land grants, including Lompoc.  Here, vast herds of his sheep grazed before he sold part of his holdings to the Lompoc Valley Land Company in 1874.  The lands consisted of the Lompoc Rancho and the Mission Vieja de la Purisima Rancho.  The town was laid out nine miles from the coast, near the center of the Lompoc Valley.  The lots sold well and the town flourished. The Chumash Indians called the area "Lum Poc", meaning little lake or laguna, for a now vanished lake.  The Spanish called it "lumpoco" accenting the second syllable.  By the time settlers began to arrive in the valley, the name had been Anglicized.  The founding fathers of Lompoc modeled their city after Vineland, N.J., a thriving termperance community, and proposed that it be called New Vineland.  However, the citizens of Lompoc opposed the idea.  Another try in 1939 to change the name to La Purisima was also defeated. 1875 and 1876 were good years.  One of the worst droughts on record hit in 1877, however.  Sheep and cattle died and people were in need of food.  A diptheria epidemic broke out in 1878.  The valley recovered to become one of the most versatile agricultural locations in California, yielding vegetable, field, seed, nursery, livestock, fruit and nut crops.  In the late 1800's, rows of blue gum and cypress trees were planted to raise the temperature of the fields through windbreaks, which could increase the ground temperature by as much as 10 degrees.  Lompoc has now become known as the "Flower Seed Capital of the World". (Adapted from Lompoc: The first 100 years, published by the Lompoc Centennial Committee). We headed out of town towards Vandenburg AFB around 1 p.m.  It was a long trip because it was up and down hills and it was really windy. We have been out on our trip one week now.  Jan added up our found money for the past week and it added up to $3.16! Arrived at the Vandenburg Famcamp at around 4:30 p.m.  Got our tent set-up and then hung out in the nice camper's lounge.  We were able to watch TV even!  We were beat! Another 20 mile day up hill and into the wind. Just before dark we both felt the need to take a walk to Burger King.  We arrived there at 7:30 p.m. and it was already closed! We couldn't believe it, but remember, we are on a military base and it was Sunday.  The shoppette was right there so we went in there instead and picked up the needed snacks and sodas. It was a 3 mile walk round trip. Our legs were already getting stiff and the walk did us good.  It is quite cool and windy this evening.      Show links to this Hide links to this            

We will be heading out tomorrow.  We did some more paring down of stuff today.  Probably around 6 more lbs gone! Yeah, Rah!  We now only have three bags each.  One on each side of the rack and another on top of them.  With this set-up we should have less wind resistance.  We had another bag on top of all that, which we have now eliminated.  Prior to leaving on this trip, we constructed a "bear-proof" container out of 6" PVC, with a screw top, to store food in.  Very impractical, since it was very rigid, and served no other purpose.  If we have learned anything, it is this: everything you carry should serve several purposes. Our favorite bumper sticker that we have seen on this trip: "You can't see the forest for the fees". Pedaled 10 miles around the base.  Jan's knee is much better.  Went to the commissary to pick up some food for the next couple of days and to get cash. Took some pictures.  Several of a lady with a parrot on her shoulder and another of Jan next to a bright red mini car.     Looked a lot like the cars from East Germany before the wall came down. Did our laundry and got everything organized before heading out early tomorrow.        
There is a tent camper across the street from us who has two dogs and at least 12 cats.  We think she puts all the cats in a tent at night.  The dogs went into kennels. They also had a huge bonfire right behind their van. We thought for sure they were going to blow up their van. And then the train went by... Had supper and turned in for the night. 

   He transported us to the hospital.  After several hours of tests, the doctor decided that more tests were called for.  Thankfully, the Ranger returned to the hospital at midnight, took me back to the campground and waited while I did a quick job of taking down our tent and hastily packing everything up, and then transporting all of our stuff to a storage shed @ their office.  Mind you, this was all done after he went off duty.  He then drove me back to the hospital in his own car.  Way above and beyond the call of duty.  Thanks, Ray!    It appears that Jan is suffering from a kidney stone, and it will be a couple more hours until we know what will be happening.  At any rate, our trip is on hold until we know something.  I spent the night in the little chapel lounge usually reserved for families of critical patients.  Didn't get much sleep. Stay tuned for further developments... 

       We had a campfire and exchanged stories last night.  Cloudy and grey when we got up today, and then it began to rain.  Rained on and off all day, and remained very cool.  The campground here is packed.  We took a stroll out along the beach today and Jan picked up a sand dollar and gave it to Elisabeth.  Other than that, we spent most of the day relaxing in the warm tent.  Weather man is calling for heavy rain and strong winds tonight, and more rain tomorrow.  We are getting anxious to get back on the road again.  We have heard from a southbound rider that the road thru Big Sur is open again.  He was a young man we met here in the hiker/biker camp.  As he was leaving the park, he had a blow-out on his rear tire.  We stopped to help him repair his tire and he told us that he hadn't been able to sleep last night because the guy camped next to him had a loud radio on all night.  Finally, at about midnight, he went over to ask the guy to turn it down a little, and found the guy passed out in the tent, surrounded by empty beer cans.  He said he just went into the tent and turned off the radio.  The guy never even woke up. 
     While Jan was at the doctor Bob made several trips between his home and our campground helping us move all our gear, including our trikes to his home in San Luis Obispo.  It was an eventful and busy day for us.  We are very thankful at this point to have this opportunity to get to know Bob and Barb better and to be able to explore their lovely town of. It is really pretty here.      
     It is almost identical to our trikes, except that it has 16" wheels and is about 75% as large as our bikes.  We had a very informative visit with her.  This evening we went downtown and toured the Farmers Market that has been set up on Thursday nights since 1983.          Lots of good food, music, and loads of people.  We visited Bubble Gum Alley, located between the businesses at 733 and 737 Higuera Street.  Much to the delight of gum chewers everywhere, this sticky landmark has taken gum from under school desks and restaurant tables to its rightful place... on the wall.  Sometime in the late 1950s or early 1960s--the exact date is not yet a part of the history books--a bubble gum-chewing kid (or perhaps an adult?) stuck a wad of the pink goo on a solitary brick.  Slowly, the idea caught on and today the narrow 50-yard-long corridor is decorated with relief designs in a rainbow of colors.  There are flowers and initials, greetings and hearts, faces and dates.  One thing there isn't is obscenity.  Gum chewers, it seems, are above such things.  This is art, after all, not street gang graffiti.  Although some public officials have called the landmark "tacky and vulgar," no one has had the gumption to scrape the bricks clean--or to issue an ordinance against artists with chewing gum-laden palettes.  Came back to Bob and Barbara's house and began packing up our stuff.  We must go by the bike shop in the morning for a last adjustment of the bike pedal clips and then we're off for Morro Bay.    
   They were not staying in the park, though, as it is full and there was a friend along with a van, so they had to go find a motel.  Shortly after we arrived, Patrick and Mirjam, a nice young couple from Switzerland, came up and asked Bill if we were from Florida.  Seems that they ran across Hans and Elisabeth two days ago, and were told to be looking for us.  Another cyclist came in a few minutes later.  It was Jim, from Ireland.  We have met more foreign bicycle tourists than American.  And what a great bunch of people they have been!  We are getting ready to have a group campfire now, so gotta run....          


       and an abandoned lighthouse at Point Piedras Blancas.     The light has been removed and is on display in the little town of Cambria. We began the day with 9 miles of easier riding, but then we had many steep hills to climb with narrow or non-existant shoulders.  We passed by two slide reconstruction areas along the way.  One lane traffic. It was nice however, that the traffic came in spurts because of this construction.  We stopped for lunch at Ragged Point.     It was beautiful here and we took photos.        Spent time talking to a local cyclist.  Arrived at camp at 5:30 p.m., exhausted.  This biker camp is the most expensive so far - $10.  Had supper while we tried to dry out the tent and rainfly from putting it away wet this morning.  Didn't take too long, fortunately.  Relaxed after doing e-mails and journal and bookkeeping. There was one other cyclist in the bike camp, but he was not a touring cyclist; he is one of the well-known bicycle bums.  He told Jan that if he just had enough money to buy the right foods he would be able to ride more.  He has been in this camp for weeks, he said.  He was creepy and we avoided him the rest of our stay.  It is too bad the campground personnel can't tell the difference between a bum and a real touring cyclist, and make the bum move on so they don't have the oportunity to bug the rest of us, and make our stays miserable. He had no luggage and his seat was all duct tape and he acted strange.  We have no problem telling the difference. It is too bad, but like every thing else in life, there are those few who ruin things for the rest of us by their behavior. 
We went ahead and packed up and hit the road.  The place we intended to stay did not have showers, so we continued on to Limekiln Creek SP.  Right at the entrance to the park is where they have the traffic stopped waiting to get through the Big Sur slide area.  It was a rather long line of cars and it was wonderful riding past all those people who were in such a hurry to get around us!  They all just laughed and said "cool bikes".  Got checked in and then found out how different camping here is going to be.  We found the post for our site, but no camping area.  So, Jan went back to the entrance station and asked what the deal was.  He said, "didn't you see the trail?  There are are three sites about 500 yards up that trail; pick one of them."  Sure enough, we walked up the trail and there were three sites.  So, we lugged all our bags up and then carried the trikes up and got set up.  Then we found that the restroom facilities were quite aways away.  Oh well, we do have a rather nice campsite, even if it is better suited for someone hiking in.  After we got set up we went on a short hike to see the Lime Kilns.  The manufacture of lime at this location dates back to the early 1880's when Rockland Lime and Lumber Company began lime kiln operations.  Four stone and steel furnances were built at the base of a large, natural landslide that eroded from a limestone deposit.  These kilns were loaded with the stone, which had been sledded to the site, with large quantities of cordwood to maintain a fire.  This process, called "firing", slaked, or purified, the limestone, which was then packed into barrels made on the spot and hauled in wagons nearly a mile down the canyon.  At Rockland Landing a steam engine powered cable loaded the barrels aboard shipping vessels for a trip up the coast where lime was used as cement and in other commercial products.  The trail we walked roughly follows the old wagon trail, and you can see the massive furnaces and parts of the old roadbed once used to move the lime to Rockland Landing.  The trail to the historic lime kilns meanders along cascading Limekiln and West Fork creeks and through a small grove of redwoods.  We are 56 miles south of Carmel, CA.  The land from Limekiln Creek to Cone Peak presents the steepest coastal slope in the continental United States.  The redwoods growing here are some of the oldest and largest in Monterey County.  This area is where you first start seeing California's magnificent Coast Redwood, which is the world's largest known tree and one of the world's oldest trees.  Average mature trees, several hundred years old, stand from 200 to 240 feet tall and have diameters of 10 to 15 feet.  In the most favorable parts of their range, Coast Redwoods can live more than two thousand years.  Redwoods are named for the color of their bark and heartwood.  The high tannin content of the wood gives the trees remarkable resistance to fungus diseases and insect infestations, and periodic fires which occur naturally.  It is generally believed thad the last ice age limited the Coast Redwoods to their present range, a narrow 450-mile strip along the Pacific Ocean from central CA to southern OR.  There is also a 300-foot beach area here and is one of the few on this coast which is readily accessible.  After our hike we had supper and visited the beach one more time at sunset.  Then we hit the sack - we were tired.        
   
  Got up at 5:30 a.m. to get everything packed up and carried back down the trail and loaded up so we could make it through the Big Sur slide construction area. They told us the first group would be lead through by the pilot car at 7 a.m.  As we began to assemble our stuff one of the tent campers nearby let his two big dogs out, I guess to run loose and use the facilities unsupervised.  However, as you can guess, they came right after us barking and making all kinds of noise.  They woke everyone up, I am sure. The owner was upset and acted like we were the problem!  What a jerk! The dogs continued to bark horribly as we continued to load our bikes.  The owner did nothing to control them other than to tie them up.  We made it to the top of the hill and the entrance to the park, where the traffic was waiting to cross.      We didn't get to begin our passage until 7:15 a.m.  They seemed to expect us to be able to keep up with the pilot car and the traffic up the mountain at 30 mph! When we actually did arrive in the construction area, all the heavy machinery was working in the middle of the road and it was very dangerous for us to pass.  Finally, we caught the attention of one workman and he helped us get through.  He made us get off and attempt to push our loaded trikes through the deep gravel and sand.  What a mess.  Never have been so glad to get through a place before!! Not too much later, Bill had another flat on his back tire!  So, we unloaded all his gear and changed it along side the road.  Somehow in the process we messed up his 3 speed hub gearing system.  This made it harder for him to pedal up the hills because he couldn't get it into first gear.  We continued to ride up and down the mountains until we arrived at Pfeiffer Big Sur State Park Bike Camp at 3:19 p.m..  It took us all day to go 26 miles! We were beat and our knees hurt and our lips were blistered.  Got set-up and walked around the area and checked it out.  Nice park.  There is a store and lodge and cabins and a restaurant here.  After checking e-mail and eating we hit the sack. 
   From the base of the falls we then took the Valley View Trail.  It was a climb through the oak woodland to Valley View Overlook.  The view incuded much of the Big Sur Valley, Point Sur and Andrew Molera State Park.   It is rather cool here.  We wore our coats most of the day.  The staff here is particularly friendly to the point where they remember your first names even!  The guys in the registration booth even charged our camera battery for us!     What service!  We also were able to hand-wash two loads of laundry.  What a job that is.  Got tons of e-mail answered and the journal entries up to date. The weather was wonderul even though it was cooler than we have been used to.  In the late afternoon, we met a couple from Switzerland at the store.  They are also staying in the bike camp.  They have been touring for eight months now. 
  We had seen a sign when we entered the park advising that there was going to be some heavy traffic and congestion as a result of the upcoming Big Sur Marathon.  We didn't figure that it would interfere with our plans.  We hiked out of the park today and walked north about a kilometer to a BBQ restaurant that offered BBQ beef, ribs, or chicken, and all the fixin's for a reasonable price.  We thought we were going to get beef, ribs, or chicken.  What we ended up with was beef, ribs AND chicken.  Needless to say, it was a lot more food than we were used to.  Came back to the park and rode around a bit to help digest the food.    This old cabin is found in the park.  We thought it might be a great place to spend an evening, but, no dice. 
     When we were finally able to get out of the park, we had a short ride to Andrew Molera State Park.  It was a far cry from Big Sur.  No shade anywhere, and limited facilities.  This was another park where we had to pick the trikes up and carry them down a foot-path, with steps and water-bars and sharp switch-backs.  It was about a quarter-mile from the enterance to the camping area. 

   


   We arrived early, so we set up our tent, unpacked our bikes, and rode into town to pick up some groceries.  We found a nice used-book store, talked to some locals about our trikes and the trip, and were able to get our hair cut at a local barber shop.  Richard and Alberta got home at about 6:30 p.m., and made a fantastic dinner of lasagna, fresh artichokes (Jan had never eaten one before, and thought that it was an avocado), garlic bread, and salad, followed by fresh strawberries and ice cream. We put the tent up in their yard and then went back inside where we stayed up and told bicycling stories until 'way too late.  Finally got to bed at about 11:00 p.m. 
       

   Cannot get in until after 4:30 p.m.  Set-up at a picnic table and looked around at the historical stuff and the lighthouse and worked on the journal and e-mail. The fog cleared and the rained stopped, fortunately.  The hostel is perched on a cliff 50 miles south of San Francisco.  It provides the serenity of an oceanside reteat with the cooperative spirit of hosteling.  There are four 3 bedroom houses next to the lighthouse and there are overnight accomodations for up to 50 hostellers of all ages.  Each house has 3 male or female bunkrooms.  There are separate bunkrooms for couples and families.  Guests share bathrooms with hot showers, fully equiped kitchens and living rooms.  We were given a semi-private room, which turned out to be a private room, as no one else ehowed up.  We were able to cook dinner in the common kitchen area, and relaxed.  Rooms like ours were going for $200 per night and up, in the surrounding B&Bs.  What a deal!    
A little bit of history about Pigeon Point Lighthouse to start today off:  On January 28, 1853, the clipper ship "Carrier Pigeon" set sail from Boston for San Francisco, carrying 1300 tons of cargo.  On June 6, 1853, she ran aground near what was then called La Punta de la Ballena (Whale Point).  Although the ship was wrecked, the crew was saved.  Before long, the point of land was renamed Pigeon Point in memory of the "Carrier Pigeon".  The lighthouse stands 115' tall and sits on a 35' cliff and has been guiding mariners since 1872.  It was constructed following a string of shipwrecks.  Constructed of unreinforced brick, the lighthouse is the 2nd tallest on the West Coast.  The original first-order Fresnel Lens (the largest size) is still in place in the tower.  Invented by the frenchman, Augustine Fresnel, the lens consists of 1,008 glass prisms enclosing a light source.  The prisms concentrate the light, allowing a low-intensity light source to project a strong beam over a great distance.  Initially, the lamp inside the lens was a series of concentric wicks fueled by lard oil, giving off a light measured between 60,000 and 80,000 candelpower.  Later a kerosene lamp was substituted, and then a lamp which used vaporized oil, providing yet a stronger beam.  Finally, in the late 1920's, Pigeon Point switched to a 1,000 watt electric bulb, increasing the light to 680,000 candelpower (visible for more than 20 miles).  Each lighthouse has its own distinctive light pattern which makes it identifiable to passing ships.    We had a nice ride today. We took a bypass route that was beautiful.  We found some wonderful freshly baked bread at the Arcangeli Grocery Company in Pescadero as we were told by Richard and Alberta, our hosts back in Aptos.  We got sandwiches for lunch, too.    As we continued on our scenic detour we came upon a 10-foot skeleton made out of steel holding a 50 calibre machine gun outside a farmer's house, basically in the middle of nowhere!  It was a sight to see for sure.  We stopped and took a picture, of course.    Show links to this Hide links to this      Weather was great for our ride today too.  When we arrived in Half Moon Bay we were witnesses to an accident.  It was horrible.  A lady slowed down to make a turn and checked to make sure she wasn't going to hit us and the guy behind her didn't even slow down.  He demolished his car and it appeared to be new.  Hers had little damage.  Her first thoughts were to check and see if we were ok.  They were fine, though.  The guy was, too.  Both of his air bags came out.  We waited for the police and gave the lady our card.  We didn't get hit with any of the flying car parts and are fine.  We are at the biker camp at Half Moon Bay State Beach.  Met the ranger here, Kim Baker, who is a friend of our hosts Richard and Alberta in Aptos. We couldn't believe it!  Ate our supper and went to bed because it was already dark outside!    
   This day is no different.  We got up and went into Half Moon Bay.  First order of business was to find some breakfast, which we did at Original Johnnie's.  We both had eggs, hashbrowns, toast and bacon.  It was very good.  We once again saw a sign for Olollaberry pie.  So, we inquired on it.  They didn't have any.  It is not in season and appears to be a coastal thing.  The description is this....a blackberry/raspberry on steroids.  Interesting.  Went on to do our laundry.  Was able to sit in a small park while accomplishing this task that no one likes to do.  It is a rainy and cold day.  Glad we are not out riding.  Relaxed the rest of the day. 
   We specifically mean the people who hollered things that were not nice at us out their car windows as they drove by.  We had a visit last night from a couple on a BikeE tandem. They are writers, on a trip heading north.  They are testing the BikeE to write about it.  They also test clothing and restaurants and hotels and motels and B&Bs.  It was an interesting visit.  They took a spin on the trikes and we all took pictures.          It was super cold last night too.  At least the wind died down. Got up early to get on our way to Daly City and our host Mark Sapiro's house.  It was a steep hill day.  We also had one really scary section of Hwy 1 called Devil's Slide.  It was about 3 miles of no shoulders, up some hills and around many blind corners.  Since we are writing this journal entry, we have lived to tell about it!  The hill coming into Daly City was long and very steep, too.  Our legs and knees sure got their workout today!!      Arrived at Mark's house at 3 p.m.  Found it with no problem.  Visited for awhile and then we relaxed for the rest of the evening.    
   We had wonderful views of the Golden Gate bridge and took many photos.     Riding across the bridge itself was not as traumatic as Jan had feared.  It was a wide sidewalk and not too crowded since it was a weekday.  It was not windy nor raining either.  Could not see the views from the bridge, except through the railings, because our trikes are rather low to the ground.                 After you leave the north end of the bridge you ride through a short piece of country and come into the lovely little town of Sausalito.  We had lunch there at a Danish cafe called the Lighthouse.  The food was excellent and we ate way too much, but just couldn't help it; we were starving and it was good.  Besides, it is fuel and we need it to get up the hills!  We then made a stop at the grocery store to resupply our granola bars and pop tarts!  We also sent another box of stuff home.  This one weighted 6 lbs.  It was a nice rest stop.  Made it to Mark's, in Mill Valley, around 3 p.m.  Stowed the trikes in the garage and we set-up our sleeping arrangements. Talked for some time and then had a wonderful supper of Salmon and rice and salad.  We then relaxed the rest of the evening. 

It began to pour right after we got under way.  We decided that leaving the Page's home was not such a good idea.  Oh, well.  We stopped for lunch at a cafe in the town of Lagunitas.  The apple pie was excellent, along with their chili.  While we were there Bill's left front tire went flat!  We came out of the cafe to leave and began to ride off and saw the flat!  #5 for Bill.  Jan still hasn't had one yet!   Knock on wood.  The damage to the tube was so bad it could not be fixed as all the others had been.  This time it was around the stem area and a couple of other holes on top of that!!  Fixed it as we always do, but it was cold and raining.  We were partially under a roofed area and that helped.  Continued on after the repair and arrived at Samuel P. Taylor State Park Biker camp at 3:00.  It was still pouring so we hung up our blue tarp so we could set-up our tent without getting it soaked in the process.  It worked. Then we towel-dried all our bags so they wouldn't get the tent floor soaked.  That worked too.  Getting ourselves in without getting everything wet was not as easy.  We changed all our clothes to get dry, but have no place to hang anything so we designated a corner of the tent as "the wet pile".  It is all more than wet too....drenched is more like it.  Even all of our GoreTex gear didn't keep out the rain.  Our cycling jackets failed completly and so did our shoes.  Our North Face GoreTex coats held up perfectly, but we didn't put these on until we were at the cafe, which is only 3 miles from the park.  Anyway, we did complete our e-mail by walking back to the front gate of the park after the rain slowed down.  Came back and got into our sleeping bags for the night.  No sooner had we laid down that we heard someone trying to rip the door off of our storage box.  It was some raccoons!  They were trying to get our food.  Bill went out to see what was going on.  He rearranged the food so they couldn't reach around the door and pull it out, which is exactly what they were trying to do!  We had put a lock on it.  Luckily, we had our tarp bungeed to the door so they didn't get anything from us!  We protect our food!! It is too far to ride into a town to replace it.  It rained most of the night; pretty hard at times.  The park was totally empty when we arrived.  After the rangers made their rounds it became very active, which just happened to be as soon as it got dark.  I couldn't believe it.  I guess this is how they avoid paying the fees? 
Some information about Samuel P. Taylor State Park:   Samuel P. Taylor, scouting for a supply of lumber for his lumber interests, entered this area on horseback over Indian trails in 1854.  He purchased the 100 acres that is now the center of the park from Radael Garcia.  In 1856 he constructed the first papermill on the Pacific coast.  Almost a century later, in 1946, this area was included in the formation of this State Park. This area was one of the first in the United State to offer camping as a recreational pursuit. 

     The sandwiches were very good. Arrived at Bodega Bay around 6 p.m.  Once again we have to share the biker site with a bike bum. Fortunately, he placed his tent in the woods out of sight.  He has been here some time.  He told us he is handicapped and only has to pay $1.50 per night.  We did meet more American touring cyclists today. 
   Following that visit, officials of the fur company made plans to establish settlements in California as sources of food for its trading posts in Alaska.  Fort Ross, once located approximately 10 miles south of Stewarts Point, was founded by the fur company, and was the chief outpost of Russian civilization in California. In the spring of 1812, the Russian ship Chirikov, deposited a party of fur traders under the command of Ivan Kuskof.  They began building a fortress, and on August 30, dedicated it with a ceremony, naming it Rossiya (Russia).  They also established the settlements Port Roumiantzoff, Bodega, and Kuskof.  The Russians cultivated land towards the tip of Bodega Peninsula, and erected two warehouses for grain.      Despite the efforts of apprehensive Spanish officials to check the growth of the fort of the Russians, the Russian colonists began a thriving trade with the San Francisco Presido and mission, exchanging grain, peas, meat, tallow, flour, and hides for tobacco, sugar, iron, cloth, wax candles, and other required supplies.  When two additional missions, San Rafael and San Francisco Solano, were founded to halt Russian expansion southward, the Russians extended their trade to include these new mission customers.    In 1835 General Mariano G. Vallejo gave three American sailors large land grants on the condition that they settle at the border of the Russian claims and check further Russian expansion.  However, it was the rapid extermination of the sea-otter along the coast and resulting low revenues that ended Russian expansion in California.  Unable to make a living from farming, and restrained by the Spanish from expanding southward, the Russian colonies ended in failure.  In 1824, Russia agreed to limit its future settlements on the west coast of North America to the Alaska region.    Johann August Sutter, founder of New Helvetia (Sacremento), took ownership of Fort Ross in 1841.  The price -- including 1,700 head of cattle, 940 horses, 9,000 sheep, a small arsenal, and even the 20-ton schooner Constantine -- was $30,000.00, most to be paid to the Russians in yearly installments of produce and wheat.  Sutter dismantled the fort and buildings and shipped everything he could carry on his schooner New Helvetia. 



We got up at our regular time of 5:30 a.m. and got everything packed up.  Angelica and David both got up too to see us off and to see how we had our stuff loaded up and how our trikes were ridden.  We had hoped to stop at the little store on our way, but it didn't open at 7 a.m. like the sign said.  We waited until 7:15 a.m. and finally gave up and continued on down the road.  Our first stop was in the small town of Stewart's Point at the General Store (1868).  We were able to pick up a few groceries and some other needed items.  This small store was well-stocked for bicyclists!  We were impressed.  The prices were not high, either.  Bill was able to get 2 free cups of coffee, too.  We also met up with a 73 year-old man who was riding from Seattle back to his home in Long Beach, California!  He was in good shape for sure! After we left the store there was road line-painting going on.  They had the road blocked to one lane and a pilot car taking the traffic through.  This was nice for us, because it meant we only had traffic to contend with every 20 minutes or so. The area we were riding through was a large housing development called Sea Ranch. The rather large homes had shed roofs and unpainted wood siding. This is characteristic of the "cut-out vertical box" architecture pioneered at Sea Ranch.  The ride was nice today.  Up and down riding, but nothing really steep.  Got to Gualala Point County Park at around 12:30 p.m.  After getting our tent set-up we headed down the trail, which led out from the rear of the hiker/biker area to the visitor's center and the beach.  The trail was nice and so was the visitor's center.  We then walked all the way to the ocean and back. While walking along the beach Jan found a brand new empty wallet.  She needed a new wallet so we found this to be a blessing and interesting. What are the chances of this happening?  It was a nice walk, although extremely windy, and we really enjoyed it.  It seems we have this campground all to ourselves.  How nice. We are in the bicyclist's camp area.  All is well. 
   Before the evening was over a German couple from Stuttgart-Leonburg (where we used to live 10 yrs ago), and Deb Cunningham, from Chapel Hill, NC showed up.     Deb had ridden her bike all the way from NC. We made spaghetti for supper and shared with Deb. We all talked together for some time and then, after hanging our food bags in the trees where the 'coons couldn't get to them, we turned in for the evening.  
             
   When we left the KOA it was only 48 degrees.  We wore our cycling coats all day.  We rode through the spot on the map called Albion.  We stopped in the General Store there, planning on getting something for lunch.  Jan inquired about the possibility of using the rest room, and the woman behind the counter was so rude that you would have thought that we asked her to empty out the cash register.  We decided to find somewhere else to spend our money.    The route today was very hilly and our knees hurt at the end of the day.  We arrived at Van Damme State Park at 4 p.m. and got set-up. Then we walked back to the entrance to drop our fees into the fee box.  On our way back to our campsite we stopped at the visitors center.  It was constructed by the CCC in 1940. It still has its historic character even though it has been extensively modified.  The exhibit here was called "Living With The Sea". We were able to get maps and information for the Jackson History Trail, The Pygmy Forest Trail and the Fern Canyon Trail.  The Fern Canyon Trail leaves from our camping area and takes you to the Pygmy Forest.  We plan to walk these tomorrow.  After returning to our campsite we decided we needed snacks so we walked to the store nearby and picked up some snacks and ramen.  Ate supper and then relaxed.  Had another biker come in at dinner time.  He rode from the Bay Area up to Crescent City, CA, and is now on his way back to Marin County.    
     On the way to the forest we only met one man out for a run. On the way back to the campground we met several people on their way out. It was a nice trail, that was quite wide and followed the Little River most of the way.  We had 8 crossings of it.  We also walked by 10 hike-in environmental campsites at the 1.75 mile marker.  The Pygmy Forest and the terraces below it disclose an intricate web of ecological interaction of soils, climate, and geology that produced an area that is unique in the world.  Here, and nowhere else, are found these species of plants that are decades old but are only a few feet tall.  Their gnarled, lichen-encrusted trunks are less than an inch in diameter.  There are several species of plants that are exlusive to this forest.  This was definately a unique and interesing phenomenon to see.  We returned to the campground by 1 p.m. and had lunch.  Then we walked up to the visitors center to get coffee, and spoke with the camp host for some time.  Returned to our tent and relaxed for a little while. Around 4 p.m. we walked up to the upper camping area to visit with the camp hosts that we met earlier in the day.  They had invited us to stop by.  We visited until 6:30 p.m. and we had to leave for a previous invitation in our camping area.  We made it just in time to get our wonderful piece of breaded cooked Abalone.  It tasted a lot like regular fish and was really good.  Came back to our campsite and made our own supper to go with it.  No other bicyclists in our camping area tonight.  It is the beginning of the Memorial Day Holiday.  The sign out front says the campground is full, but during our walk around we saw many open sites.  I guess though not everyone gets off work early! 

Relaxed the rest of the day.  The pretend hikers finally left our area after noon.  First we had to listen to their loud, irritating music some more.  They had it going pretty late last night, too.  We also had to listen to their x-rated behavior for some time.  We couldn't pick up any radio stations in order to drown them out.  The ranger had come by earlier to tell them they weren't allowed to camp where they were.  They tried to tell him they hiked in.  They had a huge Coleman stove on the table along with a gallon of white gas, a large box of food, a boom box and a huge family size tent with large sleeping bags and a large pile of clothing.  He said that he knew they were lying and they had to leave in the morning.  Since it was so late he let them stay overnight.  We are pretty sure they came back late on purpose.  They were very inconsiderate people.  So, we were the ones who had to suffer because of them.  Otherwise we had a restful day.  We spent some time talking to our new camp host friends, the Freeman's also. 
Visited with our new friends, the Freeman's some more and traded our used books with them.  Bill was given two brand new books by authors he likes.  I picked out two also.  Relaxed the rest of the day. This evening we walked up the hill to have dinner with the Freeman's.  They cooked a whole turkey on their Pyramid Stove, which uses charcoal.  It was great! 
It provides an ideal inspired setting for the artist to create and be refreshed.  We were not impressed.  I suppose because we are not shoppers.  Lots of little shops to spend your money at. Continued on 11 more miles and arrived in Fort Bragg.  First stop was a laundromat where we washed our tent and sleeping bags and our clothes. There was a Rite-Aide here also, so we did some shopping there.  After finishing up with the laundry we went to Safeway.  Then went to a Mystery bookstore!!!  Next stop was the library to update our website.  For some reason we could not access Angelfire to update our website.  After trying for over an hour we gave up.  We were able to load all our photos at least.  Left the library and headed to Mackerricher State Park.  The bicyclist camp was closed for a school group, so they put us on a regular campsite.  It was fine with us.  Got everything set-up and ate supper.  Relaxed a little finally right before bed. Some info about Fort Bragg: The famous Skunk Train, ran by the California Western Railroad, is located in this town.  It runs from Fort Bragg, 40 miles, to Willits.  Originally a logging railroad, the "Skunk" line dates back to 1885.  Steam passenger service was started in 1925 when the self-powered yellow "Skunk" rail cars were inaugurated.  The little trains were nicknamed for their original gas engines, prompting folks to say, "you can smell 'em before you can see 'em."  Now, as then, travel on this line is delightfully casual, with frequent stops to deliver mail and groceries in areas inaccessible by car.  This train is a standard gauge system.  Originally it's route had 115 bridges.  Today there are only 30. Interestingly, the celebrity status of the skunk train did not come until the 1950s when fame suddenly arrived.  This came through articles in Sunset Magazine, the National Geographic, Trains, Model Railroader, and other publications.  It became even better known through it's use in the motion picture "Johnny Belinda" in 1948, which won an academy award for Jane Wyman. It was used in the films "Runaway on the Rouge River" by Disney, in 1974, and Paramount's "Racing With The Moon" in 1984 also. Fort Bragg was once known as a working lumber town.  Downtown Fort Bragg's architecture dates back to the early 1900's, rebuilt after the same terrible earthquke of 1906 which destroyed San Francisco. This earthquke caused an economic boon because local mills furnished much of the lumber used to rebuild San Francisco. On July 20, 1850, The Frolic, a brig hauling goods from China to San Francisco, was wrecked on the coast about 4 miles south of Fort Bragg.  Those who came here seeking treasure from the wreckage found instead the richness of the redwood forests.  This was the catalyst for settlement.  Prior to this time, Fort Bragg was home to the Pomo Indianas, a tribe of hunters and gatherers.  In 1856, the Bureau of Indian Affairs established a 25,000-acre reservation.  The next year (1857) the Fort was established next to the reservation to maintain order.  The military outpost and reservation was abandoned in 1864.  During this time, a number of small lumber mills sprouted up in the area. In 1885 the Fort Bragg Railroad was founded and C.R. Johnson established the Redwood Lumber Company.  In 1891, small mills combined to form the Union Lumber Co.  Fort Bragg was incorporated as a city in 1889 and C.R. Johnson became the first mayor.  The city was named after Colonel Braxton Bragg.  Fort Bragg, NC, was later named after the same officer. 
We have already met some really nice people here. There names are:  Robert and Naomi Swinney and Larry D. Rioux and his girlfriend, Stacey.  Naomi made us ham sandwiches with lettuce and tomato and mustard and mayo for lunch!  They were delicious. Then she got out chips and salsa!  Plus she made coffee for Bill and gave me a Pepsi!!! It was wonderful.      Today we rode through tons of little butterflies.  They were everywhere.  They were all different colors.  They are all over the campground too. The weather has been pretty cool.  We left this morning wearing our fleece coats with our cycling coats over them. It is much warmer now.  Jan's face is all red from wind burn.  The wind was really bad yesterday.  The sand was stinging our faces. Everyone wanted to take a ride on the trikes.        When dinner time rolled around our new friends invited us to join them.  We had flounder, corn on the cob, and homemade french fries.  It was great.  After supper we sat by a campfire and talked.  We didn't get to bed until after 11 p.m., which is super late for us.      
   Found the bicyclist camp and got set-up.  Went and paid our fees and then went on a short hike down to the South Fork of the Eel River and to see why the Redwood Camping area down there was closed.  That there was no bridge across the river may have had something to do with the closure.      Headed back up the hill to our campsite and took showers.  It was wonderfully hot water.  We were the only campers in the park most of the day.  Read our books and studied our maps and tourist information the rest of the afternoon.  We even had a wild turkey visit us at our tent.  "Gobble, Gobble" he said and walked away.  One thing we have noticed right away different about today is that it is warm and we didn't have to wear any coats all day!  The mosquitos here are ferocious, though.    This park is considered the gateway to California's "redwood country".  Standish-Hickey State Recreation Area began as a 40-acre campground, donated to the state in 1922 by the Hickey family.  It was to honor Edward Ritter Hickey, son of a local lumberman who had died of influenza while caring for victims of the 1918 epidemic.  In the late 1950s the Standish family donated over 500 acres.  More additions were made through the years, thanks to the Save-The-Redwoods League.  It is over 1,000 acres now. 
A young man came in just before dark on a bicycle towing a BOB trailer (a one-wheeled bicycle trailer).  He had ridden close to 100 miles! It wasn't an easy 100 either.  We couldn't believe it. We got up at our usual time and got packed up and on the road by 6:30 a.m.  We had a good shoulder on the road, which was nice.  Then we got on Hwy 271, which had no traffic, so it didn't matter whether or not we had a shoulder.  The ride was beautiful and not too hard.  For once it seemed we had more downs than ups.  We enjoyed the ride immensely. We rode by Confusion Hill, which says that magnetic currents upset gravity, providing unusual phenomena. It was closed when we went by. It's really just an illusion created by building a house on a hill at an angle that makes everything off-kilter a bit, and it seems that objects roll up hill.  We made a rest stop at a 76 station, which we found to be only 1 mile from the entrance to Richardson Grove State Park where we intended to stop.  We arrived at 11 a.m.  They let us pick any site we wanted instead of staying in the bicyclist camp.  We picked a spot by the restroom facilities.  Got set-up and headed to the Visitor's Center area.  Here is where we met Earl and Mary Thompson, the Volunteers.  They take their jobs seriously, too.  They spent over an hour telling us about the park itself, and everything on up the coast that was not to be missed.  It was wonderful!  We left with tons of information and new friends!  We got a bite to eat and sat by a big tree to eat.  Walked the grove trail and then up to the Thomson's private camping area.  They wanted us to check it out.  It was very nice.  Then we hiked the Woodland Trail Loop and several other shorter ones.  It was really nice.  Then we hiked back to the 76 store to pick up some soda and hot dogs.  On the way we stopped and saw the Grandfather Tree.  This Redwood tree is world-famous for its picturesque qualities.  It stretches 245' tall with one of the largest tree trunks on the Redwood Hwy, measuring 24' in diameter and 55' in circumference.  Then we visited the One-Log Home.  In 1946, this famous 2,000 year old, 40-ton log was painstakingly hand-hewn to form living quarters. It toured the country for some time, but now has a permanent home at "Bear Meadow".  There were many carved bears and other items for sale here. Walked back to our campsite and had supper.  Afterwards, Earl and Mary came by in their car and picked us up and took us to their campsite to have 'Smores. Their campsite was out on a point overlooking the river.  It was fun.  They invited us to a picnic tomorrow night too, with them and some Rangers!  They have been married 57 years!!  They have been volunteers here for 10 years. We really had a good time with them and we met them just by walking into the visitors center here! The most prominent natural feature of Richardson Grove State Park is the old-growth redwood forest itself.  Many trees in the main grove are more than 1,000 years old.  Quite a few are more than 300 feet tall.  It was very impressive and a memorable experience to walk the trails among these redwood giants. 
       Relaxed some and got our e-mail and journal caught up. This evening, we went back to Earl and Mary's campsite for a hot dog roast with them and three park rangers and their families.  A very nice evening.          
     We stopped at the laundromat to do our laundry.  It had opened at 6 a.m.  Not many people this morning, fortunately, so we didn't have to wait in line like we sometimes have to do.  While doing the laundry the fog lifted and the sun came out.  The ride was wonderful today.  Not hilly for once.  Arrived at the Avenue of the Giants.  Stopped at Stop #1 - F.K. Lane Grove.  The trees here are part of the ancient, or old growth, coast redwoods. Their average ages are 400-600 years.  At stop #2 - Bolling Grove.  The trees in this grove have many burls on them.  Here we also helped a boy scout and the man with him by loaning him our tools so he could fix the boy's bicycle chain.  He was out earning a merit badge.  He had to ride 50 miles today.  It is best to do that with a properly functioning bike!  Stop #3 was the Visitor Center.   Here we met some other cyclists out for the day and Ranger O'Rourke, whom we had met last night.  Burlington campground was here, too.  He told us the Biker Camp was out by itself with no facilities and to go to the campground entrance and tell them we want a regular tent site here for the bicyclist's price ($6.00).  So, that is what we did.  It worked with no problem.  After saying good-bye to our audience, we found our campsite, got set-up and headed back to the Visitors Center.  It was just opened recently and very nice.  We watched a video and looked at all the displays.  One of the most interesting things was Charles Kellogg's Travel-Log, which must qualify as one of the world's first and most unusual motorhomes.  It is a masterpiece of nature and craftsmanship, made from a section of a giant redwood tree from Scotia, CA.  It is the largest single piece of hewn timber in the world.  It is mounted on a Nash Quad truck chasis, the only truck capable (at that time) of transporting such a load and meet its requirements.  Using an axe and adz, Mr. Kellogg hollowed out the log and fashioned it into this most beautiful and complete dwelling; it has a kitchenette, folding lavatory, toilet, clothespress, 12 lockers, folding double bed, stove, dining table, bookcase, dresser, electric lights, running water, guest room with single bed, lockers, etc.  The log out of which this beautiful home is made is absolutely solid; walls, ceiling, floors are all made of one piece, weighing in at six tons.  This particular log was about 4800 years old  when Mr Kellog built the Travel-Log, which he drove around the country in the early 1920's to publicize the importance of preserving and protecting the California Redwood forests.  An interesting note about the Nash Quad truck is that it not only was a four-wheel drive vehicle, but all four wheels were steerable, which was useful in negotiating the difficult and narrow, winding mountain passes.  The park that we are camped at, Humboldt Redwoods State Park, is, at 53,000 acres, the third largest State Park in CA, stretching some 40 miles along highway 101.  It contains 17,000 acres of old growth Redwoods, and the largest remaining stand of ancient Redwoods in the world.  The oldest recorded coastal Redwood tree, more than 2,200 years old,was found in the park.        

   The Dyersville Giant is a Coast Redwood that fell to the ground in 1991.  At the time it fell, it was recognized as the "Champion" Coast Redwood by the American Forestry Association.  Before it fell it was at least 362 feet tall and 17 feet in diameter, 200 feet higher than Niagara Falls, or comparable to a 30 story building. It was probably the tallest tree on earth at that time.  Jan waited with the trikes while Bill went with the camera to take a picture.  While sitting here I saw many logging trucks come out of the back of the park filled to the rim with the huge trees.  It is 7 a.m.; wonder if this is an every day activity?  Also witnessed several local people stop by and put their household garbage in the park dumpster. Interesting, the things you observe while sitting on a bike.  People seem to think I am invisible, I guess, because I am on a bike.  A park ranger just drove up and jumped out and walked rather quickly up the same trail Bill did.  We are the only people here because it is early.  After Bill returned a couple from Illinois drove in with their 5th Wheel.  Jan walked the trail with them.  Rode a few more miles to the town of Redcrest and stopped at the local cafe for breakfast.  It was about time.  We were starving because it was after 9 a.m.  The Eternal Tree House was in back of the cafe.  It was once a towering giant that was hollowed out into living quarters.  14 new trees over 40' tall have grown from the still-live roots.  It was interesting.     Left here and rode to the town of Scotia to do the Pacific Lumber Company Mill Tour. It was a free and self-guided tour on the catwalks of a working lumber mill, which just happens to be the largest redwood sawmill of its kind in the world.  Since 1869 they have been growing trees, making wood products and employing people in Northern California and maintaining a proud history of forest care.  We were able to leave our bikes with the security guards to watch while we did the tour.  The first thing we saw was the log pond/debarker.     The pond covered 32 acres.  Logs are moved in the pond by workers using long poles and a small boat.  Water from the nearby Eel river shoots through a hydraulic hose at 1600 psi of pressure and at 1200 gallons per minute, sending stripped bark pieces flying.  The Douglas Fir then goes into the log pond to be floated to the other sawmill in Scotia and the redwood is put directly into Mill B.  The cutting section was closed due to some environmental activity going on locally.  The next section we saw was the End-And-Edge-Glue Division.  Short and narrow kiln-dried boards are finger-jointed together on the ends and glued together on the edges to produce longer, wider and higher-value lumber.  Used as paneling, siding and fascia, this product is an economic alternative to solid lumber and makes use of small pieces of wood that were previously wasted. Remanufacturing was the next operation.  Equipment for cutting, planing, beveling and sorting operations are arranged down the center of a large building.  Jan's favorite part of the tour was was the monorail that was moving stacks of finished product on tracks overhead that ran the length of the building.  Then we saw the Grading/Shipping section.  Kiln-dried lumber is inspected and marked according to its "grade" or quality.  The finished lumber is then shipped from Scotia via truck or rail car.  We arrived at exactly noon. The entire town of Scotia is owned by the Pacific Lumber Company.    Left this place and made a stop at the grocery store for lunch.  Headed out of town to Fortuna and the KOA.  We bypased the route recommended by the ACA, and missed the little town of Rio Dell.  We had been told by some locals in Redcrest to continue on to Fortuna rather than stopping in Rio Dell to camp.  Arrived at 3:30 p.m. and found that the KOA is now Riverwalk RV Park and Campground.  It is very nice.  Got a tent site and got set-up.  Took our showers and then did our laundry.  Headed to Denny's for supper.  It was very good.  We got a 10% discount with our camping receipt!  Picked up some snacks at the 76 station and headed back to the campground.  Was hanging out in the laundry room and ran into some RV'ers we know from Hesperia/Victoriville, CA area!  We couldn't believe it.  Bill was able to get his doggie fix with Sally....she was a good pal of Sammie's!  Talked with Joni and Frank for awhile.  They caught us up on all the news of mutual acquaintances.  Afterwards we read our books and worked on this journal.  Another very good riding day, with few hills and smooth highways.  All is well. 
   We dried their stuff by our heater. Everything they had was soaked from riding all day in the rain.  Bill went over the map with them to San Francisco, telling them where the worst hills were and where to stay.  Took our showers and hit the sack. 
   We were first in line for the internet so that was great.  Bill is updating our website while I work on this journal entry.  While I was waiting with the bikes, up drove Laurie and Mary from Richardson Grove State Park!  I couldn't believe it and neither could they that we met up again.  Talked for awhile and they went into the library to see Bill, too.  They went on their way and we finished up at the library.  On our way back into town we ran into them again and our host's mom!  She was real nice, too.  Laurie, Mary, and the two of us went to a place called Curly's Cafe for lunch.  It was excellent.  We had a good time.  We all had to check out the restroom facilities because they were pretty fancy digs.  We went outside and Laurie discovered that she had locked her keys in the car.  Being the well-prepared bicyclists that we are, Bill took his bike flag off the bike and pushed it through the window and poked the button that clicked the doors open.  She was overjoyed at Bill's quick thinking.  They went on their way and we headed to our host's house.  It was about 3 miles out in the country.  When we arrived Kristie, our hostess, was already there.  We met their dogs Gaby and Brodie and got our stuff in the house.  As we were doing this Bill discovered that my 3-speed hub was broken completly and that my back tire had become crooked.  It was loose.  I guess we didn't get it back in properly after fixing the flat yesterday.  He took the hub completely apart and fixed it.  We also got our mail.  It has been over a month since we had seen any of our mail.  Mostly it was just doctor and hospital bills!  What a mess that is becoming for us.   Around 5:30 p.m. Trevor arrived home from work.  They took one of the trikes for a spin and then we all went into the house.  Talked and had a great supper.  They retired early because they had to go to work early the next day.  We took showers and also went to bed.  We were beat. 
   Had lunch and talked to the Chief of Police as he was on his walking beat.  He had retired from the Sheriff's Department after 30 years.  He had always thought that if the Chief's job ever came open here in Ferndale, he would apply.  Well, it did, and here he is!      Little towns are nice!  It is unfortunate that this town is about 5 miles off of the Pacific Coast bicycle route.  Most touring cyclists pass right by on Hwy 101 and never even get to see it!  What a shame.  Arrived at the library a little after noon to work on our website.  It took almost two hours!  After we got done at the library it began to rain a little bit.  Made a stop at the grocery store for supper and breakfast and headed back to our host's house very quickly.  Drizzled on us, but we didn't get too wet.  Got the bikes back in the garage. Relaxed around the house the rest of the day and evening.  It was great.  Got all of the mail organized and answered and the pocketmail finally got all our mail from last week sent to us!  Got it all answered.  The entertainment of the evening was loose baby cows out in front of the house.    The farmer came with a bucket of food to lure them back through the hole in the fence and back to mom. Then they fixed the fence.  That was their second escape of the day. 
  Got up around 7:30 a.m.  Trevor was busy doing housework and waiting for his sister to arrive.  They went out for breakfast.  They returned and we headed out to tour the Lost Coast in his sister Sonya's van.  Sonya is a hospice nurse in the local area.  The road was steep and a little curvy, but Jan did not get car sick.  We went through the towns of Capetown, Petrolia and Honeydew, which is where we turned around and returned the way we came.  Along the way we stopped on the beach to check the tide pools.     Bill found a perfect skeleton of a sea urchin.  It was purple, Jan's favorite color.  We gave it to Trevor for his collection.  We found many pretty rocks that Sonya took home for her garden.  The dogs had a great time. We also stopped at A.W. Way County Park and took a short walk along the Mattole River.  It was beautiful and the dogs Gaby and Brodie had a great time chasing their balls in the water.  The day was sunny and nice.  Perfect!!  Stopped at a large sand dune on the way back for the dogs to play in, too.  They had so much fun.  The Lost Coast is a nearly forgotten land of mountains, valleys and isolated beaches near Cape Mendocino, the western-most point in the lower 48 states.  The paved road follows Mattole Road for 70 hilly miles between Ferndale and the Avenue Of The Giants.  It was certainly a beautiful ride.  The famous San Andreas Fault terminates near Cape Mendocino.  In 1992 a strong earthquake shook the north coast and did much damage in Honeydew and Petrolia.  We went grocery shopping around 7:30 p.m. Got back around 9 and took showers, cooked bread sticks and a pizza and did our laundry.        
   Bill then helped them cut wood while I worked on our e-mail and the journal.  The weather became pretty cloudy and then it rained.  Talked for a little while and then Bill worked on our website on their computer.  Supper was next on our agenda.  We had lasagna, garlic bread and salad.  It was very good.  Then we watched the weather and got the bad news about the rain being predicted for tomorrow.  Took showers and did our laundry. 

   First we climbed to the top of Lookout Rock and then we followed the rim trail to Patrick's Point Rock and this is where we saw a California Gray Whale and her calf!  We saw them come up for air many times.  This was our first whale siting.  Continued on the Rim Trail to the Wedding Rock and Mussel Rocks Overlook.  Walked to Agate Campground and then returned to our camping area by road.  When we got back we worked on this journal and did several chores around our campsite.  The sun was wonderful.  The beach here is named for the semi-precious agates that the ocean polishes here by the constant movement of sand and water. 

   Ed was on a REI Navarro and Randy was on a Vision recumbent.  They are heading to San Francisco from Seattle.  They headed out about 9 a.m., which is when we met them at the front gate.  We were there extending our stay and heading out to hike.  We became our other personas, Spiderman and Nunnehi (our trail names from the Appalachian Trail) today out on the trails.  It was 12 miles round trip.  We walked to Fern Canyon.     Lush ferns covered the canyon's 50 ft high walls and moss carpeted fallen tree trunks.  The most common fern there was the delicate five-fingered one.  We also saw lady and sword ferns.  We followed the crystal clear creek that wound into the canyon floor and then hiked back up the stairs into the forest.  We were on the lookout for a rare species of tailed frog, but did not see it.  To get to the Fern Canyon Loop trail we hiked the James Irvine Trail from the Visitors' Center.  We could see the ocean from the parking area when we arrived at the Fern Canyon loop.  Here is where we also saw a large elk with a huge rack of antlers.  We got some good pictures.     After we got back to our campsite we worked on fixing our tire tubes with patches and worked on this journal.  The weather was wonderful.  Warm and sunny. 
           The group that came to visit were all females, except for one young male, called a spike, because of the two little spikes of antlers.  Yesterday, while visiting Fern Canyon, we saw and photographed a large bull elk, with a magnificent set of antlers, but dared not approach too closely.  Full-grown males can exceed 1800 pounds, and can be dangerous.  We have been told that the females are not especially aggressive, but can be unpredictable.  Getting stepped on by one would certainly ruin your day!  We spent the remainder of the afternoon just lazing around enjoying the serene beauty of this park.  This park, like Pfeiffer Big Sur State Park and Richardson Grove State Park are on our list of "Best" California State Parks.  We will be sure to return here in the future. 
   Our first stop was the Forest Cafe, a really neat place across the street from the Trees Of Mystery, for a breakfast treat.  We needed it.  All day long we seemed to be climbing.  We had a cumulative gain of about 3500 feet today.  We finally arrived in Crescent City at about 3 p.m. and made a stop at Wal-Mart to pick up some tire patch kits.  Jan had another flat today just as we got into town.  She also bought another tube, but at the end of the day, we discovered that someone (expletive deleted), had switched tubes in the box, and we ended up with a tube that is way too big for our bikes.  After getting our shopping done, we made our way to the Crescent City KOA, where hot showers and laundry facilities awaited. 
  Was on the road at our usual time.  Weather was great! Our route took us off Hwy 101 and into the nearby farming communities.  It was wonderful....until Jan had another flat!  Fixed it and went on our way.  The route this morning was predominantly flat and we just cruised along enjoying the scenery.  Made it to the Oregon border by 9 a.m.  Stopped and took pictures and had a gentleman and his wife stop and offer to take our picture together with the "Welcome to Oregon" sign.  They also had many questions about our trip and our trikes.  So, we spoke with them for a while and then got back on the road.  Made our first official stop of the day in the town of Harbor.  There were picnic tables with little shops nearby to purchase coffee and other items.  We ate lunch that we had brought with us.  We noticed that as we crossed into Oregon, the roads improved greatly, with wider, cleaner shoulders.  Headed out on our way again around 11:30 a.m.  After a very steep climb back up to the highway, Brookings was only 1 mile down the road.  Checked the hours of the library for tomorrow.  Stopped at a Fred Meyers store and picked up some more tube repair stuff and some food and some other items.  Jan had ANOTHER flat while we were stopped here.  Fixed it and decided to stop for the day at Harris Beach State Park Hiker/Biker Camp.  It was crowded compared to all the others we have stayed at.  4 tents were already set-up.  The price was odd too - $4.24 per person.  That's because the park is within the city limits, so there is a bed tax of 24 cents.  Even the laundry at the KOA last night in Crescent City had an odd price - $1.10 per load.  Usually it is 1.25 or $1.50.   Set-up our campsite and then walked to the Visitors' Information Center across the street from the park.  Here we obtained a mile-by-mile guide to Hwy 101 in Oregon.  Just what we were looking for!  Picked up few other informational items on Oregon also.  After a stroll through the campground we made supper on the grill and then took our showers and worked on this journal and some other daily stuff that has to be done.  It is quite windy in our camping area, we noticed, but not in the other areas of the campground.  The beach is really close and that may have something to do with it.  Brookings is known as the Oregon Coast's Banana Belt.  It benefits from weather patterns that give it the warmest average temperatures on the Oregon coast.  It is the gateway to Oregon and home to an increasing number of retirees.  The Brookings area produces about 75 percent of the Easter Lilies grown in the United States, and vast fields of these beautiful white flowers can be seen in early July and I guess we are going to miss them.  They ship them all over the world.  If Harris Beach SP is any indication of what the rest of Oregon's State Parks are like, we will be quite pleased.  This is one of the only State Parks we have seen that has laundry facilities. 

   We all made plans to attend a dinner and show here at the campground at 6 p.m. at the Black Forest Restaurant.  They only serve one meal to everyone who makes a reservation and there is a show included.  It should be fun.  After letting our friends know we were here and drinking a couple of tall, cold glasses of Crystal Light, that they provided, we set-up our tent and relaxed before dinner.  We met at 5:30 p.m. at their RV.  The Lazy Daze RV Group was also there for the dinner and show.  We had met some of them earlier when they had stopped by to look at our trikes.  Dinner was excellent.  We had steak and wurst and baked potato with salad and bread.     The show was the owner singing traditional German Oktoberfest songs with some older American songs thrown in.  He included the audience quite a bit and told some jokes that were silly but quite funny.  Before and after we ate there was music played by a guy named Lee.  Several couples from the RV Group were dancing.  Afterwards we returned to our tent and retired for the evening.  We were tired. 
   It was a wonderful panoramic view of the ocean.  Took pictures and headed back into town.  Made a stop for us at the grocery store for a few items.  Then headed back towards the campground with a stop at the local Gold Beach Cat Houses.  It was a group of miniature houses where stray cats are fed and are able to stay out of the cold and rain.           It was certainly interesting. Returned to the campground and Joni and Frank made us tacos.  They were great.  After we ate they rested and we took showers and did our laundry and we rested a little, too.  Around 5 p.m. we talked a little more and then we went to the Black Forest Restaurant for the dinner and show again.  We had bratwurst and chicken and red cabbage and potato pancakes and bread.  It was excellent.     Watched the first half of the show and then had to get ready for bed.  Said our see you laters to our friends and hit the hay.  It was a really nice day. 
   One of the first things we passed this morning was Prehistoric Gardens.  Here they have lifesize replicas of dinosaurs in a rain forest-like atmosphere.  You could see a couple of them along the side of the road as we went by.  We rode only a short distance today to Humbug Mountain State Park.  Real nice park.  We got everything set-up and went volksmarching!  It was on Humbug Mountain Trail.  3 miles up to 1748 ft and 3 miles back down. Humbug Mountain is the highest peak along the coast of Oregon.  Great walk with a beautiful view at the top.      We ate lunch at the top, then returned to our campsite and relaxed for a short time and then did the Oregon Coast Trail Volksmarch that starts here also.  The guide we have says Humbug Mountain Trail is a challenging walk and the Coastal Trail is a moderate walk to give you an idea of their difficulty.  These were our first volksmarches in Oregon and our first hiking experience in Oregon also.  We rested for a while and then took our showers and fixed supper.  During supper some friends of ours showed up.  Mel and Miko from Las Vegas.  They are on their way to Washington to start a long-distance cycle tour with Miko sagging him.  He is going all the way across the USA this summer.  We talked for awhile and then all said goodnight because we are all getting up early in the morning.  Finished this journal entry and relaxed before hitting the sack.  It was a nice day.  Had several other bikers in the camp tonight.    

   The fog was rolling in so we turned around after we were within a mile and stopped in the picnic area and ate lunch.  Met some people here who we talked to for a little while about our trip.  Then headed back to our campsite and relaxed the rest of the day after eating supper and completing other chores.  Met two cyclists from Canada tonight.  Talked to them awhile by our campfire. 
Attracted by gold, fishing and lumber, the first settlers arrived at the Coquille Valley in 1853.  As late as 1886 there wasn't so much as a wagon road between the Coquille River and Coos Bay, only about 30 miles apart. Transportation and communication between the communities depended upon waterways. The geographic location of Bandon at the mouth of the Coquille River made it the hub of all river transportation.  Inbound merchandise and passengers were transferred from their ocean-going vessels to riverboats for delivery to upstream destinations.  Valley farm products and outbound travelers were transferred at Bandon for their journeys to other ports.  Dozens of boats would be in the harbor at a time, loading and unloading freight and lumber. But shoals at the mouth of the river made the bar entrance unpredictable.  If the entrance to the Coquille River was to be of any real commercial use, jetties were essential.  In 1887 the south jetty was built.  Dredging created a depth of 10-12 feet at high tide, but shoaling continued to be a problem. In 1888 a report published by U.S. Engineers contemplated improvements at the mouth of the river; a lighthouse and a jetty on the north side were requirements. Finally, in 1891, Congress appropriated $50,000 for the construction of the Coquille River Light Station, the last to be built on the Oregon Coast.  A local engineer interceded, however, and designated some of those funds for repair to the Point Gregory Lighthouse at Cape Arago.  The Coquille River Lighthouse was built four years later for only $17,600...the smallest lighthouse on the Oregon Coast. The lighthouse reserve included 11 acres, including Rackleff Rock, the island on which the lighthouse was built.  It was connected to the mainland by a footbridge until 1905, when the north jetty was completed and the channel filled in to connect the island to the mainland. The light station went into service on February 29, 1896 with Lightkeeper James Barker in charge.  He and his assistant, James Cowan, along with their families, shared a large duplex 1/10th of a mile north of the lighthouse.  The head keeper earned $800 per year; his assistant $650.  If equipment was lost due to negligence, it was docked from their pay. Families of the lightkeepers had chores to do, too, but were not compensated for their labors.  Women rowed their children across the river to go to school.  During a storm at night, family members often went on 4-hour shifts in the tower to make sure the light did not blow out.  Lighthouse inspectors were notorious for surprise inspections, and women were required to keep their quarters as clean and polished as the lighthouse. The Coquille River Lighthouse presents a relatively simple exterior due to the small scale of the structure, and resembles characteristics of the High Victorian Italianiate style.  On average, it is 10 to 15 feet from the base of the structure to the water below.  The tower measures 47 feet from its base. The lightroom was equipped with a Fourth-Order Fresnel Lens, illuminated by a Funck Heap lamp, and was visible 12 miles at sea on a clear night.  The orders refer to the size of the lens, a first order being the largest.  The signal beam was on for 28 seconds, off 2 seconds, signifying that it was a "Harbor Light".  There were shutters that came across in front of the light for the 2-second occlusion, operated by a clock mechanism similar to a grandfather clock. The fog horn was a DaBoll Trumpet, which used steam to generate the blast.  Its signature was a blast of 5 seconds, followed by a silent interval of 25 seconds.  It was replaced by a fog siren in 1910. The lighthouse provided safer river conditions, which stimulated the local economy.  By 1910 Bandon had 5 sawmills, a woolen mill, 2 shipyards, a creamery, and a pair of canneries. In 1914, fire destroyed the business district in Bandon. Another fire in 1936 devastated Bandon, leaving only 16 of the existing 500 buildings.  The lighthouse played a significant role in the 1936 fire, directing light across the river to aid the fire-fighting.  They provided water and shelter to survivors and homeless.  The ships' radios provided the only source of communication with the outside world. By 1939, technical navigational apparatus was commonplace and there was no longer a need for marine beacons, foghorns, and lightkeepers.  The Coast Guard extinguished the light at the Coquille River Lighthouse and replaced it with an unwatched automated beacon at the end of the south jetty.  It signified the end of an era.  The light was removed from the tower and the lighthouse was abandoned.  The lighthouse, the lightkeeper's house and outbuildings succumed to neglect, severe weather and vandalism.  While standing in the tower, it was easy to imagine what it was like to be out there on the tiny little island, alone in a severe storm, with waves crashing all around.  Not something I would want to do.  Rode back to the campground and had lunch.  Walked around the campground and worked on the journal and read our books before taking our showers.  Almost everyone in the campground packed up and left by noon.  What a quiet place it was for us until the new batch of campers arrived.  Visited with the camp hosts and the resident turkey hen before having dinner.  After dinner we sat by a campfire.  There are several cyclists here tonight, but they did not camp in the cyclists camp area.  It is a rather small area for so many tents.  The weather was good most of the day and got cold and windy in the evening as it does most nights. 

                       This park is the former estate of a lumber baron, and contains one of the oldest formal gardens in Oregon.  The roses now growing in the garden are truly beautiful, as are the ocean views from the grounds. 
     
We are staying just on the outskirts of the Oregon Dunes National Recreation Area.  Most wonder how all this sand came to "rest" in this 40-mile section of the Oregon Coast.  Geologisits are still unraveling the story of the dunes.  To date, research indicates that the Oregon Dunes are part of a hugh sand dune sheet that begins in southern California and reaches into Washington.  Most of the sand dune sheet is not visible, covered by vegetation and developments. Over millions of years, glaciers reduced mountains to sand.  Rivers picked up the sand and carried it to the ocean.  The force of the ocean waves, and strong winds brought the sand ashore along the entire coastline.  The sand is exposed in this area (7 miles north of Lakeside) allowing us to see the enormous dunes.  The KOA we are staying in has a private entrance to the recreation  area and practically everyone staying here has ATV's with paddle wheels for running in the sand.  We are staying here today for rest and relaxation.  We did take a walk to see the dunes area.  No big deal.  We didn't even take a picture.  It might be impressive to someone who has never seen a sand dune. 
       Our stop for the night ended up not being much further up the road.  Honeyman State Park Bicyclist Camp.  Got set-up and went to the camp store for Gatorade and sunflower seeds.  Came back to our campsite and took showers and had supper and relaxed the rest of the evening. 



       Then we talked some and returned to our tent and worked on this journal and read and a few other things, all the while it was raining fairly hard. In the evening around 6 p.m. there was a Bluegrass Music Concert at the Hospitality Yurt, which was across the street from our tent.     It lasted for 2 and a half hours.  It was a bit like country music, but it all sounded the same to us, sort of like somebody skinning a cat. It was so cold tonight that we could see our breath.  We decided to skip the fireworks because of the cold. 
   We got up early this morning and walked into town to make our library internet appointment.  As we were walking we discussed our new plan.  Made a stop at a local camping supply store to look for a new cook pot. They didn't have any.  Also made a stop at a huge kite and flag store.  Never seen anything like it.  They had "professional" kites!  Saw the Community College and decided to check and see what internet access they offered.  Just what we were looking for.  We could use it immediately, and for as long as we needed to.  So, we both began updating our website.  Bill started with the journal and got me started on uploading our photos into Zing.  What a job. It took us almost 2 hours as usual, even with both of us working simultaneously.  Left the college library and headed to the town library.  Here we were able to pick up some used books for free.  Headed back to the state park with a stop at U-Haul to rent a truck to get all our gear back to Victorville, CA.  No problem.  We loaded up all our gear.  We also gave two other cyclists a ride, along with their gear, as far south as Florence.        They had gotten a late start also, due to the noise last night and the uncertainty of the weather.  We dropped them off at a laundramat and headed inland towards Eugene, OR and I-5, going south.  The weather was warmer, but partly cloudy.  Stopped for the night around 7:30 p.m. at Sunny Valley KOA near Grants Pass, Oregon.  We drove around 230 miles today.  We didn't leave Newport, OR until almost 1 p.m.  Not long after we parked the truck it began to pour, so we decided to sleep in the back of the truck instead of setting up our tent.  We set out our blue tarp and put our sleeping mats and sleeping bags on top of it.  Then we went and took showers and did the laundry and it was already 9:30 p.m.  What a long but exciting day! 
     Both were beautiful.  The mountain had tons of snow on it.  We saw many mountains today with lots of snow on them.  It warmed up nicely as we headed south.  It is the first time in the last three months we were able to go coatless!  It feels real good.  We made many stops for food and gas and breaks. 

   Look for our next trip, beginning on June 30, 2002! 

Departure; not only from Newbury, NH but also from the ranks of normal people who use things like words to say what they mean... Was I ever among the normal people? I thought not. In case you weren't all aware, it's Tuesday October, 9. Two years to the day since I met my sweetheart Kimberly (Hi Kim, hope you have a special day!). Today I roll for Ascutney, VT. It's not far, but my hospitalized brother is getting moved there. I'll visit the wounded one more time as I leave (that's you Dustin). I hope to make Hazleton, PA (Hi, what's for dinner?) in a little over a week. From there, it's on to Indiana (consider yourself warned). Who knows how long that will take? My beloved sister was kind enough to park her house right on the East side for the Appalachian Mountains (thanks sis).  May God bless you All,  Ben  Lipstick: "These things transpired because love exceeded words."  I waited until noon for my brother to be transported to Ascutney, but the hospital canceled his move. I rode, instead, towards Kim's family in Burlington, VT. My first camping spot was a gravel pit  70 miles from my start. I was happy with the day considering my late start and the mountainous terrain. In fact, I began to think that I might be able to ride more than my estimated five hundred miles a week. Of course I was fresh  and foolish.






































Kelty Clark Tent I began to wonder if the person who named this tent purposely spoofed "Clark Kent".  It's a remarkable piece of gear and weighs only 3 lbs.  It's not a free standing design, but it's light and bombproof. Speedplay Pedals I love them because I've had knee problems in the past and they allow my feet to pivot freely. I hate them because it's a high maintenance pedal system.  I had to stop and clean out my cleats on several occasions and broke one of the  springs before all was said and done. B.O.B Yak Trailer I have nothing but praise for this trailer. I could not have used my Specialized M4 on this trip without it. Next Mini Pump It's almost a good design but poor quality. I needed a pump that could give me 130 psi in my back tire and this pump was advertised to be capable of 150 psi.  I promptly broke the hinge pin in the handle and later had a problem with the check valve. It was priced lower than similar pumps but not worth the savings.  It's not the type of thing you want to ride through the desert with.
Laying your bed roll down under the tent allows you to test the spot for comfort and saves the floor of your tent from damage by sharp stuff. Truck stops are from heaven. They have showers, cheap buffets, and don't mind if you camp out back. Routing I used a standard road atlas (sans the extra pages of states I wouldn't be passing through) and plotted my route according to my needs based on rumors, rivers, trains, and expected traffic.  Water doesn't go up hill and trains have a tough time with hills too. The wind blows out of the South West 90% of the time. Cycling I made it with 4 water bottles (in November).  Some towns on your map in NM don't exist, so be careful and ask the locals. The longest stretch I had between water stops was about 80 miles. The sun sets in the West and makes it hard for motorists to see you in the afternoon if you're going the same way.  This is a good time to call on the power of prayer and/or get off the road. I didn't need to be as obsessed about weight as I was.  The trip may have been more comfortable if I had brought a normal pair of shoes.  Heavy stuff might slow you down, but broken stuff can stop you! (My trailer weighed 40 lbs. loaded.) Saddle sores... I found that using antibacterial wipes for a long time ( I was putting them in my shorts while riding at times) helped but I eventually developed a rash (presumably this was the cause).

I had to race along the B3297 to find another post office; there was one in Wendron, but though the shop was open, the post office section was firmly closed. I finally arrived in Redruth   and got to the post office ten minutes before it shut. This TIC also had no information on Truro (now10 miles away) and so I decide to spend the night in Redruth. The weather report showed torrential rain all over the Southwest, but for me the day was hot and sunny.  Total today   70.0 miles  Trip total       72.0 miles

Just before Bude, I had my second puncture. I repaired it, but it blew again. For some reason, my computer stopped working at the same time. In Bude, I found an open bike shop, so I bought a new tube and fitted it. Half a mile further, I checked the pressure at a garage, and the new tube blew. Closer inspection revealed that I had a small split in the tyre wall, so I had to walk back to the bike shop to replace tube and tyre. All this cost me a good two hours. I rode through Holdsworthy - it was shut - and about 6.00 pm checked my CTC list of accommodation I found a place in Great Torrington, so I set off again down the Tarka Trail. The guesthouse was excellent. Went down the Black Horse for something to eat and fell into conversation with a garrulous 35ish karaoke DJ with a 17 year old partner who was still studying for her A levels. She served me my dinner.It was here that I first noticed problems with my hands caused by gripping the bars all day long.

I scared myself silly because I looked at the map and decided that I could cross the A40 between Shilton and Asthall. When I got there, there was no crossing and I had no choice but to join this main, motorway standard road. I managed about 200m on it, then carried the bike across a ditch, threw it over a fence, and jumped after it onto a service road at the side. Fortunately, this crossed the road with a bridge, so I escaped. I took the main A4095 between Witney and Bicester. I ended the day in Bicester, not being able to face another forty miles into Luton (it would have been dark long before I got there anyway, and I carried no lights). The only B&B in the town was very average and expensive, but I was too knackered to argue. Total today  105.2  miles Trip Total    495.4  miles

I stopped at the caf next to the TIC for tea and walnut cake, then set off for the long drag up to Tan Hill. I?d ridden that one before, but had forgotten just what a serious drag it is. Even when you get to the top, there is a series of smaller, energy sapping undulations which carry on past the pub. By this time, the weather had become really hot. I coasted down into Kirkby Stephen and, there being no cafes open, stopped for drink at the hotel opposite the market place. Orange squash and soda costs 40p a pint there! I couldn?t believe it, but had another half to celebrate. I tried to book my own B&B in Appleby without success, so I went back into the TIC and they booked it for me. Another  ?gently undulating? 10 miles saw me into Appleby in Westmorland. It?s a pleasant small town, but to call it a ?county town? is as big a joke as calling St. David?s a city. The B&B was pleasant, but I had the smallest room I?ve ever been offered, about 3m x 1.2m. Still, it was adequate. I walked into town, and had pie, chips and peas in the caf by the bridge. It was a stiflingly hot night. Total today                             88.54    miles Distance from Land?s End  1037.7     miles     
I chose my route that morning to take me by the Long Meg stone circle, but about a hundred metres from the entrance, a foot & mouth sign stopped me, so onward through ?gently undulating? countryside to Bampton, and collapsed into the Caper Tree caf for lunch. I used the TIC to find a B&B in Johnstonebridge, six miles north of Lockerbie.Feeling much better after soup and cake, I set off across country to Longtown (which has the most wonderful hardware shop), then onto Lockerbie. Somewhere along this stretch, I passed into Scotland, and then alongside the M74 to Johnstonebridge. Mrs. Harper, who runs the B&B is a chef, and I had one of the best meals of the trip. Total today                               76.39 miles Distance from Land?s End                1114.1    miles   
At this point my second saviour of the day arrived in the form of another cyclist who stopped. He cheerfully informed me that the nearest bike shop was in New Lanark, about 30 miles on. He then gave me his spare tube (kept in a washing up liquid bottle in his bottle cage) - much patched, but patched correctly in the old fashioned way. It lasted me until Lakhall, and definitely saved the day, and probably the whole trip. I decided not to go for New Lanark, but to stay en route into Glasgow. I knew that I?d be passing through a number of towns and villages, any of which might have a bike shop. During the afternoon, my bottle cage also snapped, and the top of my drinks bottle broke. After this, I had no other breakdown or mishap during the rest of the trip.  In the event, I had to ride another 40 miles into Larkhall before I found a bike shop, and it was a good one. J.G.Campbell of Pro-Am Cycles fixed the front changer for me, and, after some discussion, fitted Continental tyres front and rear, sold me new tubes, bottle cage, decent puncture repair outfit and tyre levers. Sorted! I made it into Central Glasgow. I have never entered any city before where on a Saturday afternoon people were vomiting, fighting, and crying hysterically openly on the streets. Is this what they mean by ?City of Culture?? By 5.15 I was at the TIC. I couldn?t think of leaving the bike outside, so I took it in with me. There was a notice inside informing us that owing to the Robbie Williams concert that weekend, there was virtually no accommodation available in central Glasgow. This didn?t worry me particularly, and I got booked into a B&B in Milngavie, North of Glasgow. There are two pubs I n Milngavie, but they were both too hot and noisy for me, so I ended up eating in McDonalds! Total today                            73.86 miles Distance from Land?s End             1188.0 miles   
The early part of the day gave some good cycling (and some fierce hills). Past Aberfoyle, the forest paths were closed, so I had to climb the hill on the A821. At the top of the pass, the forest drive started, so I went to look at it, and decided that I much preferred the fast road downhill. I stopped at Brig O?Turk for soup and carrot cake, then joined the off road path along Loch Lubnaig. There were some lousy surfaces on this track, and I came off for the first and only time of this trip, on a slippery wooden bridge so I decided to cross the river and take the main A85 to Killin I eventually found the B&B, and went off looking for somewhere to eat. Everywhere was either fully booked, far too hot and noisy (they seem to like their pubs that way in Scotland) or had finished serving food. I ended up at the chippy van. It had an amazingly extensive menu for such a small van, so I eventually went for what seemed to be the lowest fat option - smoked sausage and chips. She took a 20cm length of what looked like radiator hose out of the freezer, and dropped it in the deep fat fryer. It turned out to be delicious. Whilst I was waiting for it to cook, the next guy in the line ordered a pizza. Out came a 10-inch cheese and tomato, straight into the fryer. The next woman ordered a meat pie. It went in there too. They like their fries in Scotland Total today                               79.12  miles Distance from Land?s End                1267.1    miles       
Total Today                            84.52  miles Distance from Land?s End  1351.6   miles     
I set off through the Black Isle, and as I approached Fortrose, I overtook a young German cyclist with full camping gear. He?d been on the road for three weeks. He was the only other touring cyclist I met until I got to the signpost at John O?Groats. On the way down the hill into Cromerty, I started to panic that the Nigg Ferry would not be running for some reason. When I reached the town, it was deserted, and there was no indication that the ferry even existed, but eventually, I found the place and caught the penultimate ferry of the day. The route took us past oilrigs in the Firth. Chatting to the deck hand, it turned out that the Cromerty Rose was for sale, and service likely to be discontinued. It?s a great pity, but not unreasonable as I was the only passenger on that journey, there had been no one on the trip towards me, and no one was waiting on the other side. The deck hand said that it never really got busy. There are good road links from Inverness to Tain along the other side of the Cromerty Firth (but not for cyclists). I got into Tain at 18.45 and ate in my room. Total Today                             88.97 miles Distance from Land?s End              1440.6  miles       
Stopped for tea and biscuits in Bora, and carried on to the Laidhay Croft Museum for soup. I met the steepest hill of the trip that morning, and had to push the bike up Berridale Braes, I should think well over half a mile. I hadn?t pushed the bike more than about two hundred metres in total before that. Made it into Wick against the grinding headwind by about 15.30, and went straight to the station. Because the computer was down, I was told to come back tomorrow. On to John O?Groats. It was a painfully slow ride (did I mention that there was a headwind?) BUT I MADE IT. Booked into the Seaview Hotel and went down to the harbour to take the obligatory photos. Had a good meal, and celebrated with 12 and 32 year old whiskeys. Total today                                 87.30 miles Trip total                                   578.74 miles Distance from Land?s End  1527.9   miles         
Booked a B&B in Inverness, then wandered round Wick for most of the day. It doesn't take long. Went to the Caithness Glass factory. When I caught the train, I had to leave the bike in the tender care of a white van driver, but he did seem to have some respect for the bike, and it was waiting for me in Inverness. Caught the train with no trouble in the morning and arrived in York at about 14.15.

However, if you believe as I do that everyone has to ride their own ride, read on.  I have prefaced each actual riding day with an asterisk, so you can skip over the rest if you wish.
  We are truly getting antsy to begin this trip.  This morning we loaded up the trikes and Sammie's trailer and rode to Junction Bicycle in East Mesa.  Junction Bicycle is helping sponsor this trip.  This was just a shake-down trip, just to see how the loaded trailer would track behind Bill's bike.  We had no problems with the trailer, even though it seems to track about 1 or 2 inches left of center.  Bill thinks that may be because the back wheel on the trike is offset by about that much.  The ride was not bad, but the temperature was over 100 degrees by 10 a.m.

 If our rig had been any taller or longer we would have had to pay $10 extra for an escort.  As we exited the long tunnel we saw two elk on the side of the road.  One had a large rack.  When you enter one end of the long tunnel and then exit the other, the landscape changes dramatically.     On one side is Zion Canyon with its massive cliff walls and on the other side is slickrock country.  The first mountain we saw as we entered the south end of the park was the sandstone Checkerboard Mesa.  It is the most prominent example of naturally sculptured rock art.  We didn't take the 90 minute shuttle ride up the scenic drive because we have Sammie with us and it was too hot to leave her in the RV since we could not run the generator to run the air conditioning.  We did take time to visit the visitors' center.  We parked in the shade and turned the fan on.  Sammie was fine and is doing much better today overall.  Zion National Park was established in 1909 as Mukuntuweap National Monument and then was expanded in 1919 as Zion National Park.  The scenery can be found nowhere else on earth.  The sandstone cliffs are among the highest in the world.  The park is 229 sq miles.  The name Zion is a Hebrew word referring to a place of safety or refuge. It was name by Mormon pioneers in the 1860s. For lunch we stopped at an Historical site in Fillmore, UT and had a picnic under a tree. Sammie enjoyed this the most.  A little bit of lunchmeat here and a little bit of cheese there and a gulp or two of ice and soda for her.  Paid for two nights at Utah Lake State Park.  Immediately unloaded our bikes and hit the bike trail.  The Provo River Parkway trail runs right beside where our RV is parked. We rode the short section and saved the longer part for tomorrow.  We rode around the park and along a nearby country road into town and back.  The payphone in the park is not working so we were unable to use our pocketmail machine.
            


 These fish are commonly found throughout the Columbia and Snake Rivers.  They like deep, cavernous areas and are bottom feeders.  They are grey in color, with bony plates along their backs and can live up to 100 years.  They can grow to 20 feet long and weigh up to 1,800 lbs.  Some of the other fish we saw were: Salmon, Steelhead, Shad and Lamprey.  We also went to the actual dam area and viewed the fish ladders.  Here we saw fish counters.  We decided that had to be a hard and boring job.  The Bonneville Lock and Dam is located in the Columbia River Gorge National Scenic Area 40 miles east of Portland. It forms a connecting link between the two states of OR and WA.  It was built and operated by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and was the first of eight federal locks and dams on the Columbia and Snake Rivers.  Total construction cost was $88.4 million.  Our next stop was Horsetail Falls and then Multnomah Falls.    Both places were very crowded.  We walked the trail up to the bridge across the falls.  Multnomah Falls, at 620 feet, is the fifth highest waterfall in the U.S., and the second highest year-round waterfall in the U.S.  We stayed on the old Historic Columbia River Highway when we could.  Our last stop on this highway was the Vista House.    Here we had a wonderful view of the gorge and surrounding areas.    Originally built in 1918, it is currently under renovation and won't be completed until 2004.  After this stop we headed into Portland and went to Powell's City Of Books.  This bookstore was certainly the biggest one we have ever been in.  It had used and new books, hard cover and paperbacks all on the same shelves.  It is open 365 days a year.  They have 6 stores in the Portand area.  From here we headed to the Portland airport to pick up Sharon, Harry's wife.  We made it just in time. We then went to the restaurant Sweet Tomatoes in Vancouver for dinner.  Last stop was the fireworks show in Hood River.  We stayed on the WA side and watched the fireworks across the water. Got back to the RV at 11 p.m. and immediately went to bed.  We sure had a fun-filled day. 
 Didn't get on the trail until 11 a.m. Sammie declined to join us.  She wanted to stay and play with her new dog and cat friends.  It was funny.  For once she is actually acting like a dog.  The hike was very nice.  Not too streneous.  We hiked out about 2 hours and then returned.    We also hid a microcache out there that we are calling Pacific Crest Trail Adventure.  On the way back we noticed that a fire had broken out on Dog Mountain on Hwy 14 in the Gorge. The road was closed and they were searching for 10 hikers up there.  We had discussed hiking that trail before we decided on the PCT.  It is closer to where we are staying.  Hopefully the fire will not spread our way.  The winds are not blowing much today, fortunately.  We are tired of fires.  Returned home and relaxed the rest of the day.  We are tired from our hike.  The day could not have been nicer weather-wise.  There are many wildflowers in bloom also.   

The first hint of trouble came on March 20, 1980, when the mountain gave a violent shudder of 4.1 on the Richter needle.  Then, on March 27, the first eruption opened a crater and sent a plume of ash and steam 7,000 feet into the air.  Quake followed quake in the next few weeks.  A major eruption was predicted at this point.  Everyone who lived and worked in the area found these predictions hard to believe.  They had been warned.  Finally, on a clear Sunday morning in May, the mountain blew. We were on the road to Mount St. Helen by 8:30 a.m.  Got half way down the mountain and Harry realized he had forgotten his wallet, so we turned around and went back and got it.  We had taken Sammie with us, but decided to leave her at home when we returned for the wallet.  She wasn't doing too well on the mountain roads.  Headed back out again.  We took the scenic route which was windy and curvy, with hairpin turns all the way.  Jan immediately became car sick.  We all switched seats several different times until Jan ended up in the front seat and Sharon was driving.  Dakota went with us and was fine the entire ride.  He was a very well-behaved dog.  We went to the north-east side of the mountain where the explosion occured.  We saw Spirit Lake, where Harry Truman stayed with his lodge and was buried completely, and the destroyed car from some people who were staying in a cabin nearby.  There were destroyed trees laying all over the place along with new growth.  We stopped at the Ranger Station Visitor's Center and looked over the displays and watched a 25 minute movie about the explosion.  At the mountain vista we took pictures and attended the ranger's talk.  It was very windy and cold at the top.  There was snow all around.  We headed back home after having our picnic lunch.  The drive back was 100% better for Jan especially.  Started raining and storming on our way back to our friends' house.  Stopped for dinner at All Sports Pizza in Bingen, WA. Returned home and relaxed the rest of the evening.  Sammie and all the other animals were scared and hiding most of the evening because of the storm.
At 9 a.m. we made a stop for gas, snacks and breakfast at the Super Wal-Mart in Kennewick, WA.  After that stop we made a stop for chocolate at the chocolate factory on I-395.  Figured this would get us in for sure at our friends Karen and Jay's!  No one can resist chocolate.  Arrived at Karen and Jay's at 1 p.m.  They live in a small farming community of 1700 people. Their county (Lincoln)is the 2nd largest wheat producing area in the country.  They are 35 miles west of Spokane.  After the reunion Bill went with Jay to mow grass at the apt complex they manage.  Jan and Karen went walking to downtown.  They went to the post office and the pharmacy, which is basically the everything store.  Nice short walk.  We all met back at the house and headed into Spokane.  First stop was REI to get Bill a pair of pants to replace the ones the zipper came off of yesterday.  Found some in the "attic" there which means they were half price.  Then we parked and walked through the Riverfront park.  We saw the Spokane Falls, the Louff Carousel, the big Radio Flyer Wagon and many other things.  Went to see Men In Black 2 at River Park Square Theatre.  We all enjoyed the movie.  The dog stole the show.  We were shocked at how cheep it was to get in.  It was only $7.50 for both of us!  After the movie we all had dinner at the Olive Garden.  It was excellent as always.  Returned to the van through the park and took a different route back to Davenport.  After we got back to their house Bill sifted through all our AOL mail.  75 messages!  Jan got the guest room ready by bringing in all our "luggage".  Finished up the journal and whatnot and finally hit the sack sometime after 11 p.m.  Totally beat.
After our bike ride we rearranged our trailer to load one of our trikes and Jay and Karen's recumbents.  Bill's trike will go on the roof of their van so we can all go riding the Centennial Trail tomorrow. Had supper and then headed out to the Grand Coulee Dam.  It was a 50 mile drive.  Our friends took us the back way in and the straight route out.  Jay drove really slow around all the curves so Jan wouldn't get car sick.  It worked!  We arrived at the dam a little early so we stopped at a 50's diner and had ice cream. The Grand Coulee Dam is the largest hydro power producer in the U.S.A. with a capacity of 6,809 megawatts and third largest in the world.  The dam is considered one of the largest concrete structures on earth.  It contains almost 12,000,000 cubic yards of concrete, which is enough concrete to build a sidewalk 4 feet wide and 4 inches thick, 50,000 miles long, or twice around the equater.  Or, you could build a highway from Seattle, WA to Miami, FL and back! The Grand Coulee Dam has 3 times more concrete than the Hoover Dam and produces 3 times as much electricity.  However, the Hoover Dam is 176 feet higher than the Grand Coulee Dam. We specifically went to see the 10 p.m. Laser Light Show.  We heard about this show from our cyclist friend Mark who rode through here a few weeks ago.  The Dam is transformed into one of the largest screens in the world.  The massive spillway gates open and sheets of white water blanket the face of the dam.  The show was narrated and told of the history of the river, the events leading to the construction of the dam, and the benefits of electrical power, irrigation and recreation that electrical power has produced.  Accompanying the narration were fanciful free-form patterns in many brillant colors that danced across the face of the dam. There was also background music by Neil Diamond and Vangelis. It lasted 36 minutes. The lasers came out of an enclosed glass projection booth located inside the Visitors' Center.  A digital audio tape controls all the equipment and timing for the show.  The lasers are low-intensity lasers.  Because of their low-intensity, no damage is done to the surface of the dam.  The images we saw were 500 to 1000 dots which were scanned in sequence, connecting them to produce still images or cell.  The cells were projected on the face of the dam at approximately 24 cells per second, which we saw as galloping horses, jumping fish and eagles soaring across the front of the dam. We took our lounge chairs and had front row seats just outside the visitor center.  The show was awesome.  Believe it or not it was FREE too!  It was definitely a memorable experience.  There were 1000s of people there.  We returned to Karen and Jay's after we were able to get out of the parking lot. Didn't get home until after midnight.

After resting most of the afternoon we headed to the Two Rivers Casino, located on the Spokane Indian Reservation 25 miles away.  We all had the $5.99 Prime Rib Dinner special.  After dinner Jan watched Jay gamble and Bill and Karen read books in lounge chairs down by the river.  This arrangement lasted less than an hour and we headed home.  On the way we hid another Geocache on the bottom of an old broken down wagon near a convenience store.  Forgot to mention hiding a Geocache along the Centennial Trail yesterday.  It was found already today.  That is good.  All the caches we have hidden on our trip have been found.  Decided to stay with our friends Jay and Karen one more day and spend it geocaching.  There aren't as many to choose from here as in Arizona, but it will be just as much fun, we are sure.  Watched the movie Coyote Ugly and hit the sack.
Was up and out of the house by 7:30 a.m. to go Geocaching.  The first cache we found was "Battle Of Four Lakes".  It was a film canister with a log sheet to sign that was hidden at the base of an historical monument.  We found it at 8:08 a.m.  Easy find.  Headed off to "John A. Finch Arboretum" Cache.  Parked and went off through the grass the direction the GPS took us.  Beautiful park. Found the cache hidden under a bridge in a creek at 8:58 a.m.  It was an ammo box.  Another fairly easy find.  This Finch Arboretum occupies about 65 acres of beautiful tree-covered land along Garden Springs Creek in the southwest part of Spokane.  We saw lots of marmots and gophers on the grounds as we walked.  Just had to stop for coffee and danish at Cabin Creek Coffee, then headed out to find "Manitou Ugly Duckling" cache.  It was in Manitou City Park.  First stop in the park on the way was Gaiser Conservatory.  The plants were beautiful.  Found the cache in a small tupperware container at 10:25 a.m.  Took a shell and left nothing since we left our trade item in the car.  This cache was hard to find because the coordinates were off by 75 feet.  Next cache we went for was "Minnehaha" which was in a park by the same name.  Man, this was a steep hike up a mountain to the top and it was scorching hot.  Found the cache at 11:15 without much trouble.  Signed the log and headed back down to air conditioning.  Next stop was Viewpoint #3 on the Centennial Trail.  We had to find out how many square miles the aquifer covers.  The answer was 135 miles. We rode this trail two days ago.  It is a State Park with a 372 acre day use park, that is 37 miles long.  It is a paved trail that meanders along the Spokane River extendng from Nine Mile Falls to the Idaho state line.  However, it doesn't stop here but extends another 20 miles or so to Lake Coeur d'Alene. The trail has 42 historical and archaelogical sites, most of which remain to be marked. The trail was dedicated and named the Centennial Trail in 1989, in commemoration of Washington state's 100th birthday that year. All the planned caches were found so we went touring.  First stop was the Arbor Crest Wine Cellar.  It is a long-established winery of international prominence.  The home of Arbor Crest, the Cliff House, is a national historic landmark.  Perched on a commanding rock promontory, the estate rises 450 ft above the winding Spokane River.  We had a wonderful panoramic view of the surrounding countryside.  There was a giant checker board on the grounds.  It was neat.  The flowers all around were really nice also.  We saw the Riblet Square Wheel Tractor here, too.  It was made in 1924.  The promotional description was that it fits any make and size of tractor.  Doubles the drawbar twice faster.  Works in any soil and mud or snow.  Goes any speed on pavement. Needs no lubrication.  It was certainly interesting. Did a driving tour and then stopped by the mall for a late lunch.  Jay got his hair cut.  We thought about going to the movies, but the wait for the next one was too long.  We had to make a stop for Krispy Kreme donuts.  We were able to snag two free ones, each!  We went for a scenic drive back to Jay and Karen's and we all made cool drinks and relaxed.  Recorded all our caches and worked on the journal and got everything mostly packed for our trip tomorrow heading to the coast of Oregon.  We are hoping it will be much cooler there.
Took a couple of other rest stops along the way.  Arrived in Newport, Oregon at 5 p.m. and the South Beach State Park Campground was full.  Spoke with the head ranger about our trip and he said no problem about getting us in a site.  We could stay in the Hiker/biker camp for two nights, but have to park the RV and trailer across the street in overflow.  We paid the same price as a primative campsite.  This all was just fine with us.  Set-up our tent and started putting our gear together.  What a job we have ahead of us to organize all the stuff we need to have with us.  We are just happy at this point to have a place to stay. Met several other bikers and actually had dinner with one at our RV.  He is a school teacher from Maine. Tomorrow the plan is to geocache in the morning and do our final packing of the bike bags and trailer in the afternoon.
Even though we didn't get to sleep until late we were up by 6 a.m. and on our way geocaching.  The first one "Billy Goats Gruff" was hidden right at the base of the bridge Jan doesn't like.  We found and signed the log book at 6:22 a.m. The next one, "Agate Cache" we could not find.  The area was trampled like something may have been there at one time.  Oh, well off to the next one.  "Angels 7" was the name of this next cache.  We had to walk down 97 steps to the beach and then walk along the beach for 1/4th of a mile and then back up 8 steps.  We did find the cache.  It was very cleverly hidden inside a tree. Sometimes it is nice to have a challenge.  Returned to the RV by the same route.  It was 7:48 a.m. when we found this one and signed the log.  Bill found a Where's Geoge dollar bill in this cache.  The next one was a disappointment - "View By The Bay".  We found what we thought was the cache, because it was marked as such.  However, it seems someone has stolen this cache and in its place they left something disgusting for cachers to find.  Needless to say, Bill and I threw it away.  Hopefully, the owner will replace this cache.  So, we headed off to the next cache nearby at the Oregon Coast Aquarium.  It was called "Enchanted Seas".  This one is sponsored by the Aquarium and was the first one we have ever seen locked up.  Took a travel bug and left some quarters.  Forgot our trade item! Went bike riding when we got back to the park.  We rode the trails in the park all the way back to the aquarium and then down a couple of local country roads. We rode a couple of different times throughout the day, to include all the camping loops A-F.  The weather is so wonderful here.  Cool!!  Surprised anyone lives anywhere else in the summer.  Relaxed the rest of the day.
Parked the RV and trailer at Devil's Punch Bowl State Park and unloaded the bikes.  Rode south on Hwy 101 the 9 miles back into Newport, OR to the end of the bridge.  Then we rode back to the RV and ate lunch and rested.  Then we rode north to the north end of the Otter Crest Loop, which was 4 miles up hill! But it was 4 miles down coming back!  What a blast it was coming back down! Stopped at Cape Foulweather and picked up some post cards.  The shop and lookout is 500' feet uphill.  This area was named by Captain Cook in 1778.  The views from here of the ocean were breathtaking, abd 100 mph winds are not uncommon.  Hence, the name.  We rode past Yaquina Head Lighthouse today also. The 93-foot tower is Oregon's tallest.  Returned to the RV and loaded the bikes up and headed north to Lincoln City.  We are staying at the KOA for two nights.  Tomorrow we will continue where we left off on our bike route.  Relaxed the rest of the evening.
 Jan went window shopping.  After our ride we took Sammie and hiked the short trail in the park.  Sammie loved it and met new friends that petted her.  Returned to Lincoln City and did our grocery shopping before returning to the KOA.  Laundry was on the agenda this afternoon.  Relaxed the rest of the day.  The weather today was very foggy and cold. F or those of you who don't know, Oregon has very wide shoulders on most of their highways for us to ride on.  In some areas it is even wide enough for us to ride side by side. 

We crossed over "D" River today.  It connects Devils Lake with the Pacific Ocean and appears in the Guinness Book Of Records as the world's shortest river at 440 feet. Was up and out riding by 7 a.m.  Rode from the KOA to Drift Creek and back. Took a different route out than back.  The route back was a nice route around Devil Lake, which is in line with our earned title of the "World's Slowest Bicycle Tourists" bestowed upon us by our friends Brian and Caryl Bergeron - The World Cyclists!  The entire route up the northern Oregon coast is either up or down...no flat!  So, we have the rest of the day to relax.  We did some bicyle maintenance and repair and cleaned them up.  So far no flats or any serious problems.       
Was up at our usual time and found it was really wet outside.  Not actually raining, but close to it because it was so foggy.  Decided to have breakfast at Mel's Kitchen here at the KOA.  It was good.  We ate with Mel himself.  Headed out in the wet by 8 a.m.  Rode 30 miles today.  It was a very nice ride.  We rode what is called the Scenic old Hwy 101 - Slab Creek Road.  The route follows an old highway through some beautiful old-growth forests and farm land.  The total elevation rise is the same as that on U.S. Hwy 101, but over a greater distance, which provided for gentler grades and a more pleasant ride. On the way back we took a little bit of a different turn and went through Otis with a population of 25.  Stopped at the Otis Cafe which is famous for its down-home food.  Met up with a couple of the 4 long distance cyclists that passed us a few minutes before.  Only the guy from Switzerland stopped and actually talked to us for quite some time when he passed going up the hill.  He was very interested in our unusual bikes.  Returned to the KOA by East Devils Lake Road. Loaded up the bikes for travelling tomorrow.  Didn't get back to the park until after 3 p.m. so don't have as much time to relax as usual, but that is OK. Planned our route for tomorrow.  The weather didn't really clear up until we got back to our campsite!  As an interesting side note Jan read that the ascent over Cape Foulweather was 1 mile at 6% grade and the descent was 5% for 2 miles.  We rode it both directions a few days ago!  No wonder it seemed hilly!

After getting the RV set-up we walked across the street to see what was going on.  It was a Dory Days Festival.  We walked around and looked at all the booths and ate at the  "all you can eat" fish fry.  It was pretty good. Returned to the RV and watched TV!  Haven't had TV reception in over a week. Tonight we have total cable.  100s of channels with nothing to watch!  An interesting note about the campground we are staying in is that there are pet bunnies all over the place.  They sell bunny food in the office even. Sammie is smaller than most of the bunnies. T hey pretty much expect you to have food to give them, too.       
This morning we just couldn't get it together. It was cold and foggy as usual here on the Oregon Coast.  We both hurt pretty much all over.  We both got pretty sunburned yesterday, too.  We left the RV Park around 9 a.m. and headed to our latest starting point.  Unloaded the bikes and headed out as we have for several days now.  However, it seems neither of us were really into the ride anymore.  Bill spoke up first and Jan agreed with him totally.  The trip was more fun in 2000 as a self-contained trip - not sagged.  It isn't any fun sagging yourself and riding the route both directions.  We don't meet other cyclists camping in the RV at night either.  So, we loaded up the bikes and went to the Tillamook Cheese Factory to get some free cheese samples and ice cream.  We made our route decision while we ate our ice cream.  We decided to head on home pretty much on the same route we came out on.  We have plenty to do at home.  We don't have to be back to work until August 6th. Drove by the Tillamook Naval Air Station Museum, which is listed in the Guiness Book of World Records as the largest wooden clear-span structure on the planet. The building is 192 feet high, nearly 300 feet wide and 1,072 feet in length. It is more than seven acres in area - big enough inside to play six football games.  Inside the building is a collection of warbirds and vintage aircraft, most of which are fully restored and operational. Today's highway mileage was 295.  Spending the night at the Wild Horse Casino and RV Resort.  Heading over to the casino to find something to eat.  More tomorrow.
Finally got through all the stop and go traffic in Salt Lake City. Stopped for the night at Lake Side RV Resort on Utah Lake in Provo.  We drove 606 miles today!  Wow!  We are both beat.  The plan is to be home in Apache Junction, AZ by tomorrow sometime.
It is a holiday in Utah today we discovered.  It is Pioneer Day.  We ran into several parades.  In all the little towns we went through they had their holiday flags flying.  Many stores and other businesses were closed. Interesting.  The radio stations were all brodcasting from the different festivals.  That is how we discovered what was going on. Ending mileage was 659.  Arrived back in AJ just after 6 p.m.  Darwin and his family invited us over for pizza.  We picked up our mail and house keys from them also.  Passed out souviners. A te and talked some and then went home.  Man the storms sure have made a mess on our patio with leaves and whatnot.  Unloaded only what we needed for the night. End of the Summer 2002 Adventure.
The forecast is for occasional rain and scattered thunder showers. Frankly, this does not trouble me. My bike is a 2001 model Bianchi San Remo with Continental 2000 Touring tires; 700 by 35 as I recall. This set has somewhere between 1500 and 2000 miles on them so far; the back tire shows wear, but not enough to warrant concern for this ride. I fully expect to get the rest of the season out of them. I have Ortlieb rear panniers and bar bag. They have proven their worth in rainy weather.    I look forward to the trip. 
  I was on the road by 6:15 AM. I headed out of Jefferson by way of highway N and the Drumlin trail. I have a lot of pictures to add once I get my camera downloaded.    I traveled the Drumlin Trail east until Mansfield Road. I followed Mansfield east to highway 89. On the bike maps 89 along this stretch is not recommended for biking, but I have found it to be acceptable. The traffic can be busy at times; usually the morning and evening commute periods, but I have never experienced any problems. Most drivers in this area are acclimated toward bicyclists.    I traveled to Waterloo, stopping briefly to review my map and drink water; and then I went on to East Bristol Wisconsin by way of Clarkson Road, taking Deansville Road north to highway V. East Bristol is not much. I did manage to find food and water at a roadside gas station. By this time the heat of the day was picking up and I wanted to make certain carried enough water. I had two of the 750-milliliter water bottles and a 1-liter Nalgene bottle. At the gas station I purchased a gallon bottle of water and refilled all my bottles and drank my fill before moving on down the road. Drinking all that water proved to be a rather poor move; I spend the next hour with a dull ache high on my ride side just below my rib cage. I think my system was struggling with the water, and sandwich I ate when I stopped. It was enough that I slowed my cadence considerably.  Heading on from East Bristol by way of highway V east, I went to Kroncke Road and then north all the way up into Columbia County. Somehow north of Leeds Center I ended up going west and then north. I realized my mistake once I came upon highway 16. I did not want ride highway 16 so I backtracked to Drake Road. The wrong turn added mileage. I am not certain of the amount, but I think perhaps 7 miles. I will say this for the episode, I forgot about my side ache.  Once on Dunning road I was on familiar roads. I used to ride this area years ago on my old Peugeot, which by the way hangs in my garage and is the proud possession of one of my daughters. At this point it was nice to not have to look at maps and simply ride. It was also about here I started seeing wildlife. Got pictures of deer and Sandhill Cranes.  I lunched in the shade of a wood lot along Dunning road at about noon taking my time to cool down and eat slowly. The side ache was a good lesson. Once I headed on to Portage, I did so taking my time the last twelve miles or so; I used the old route I used to ride years earlier when I worked in Portage and lived down off of Dunning Road on highway B.  Most remarkable to me was the damp smell of the swampy land in the Portage area and the seemingly loud sound of frogs, crickets and other swamp creatures. The heat seemed to make the swamp odor more animated and prevalent.  Once in Portage I made a quick stop to visit friends from the past. It was short, too short. I had hoped to hear from them that afternoon once Roger got home, but I never did. My choice of motel for this credit card tour was the Super 8 chain. The one in Portage was not easy to reach by bicycle. It sits on the north end of town near the highway 78 and Interstate 39 junction. Next time I will find something on the south side of town, perhaps along highways 16 and 51. At the end of the ride this first day I was spent, but not so much that I felt I over did the pace. I did carry about 30 extra pounds on the Bianchi including a full load of water. When I do this trip again, I discovered that I will be able to pack lighter and make use of washer and dryer facilities to clean my gear for the next day's ride.       
I found a wonder county park, Muir County Park, that looks to have good fishing and and toilet facilities. No camping is allowed best I can tell. I bet I saw between 20 and 30 sandhill cranes today. I took some pictures of them. I also numerous deer and turkeys as well, but these are harder to get photographs of when biking.  Once out of the swampy lands of the Portage area, the landscape is simply wonderful. And, Marquette county is simply superb. I ate alongside a tank in Dakota Wisconsin and after about a half hours rest continued on to Wautoma, making Wautoma by about 12:20 PM.  This was the most scenic portion of my trip.                     
I started out of Wautoma headed northwest on county highway C. As travel roads go, this one is acceptable, but it had a tad more traffic than suited me. When reached 12th Avenue I turned north. This had the added benefit of putting a county park with facilities; no matter how well one plans, when facilities become important, they are important. And, I was fortunate to find a nice county park just up the road about a half mile. After a few pictures of the lake and park I continued north by way of 12th avenue. I was looking for  a Beaver Drive according to the information on biking map I received from with Wisconsin Biking Federation. I never found Beaver Drive. I was fairly certain of my whereabouts and accordingly I decided that Beechnut Drive, must be the new name. As it turned out, it was the correct road. Scenery continued to be wonderful. I stopped a couple times to photograph the landscape and roadway for this journal. During one of my photographic stops, it seemed as if I could just make out the whine of Interstate 39 in the distance; it was just below the sound of the woodland birds. As it turned out it was an electric motor situated just the other side of the valley that serviced a huge sprinkler system. I saw a number of these pump installations throughout the day. Once I left Beechnut Drive I came out on to flat land that contained huge fields of crops. The wind was more prominent here, but the fact I was headed due west made the impact of the wind more insignificant; I made better time.  Eventually I was able to head due north on 7th and 6th Drive toward Plainfield. Plainfield had a greasy spoon open and I stopped for light breakfast. The food was so-so, and the air inside the cafe was poor; nearly everyone smoked, and I found myself sneezing a good deal. After I left Plainfield I followed my planned route west to the area west of Interstate 39. I had never been in this area before and I wanted to see what there was to see. It proved both interesting and an adventure. I managed to get about 4 miles west of the interstate before I discovered the road I had planned to head north on was a very poorly graveled road. I tried it, and it was too soft for my bicycle and tires... I had to back track. Such are how biking adventures go. Eventually I managed to get as far north as county highway W. I thought things were getting better, but as it turned out, I was still having trouble getting north on paved roadway.  I stopped to read the map, take in some food and water and consider what to do on highway W west of the interstate. While stopped, a pickup truck slowed to a stop. It contained a farmer, his wife and what I think was a grand daughter of about 10 years old. The conversation started with them asking if I was having some trouble, to which I replied that I was hoping to find a paved road north west of the interstate. Grandma and Grandpa began a brief discussion between themselves the eventually supplied me with the information that there was no paved road north unless I went a considerable distance west toward Wisconsin Rapids, or back east of the interstate. They did decide to agree that Taft road, did have some pavement, but as to exactly how far north of highway W it started was anywhere from 1 to 3 miles.  Since the wind was keeping me to a 11.8 mile an hour average, after checking the conditions on Taft, I decided to strike out north on gravel. It was an adventure. I managed to pace along with a group of tractors, baling straw or weed bedding, all the while being down wind of their dust. I simply could not get clear of the dust, and to top it off I actually had more truck traffic on Taft during the gravel portion, that the entire time I was west of the interstate.  Eventually I did get to pavement, and was able to make it to Plover.  In Plover, I managed to have only bad luck, finding only people incapable of giving verbal directions. I ended up putzing around Plover for almost an hour trying to work north to Stevens Point. Eventually I did get there, but it was strictly by luck and instinct. Between instructions and road construction, I seemed doomed an eternity wandering Plover. I made Stevens Point and my motel by 2:30 PM. It was good to be able to clean off the dust and sand.                 
As it happened, I managed to find a bridge out and I had to route around it a bit. But it was not bad riding. This is the area of younger days, and I had rode parts of this area earlier in the summer on the Bike Northwoods Tour. The weather was nearly perfect and the wind light and variable. It was nice. I got to Marshfield by 11:30 AM and ate lunch with family on Walonnie drive.       
The bottom bracket is original, but I changed the gearing to 44-39-24. If I ever do go long distance and end up out on the road more than a weeks time, I will re-think my gearing and perhaps change the bottom bracket to allow for some even smaller middle chainrings and granny gearing. The freewheel cassette is original, it is 9 speed and runs from 11 to 26 I have a Tubus rear rack, a Blackburn front racks, Ortlieb bar bag and Ortlieb rear bags. The Ortlieb rear bags are a recent upgrade. I also own Kirtland bags, both front and rear, but I always seem to catch rain. Of course this time with Ortlieb  bags I did not. My fenders are SKS and my saddle is my trusty Brooks B-17. Best darn saddle I ever owned! This bike is staying in the touring riggings. I got my go-fast bikes to satisfy those Saturday and Sunday treks around Jefferson County. I have no more tours planned this season. But I am already looking at Minot North Dakota to Jefferson Wisconsin next year... ya think?
   Show links to this Hide links to this      Maybe it's this proximity that gives rise to visions of travel. I can never see the Gold Rush, parked and static in my office, but always place it in my daydreams far from home on some scenic winding road. It was during one of these temporary lapses in meaningful work that I hatched my latest plan. We were into April because I had just turned 67 years old and had just had my annual physical. If I have a birthday and a checkup it must be April. Work, weather, visits to my daughter in college and assorted stuff had gotten me out of my riding pattern. It would soon be time to attend Return to Freedom, an event I had missed in prior years but had every intention of participating in this year, riding Amtrak to the Bay Area and then returning by GRR to Bakersfield. Our local recumbent group, probably for the same reasons as mine, had fizzled out. I needed a shakedown cruise before RTF - not too long and not too hard. I retrieved some county maps and spread them out on the plan table (over the plans, naturally - that could wait). Soon, I had mapped out a little three day tour, Bakersfield to Corcoran to Porterville and home, maybe 160 miles or so. Each day culminated in a little town with a cheap motel. Not the most scenic tour but OK for the first one of the year. Lately, the usual prevailing winds from the northwest had been mostly from the southeast, so I would utilize this tailwind to get me off to a good start. 
After a delicious short stack and filling of water bottles, I struck out north again. The wind, if anything, was even stronger - maybe 15 mph. The traffic was light and courteous and the shoulders were adequate if not overly wide. I appreciated the Gold Rush, boring into the wind with low profile and fairing. I was sure that with a diamond frame bike and a higher profile I would not be making as much progress into the wind. When I become tired or uncomfortable on a DF bike, I tend to not use the handlebar drops and just sit upright placing my hands on the tops. This further increases the wind drag. I noticed that with my rear panniers loaded on the rear rack and centered over the rear axle the front end steering seemed a little lighter. It presented no problem, just different. The landmarks along this stretch of Highway 43 were few and far between and I had seen them many times before on other trips. About halfway along was a junkyard complete with a standard issue junkyard dog. In the past this guy had given spirited chase but this time he was a no show. A little further on was Colonel Allensworth State Park, a historical site that I would surely visit if it were located at a destination. Instead, it was just a landmark along the way no matter in which direction it was passed. I was in no mood to stop. I gave myself permission to stop every five miles to rest if needed. Surprisingly, I only stopped twice, once to remove clothing as the day warmed and once to switch water bottles between cage and panniers. Soon, I caught sight of Corcoran Prison and knew my destination was close at hand. Corcoran Prison has a reputation among inmates (I hear) as one of the roughest in the California Correctional System. Seeing its lights and towers and slits for windows, I had no reason to doubt it. I was grateful, even laboring against a headwind, to be free and clear on the outside! That evening I walked around town a little, ate and retired to my motel to watch the Lakers beat Sacramento. 
This proved to be a good decision. The traffic subsided and the road wasn't at all bad, except for that one spot that flatted my front tire. This was to be a short leg today so I was in no hurry. I sat down and changed the tube very methodically. It was still accomplished in under fifteen minutes. Soon, I was pedaling into Porterville with a soft front tire (I never could get a hundred pounds into a tire with a frame pump). I found a bike shop (all BMX, all the time) and the owner helped me get my tire up to pressure. My motel was not ready for my early arrival, so I returned to the bike shop and bought a 20' tube to show my appreciation and kill some time. If I had needed a rear 700c tube I would have been out of luck at this shop. 
Here, there was a wide paved shoulder only marred by heavy traffic, rumble strips and dead truck tire fragments. Each shard of tire casing came with those fine little wires that are capable of giving you not just one flat tire, but multiple flat tires, if you don't discover the embedded wire the first time. This was my preoccupation then, avoiding pieces of exploded tires while making good time towards home. Finally, a nice tailwind had kicked in. Then, something happened - something that would have been avoided had I stayed off Highway 65 until after Ducor. But who can say my fate would not have been worse if I had stayed on that back road? That's the thing about fate - you just never know. I was traversing a bridge midway through a wide, sweeping left turn. The shoulder narrowed slightly and was flanked by steel barrier rails. The only approaching vehicle was a large tank truck pulling a trailer. The truck would be starting his own wide, sweeping right turn to cross the bridge I was on. Only he didn't turn. I watched, in a sort of fascination, as the truck crossed into the opposing traffic lane and continued in a straight line directly toward me! Oddly, there was no fear on my part, just awe. I couldn't believe it. I had several thoughts, all with the speed of light and not expressed in words. I could jump off the bike and climb over the barrier rail. There was no time for that, besides the truck would hit the rail right where I was. I could veer to the left and out of his path, but what if he discovered his error and corrected his course at the last moment? I would then have placed myself in front of him again. I had no options. I stared at the grill fast closing on me. At least it would be quick. The truck now crossed onto the shoulder and over the rumble strips on my side. I gripped the Gold Rush's handlebars and braced for the collision. Then I saw some activity behind the truck's tinted windshield and it made a quick correction to the right accompanied by the screech and protest of tires at the limit of adhesion. Missed me! The truck continued north. The opposing traffic had avoided it. I was heading south in relative quiet with a tailwind and a smoothly functioning bike, in good health and soon to be home. What had just happened? Had it happened? It was unreal. Business as usual.    The rest of the trip home was given over to philosophy. Cycling is healthy. It can make your life better and it can probably extend your life. It can also end it abruptly. Did the truck driver have his head in the cockpit and not see the curve? Did he fall asleep? If so, had the rumble strips awakened him just in time? If so, I will never malign those things again. If I saw a vehicle in my rear view mirror drifting over onto my shoulder would that be any different than this head on encounter? I don't think so. The considerations would be about the same with very little time to react. I do not expect to alter my cycling habits. I love the idea of traveling somewhere by bicycle. As with any endeavor, cycling on the road involves risks and you are at the mercy of the competence, experience and mind set of every driver along your route. Those risks still appear to me to be manageable. Now that I have had my close encounter maybe the statistics will spare me another. Maybe not. Soon I was home, pushing my Gold Rush up the hill to my back yard. Another completed mission with no problems except an errant driver and a flat tire. This was to be a trial run for later and I came up with a few issues. The panniers hanging off the rear rack worked just fine but how much better would the underseat panniers be? My 700c x 28 rear tire also worked well too, but should I go up a size? My sense is that it is not very important compared to being in shape. As usual, fitness wins out over mere style or technology. I'm ready for Return to Freedom! (Note: Return to Freedom is a weekend get-together at the Easy Racers' factory in Freedom, California for all owners of their products.) 











When we arrive at St. Remy, it is in the midst of its weekly market and the whole downtown area is mobbed.  Riding or even pushing the tandem is not easy in this crowd.  We decide to head over to the tourist office, get a list of lodgings and take care of that.  We find a very peasant place on the southern edge of town.  This one has two distinctions.  The B&B rooms are in an annex recently built just for that purpose, behind a modern home - three very pleasant rooms.  Also this is the only B&B we stayed in where the hosts speak only French.  We have enough for basic communication, but miss the chance to chat and learn about the area that we had in Reillanne.  Once we are settled in and walk back to the town center, the market is closing down, so we walk around the town seeing the sights and checking out restaurants. 



We spend a good chunk of time visiting the museum of traditional Provencal culture - Musee Arlatan.  This museum was founded by Frederick Mistral, whom I mentioned a couple of days earlier, and is devoted to preserving the traditional Provencal way of life that was already dying out at the end of the 19th Century when Mistral was at his peak.  A word on Mistral:  He won the noble prize for literature in 1914, the only poet who wrote in a minority language to be so honored, and was passionate about the preservation of traditional culture and language.  He is revered locally as a local boy who made good in a big way. A few more tourist sights and the day is done.  I feel more tired than I would from a day on the bike. 

Though our experience is limited to this one trip (so far), it seem like the prime times for cycling here in the south would be May and the first half of June, September and the first half of October.  Mid summer would be too hot for riding and crowded enough to make the roads busier and lodging harder to find. We were very glad we had put in the effort to learn a little bit of French.  We didn't have much - we certainly could not converse in any general sense, but enough to get basic needs met.  At the very least, learn numbers and polite greetings.  Life in France is more ceremonious than in the US.  One does not just walk into a store and state your business without politely greeting the staff first.  In small towns and country places, everyone you meet will offer "Bon Jour".  If you picnic in the town square as we often did, most of the people who pass will wish you "Bon Apetit" Contrary to what many Americans have heard, people treated us very well.  Most of the hotels we stayed in were very small, with little space to spare, but every one managed to find an indoor place for the tandem, sometimes at some inconvenience to themselves.  French drivers are fast, but mostly pretty skillful and respectful of bicycles  We Look forward to going again, hopefully with a bit more of the language next time. 
   Just before we took off, I noticed that Bruce's helmet said "HEADWINDS" in both sides.  Aaaaugh!  I scribbled over "HEAD" with a Sharpie, and we were off.  I think it worked, since the first five miles of our journey were downhill with a tailwind.    Follow along at home:  We took the ferry from Vashon Island (Washington, that is, the moldy corner of the American linoleum) to Southworth, then rode through Bremerton, Silverdale, Paradise Bay, and Port Ludlow before camping on a beach just outside of Irondale. Bruce and Cindy are good friends that I met when I lived in Portland, Oregon.  They currently live on Vashon Island.
Rear Cassette and Freewheel Chain Cranks (Crankarms and Chainrings) Bottom Bracket Yikes!  Cchh-cchhing!  I won't divulge the final cost, but with a whole new drivetrain, Bruce it basically riding a new bike now.  He's had the bike for 13 years and has never replaced any part of the drivetrain, which is quite impressive considering how much he rides (a lot, through the rain most the time). It's a good thing that we stopped at the bike shop.  I learned that my freewheel wasn't completely tight, which was causing a bit of play in the rear wheel.  Now it's nice and tight, and we're cruising along splendidly. Follow along at home:  After taking the ferry north from Port Townsend, we camped at Deception Pass State Park.  Big thick damp forest, luckily no rain.    Word of the day:  Bleearrgh.   
Follow along at home:  We rode over Deception Pass (blocking traffic the whole way, of course), through Bay View, Sedro Wooley, and Concrete before camping in Rockport.  No rain and a good tailwind until Concrete, where it started to drizzle and our tailwind went away.    Thanks to Mom for the guardian angel, a little coin in a plastic case that looks like it's been run over by a train a few times, and thanks to Rob for sending me an extra pin for The Pig. We hung out in a bar in Rockport for a couple of beers, watching the Mariners lose.  I learned that I'm good at pulltabs, pronounced "PULLTABS!"  Gambling IS fun! The locals in the Rockport bar think that we are crazy for trying to ride across the pass so early.  Crazy guy on a bike?   
We hung out at the North Cascades Visitor Center for a while, then went to camp. Lucky for us (?), route 20, which takes us up and over the Cascades, opened the day before (2002-05-07).   
         Food as fuel: I ate 1,500 calories of peanut butter at 7 am, and was hungry a couple of hours later.  After a day of peanut butter and Snickers (warm, of course), I needed some ruffage. We went to a brewpub in Winthrop to drink beers, eat gobs of food, and watch the Mariners lose.   
It's a beautiful day - 70 degrees and bright sunshine - and there's nowhere I'd rather be.  Winthrop is having its Pioneer Days, or something to that effect, this weekend, so we may walk around and look at things, whatever those things may be. I'm on a self-imposed water fast after yesterday's peanut butter - Snickers episode.  It was great for energy, but ...   
Follow along at home:  I rode from Winthrop to Twisp, up and over Loup Loup Pass, then through Okanogan to Tonasket.      Ate lunch at the Caribou Cafe in Okanogan, the type of place where the waiter comes to your table and asks what type of burger you want. Mom - don't read the next sentence.  Highlight of the day: I reached 44 mph coming down the pass.  The bike felt real stable, especially after truing the rear wheel and replacing the rear tire with the spare in Winthrop. I camped right in Tonasket, at an RV park, and watched the Mariners win. After the high-pitched town alarm went off at around 10 pm (for what, I don't know, but I'm still alive), I learned that there are quite a few dogs in Tonasket.
Follow along at home:  Left Tonasket, rode up and over Wauconda Pass, then down into Republic. Route 20 between Tonasket and Republic is a pretty lonely road.  Beautiful high desert country - there's a definite difference between the forests to the west of the Cascades and the east.    Had a anchovy - feta calzone in Republic before heading to camp.  I noticed that people that I talked to after eating the calzone kept their distance from me.  Mmm ... anchovies.
   Follow along at home:  Rode from Republic up and over Sherman Pass, through Kettle Falls to Colville. Colville is pronounced call-ville, using the lazy vowel Overhomer accent common to those living in Southern Utah.  Just like home! For breakfast, I splurged and bought oatmeal.  It did me right, much better than the peanut butter - Snickers fiasco. Ate lunch in Kettle Falls, a little logging town.  Boise Cascade has a plant there, and more logging trucks passed me during the day than any other type of vehicle.   
Follow along at home (all points in Colville, WA):  rode to Safeway, then to an outdoor store, to the library, back to Safeway, then to camp for lunch, off to the bookstore, back to the library, etc. I read a story in the New Yorker about the Washington State Militia, a group formerly (?) located in Whatcom County, Washington.  It's no wonder I saw a sign that read "GET THE USA OUT OF THE UNITED NATIONS" while riding through that area of Washington. Might check out tonight's Mariners game at a bar called the Logger Tavern.  Hmm.  Logging country.  Maybe I should wear my flannel, and ask for a Spotted Owl Burger.
Follow along at home:  Left Colville, rode along Rt. 20 to Ione, then rode south along the shores of the Pend Oreille River (see the guestbook for Kurt's correct pronunciation of the river).    The campground that I wanted to stay at was closed, as was immediately told to me by the Campground Host (guy that lives in a trailer all summer at the campground - yes, a trailer Down By The River).  He told me about a nice site just down the road that I could poach, and invited me to have a beer with him.  We had a good talk (mostly he talked, I listened).  He told me about his first child that was born in the toilet (he scooped her out and took her to the hospital - she got down to 2 lbs. and is now a firejumper in some mountain state), then how he and a friend of his left college in '58 to hang out in Cuba during the revolution, etc.  Hmm.   
Me, after noticing a huge red chainsaw on display at the back of a counter, we're talking a chain 8 feet long: "WOW!  What's the story with the chainsaw?" Cafe lady: "Oh that old thing?  That's just an old chainsaw." Oh. OK. Follow along at home:  Rode from camp (south of Ione) along the Pend Orielle River, entered Idaho just south of Newport (glad I didn't mention Kurt's name in THAT town), ate lunch in Priest River, then camped just south of Sandpoint. Witnessed a beautiful sunset at camp, across the huge Pend Oreille river (yes, I was camping again in a camp Down By The River).   
Scene:  I'm riding through town, in the rain.  This guy gets out of his pickup (of course), and waves me over: Guy: "Come here." Me: "Hi." Guy: "You might want to stay in town tonight. There's a car show in town!" Me, not interested and wanting to get out of the rain: "Oh. Where's the laundromat?" Guy: "Two blocks down." Guy gets back in pickup.  Hmm. I rode across this bridge this morning, and could not figure out how this guy managed to fall off, what with the guardrail and all. SANDPOINT, Idaho (AP) -- A bicyclist who fell off a pedestrian bridge clung to its girder and yelled for five hours before he was rescued -- ignored by two boys who walked away laughing, police said.  Christopher Blair apparently tipped over a guardrail on an unlit bridge over Lake Pend Oreille at about 9:30 p.m. Saturday.  The cyclist managed to scramble to safety on the bridge's concrete piling, and then climbed onto support beams 12 feet above water, where he began to scream for help.  "He said that he had been yelling for help all night and had even been located by two juvenile boys, but they would not help him," Sheriff's Deputy Ben Sterling said in a report filed Tuesday.  A nearby resident finally heard Blair's screams at 2:20 a.m. Sunday. A search by flashlight found Blair perched on the beams, suffering from early signs of hypothermia.  "I could see that he was trembling, he was wet, and he had a very red nose," Sterling said.  Rescuers lowered Blair by basket into a rescue raft and took him to Bonner General Hospital, where he was treated for minor injuries and released.
After a series of troubling events, I made the executive decision to leave Sandpoint last night at 4 pm.  Rode 15 miles east on Rt 200 from Sandpoint to a primitive campground. The most disturbing thing that happened to me in Sandpoint: someone pulled Queen Lukihulapuli off her mount.  It happened while I was in the the grocery store.  When I came out of the store, she was dangling by the spring, detached from the mount.  Later that night in camp, I reattached her with some duct tape.  I'm thinking of duct taping her dress on, as it's slowly coming off.  Hmm. Follow along at home (Slideshow Rob - please get bent):  Headed east from camp to Clark Fork, where I asked the gas station attendant whether to stay heading east on 200 or head north on 56.  After she became misty-eyed when talking about 56, I took a left and camped at a free (!) National Forest campground 18 miles south of Troy, on route 56.    Montana is wonderful, definitely my favorite state so far.  The people are friendly, the scenery is breathtaking, and the roads are in good condition.  Not as many logging trucks, either.   
Follow along at home: rode north on Rt 56 to Rt 2, headed east on Rt 2 to Libby, turned east then north on Rt 37 to a campsite near McGuire Mountain, along Lake Koocanusa.    My vote for bikepack food of the trip is Velveeta shells and cheese.  1,100 calories, tastes ok with a lot of salt and pepper, and can fit nicely in The Pig.  Today, even after eating the whole thing, I was still looking for more.  I had my eye on the box, but ... Right after setting up camp, a thunderstorm preceded by a windstorm hit.  I sat in the tent as the winds must have reached 40 mph and read.  Thankfully, the tent held, and there was much rejoicing. Lots of bald eagles and osprey in this area.
Follow along at home:  Continued heading north on 37, took a right on Rt 93 into Eureka. Eureka is a cute little town with free camping (before Memorial Day) and free showers right in town, a great natural foods (?) cafe, etc.   
It's raining It's raining I can't tell you when The storm is gonna end So go ahead and cry But that won't make you dry A song that's in my head.  I usually have a song in my head as I'm riding along, and most of the time I have no idea where it came from.  Here's the songs that I had in my head at various times yesterday: Atomic Punk (Van Halen) Wiggum (Bad And Worse) Dune Buggy (The Presidents of the United States of America) Poundcake (Van Halen) Blister In The Sun (Violent Femmes) For other days, it's not the same songs, but it's just as baffling. Tomorrow's forecast: mixed rain and snow, high of 40, low of 30.  I wonder if I'll miss this weather when I'm riding through the heat of the Midwest. A bumper sticker I saw in town: "If you hug a logger, you'll never go back to a tree."   
Woke up this morning at 6:30 am, it was still raining.  OK, I'll wait until it settles down, then I'll ride to Whitefish.  At 8 am, it didn't sound like rain anymore, had a harder sound.  Then, at 8:30, more of a splatter.  So, I flung open the tent's rain fly to see just what the &$@^ was happening, and saw that about 1" of snow had already fallen.  Now it's almost noon, and about 3" of snow has fallen.  It's still snowing.  I don't think I'll ride today.  And, I hope the tent holds.  Tomorrow's forecast?  Snow.  A bit warmer.  Hmm.    For those of you that read this in the Daily Inter Lake police log and thought it might be me, I'm not in Whitefish yet: "An older, apparently intoxicated man was loud and obnoxious as he pushed his bike along Colorado Avenue on Monday night." Had a great conversation last night with an older gentleman that's staying at the same campground as I.  He's living in a van, the campsite is by the river ... you get the idea.  He lives in Alaska and spends his summers in Montana (?).  He used to race sled dogs.  Huskys.  I was amazed to hear that a 30 mile race is considered a sprint, and that the dogs can run 20 mph for 30 miles.  Wow. Better go check on the tent and the bike, make sure that they haven't washed away from an overflowing river.
   A random Labrador showed up at the park last night, so we played fetch for about a half hour.  Dog would not stop, and it loved the water, even with an air temperature of 32F. Follow along at home: Rode from Eureka (a bit teary-eyed) south along Rt 93 to Whitefish. Hoping to stay at a hostel tonight (I won't know 'til 6 if there's a bunk available).  This may be the first night of the trip that I've stayed indoors. I forgot to mention: I started the 10-mile project in Twisp, Washington.  Every 10 miles (whenever the odometer clicks over to xxx0.0), I stop and take a picture of the road and scenery in front of me.  By the time the trip is through, I may have up to 450 pictures.  Hmm. Song-in-my-head of the day:  Information Travels Faster by Death Cab For Cutie.
The ride:  Rode from Whitefish through Columbia Falls and West Glacier to the Apgar Campground in Glacier National Park.  After dropping The Pig off at the campground, I rode up Going-To-The-Sun road as far as they'd let me (no, not the voices in my head, the Park - the road still isn't completely open), and then turned around to head back to camp. Song-in-my-head of the day: Another Lonely Day by Ben Harper. They had the GTTS road closed to motor traffic beyond Avalanche Campground, so it was a nice and quiet ten-mile ride up to the first tunnel, where the signs asked me nicely to turn around, don't go any farther, this means you.    As I was descending on the GTTS road, I saw a grizzly bear standing in the road.  Brakes, brakes!  A guy on a bike was standing about fifty yards from it, looking at it through binoculars.  He's seen a lot of grizzlies, and estimated this one to be 2-3 years old.  It was bigger than a cub, and smaller than an adult. Sooooo, in order to save this guy and two other cyclists coming up the road, I quickly got out my pepper spray, just like I'd been practicing the night before, and discharged the whole can into the bear's undoubtedly evil eyes.  It then stood on its hind legs, started pawing at its eyes, and stumbled off into the woods.  Immediately afterwards, while the onlookers were all cheering me, I blew the steam off the spent pepper spray canister, twirled it around a couple of times, put it back in my pack, and rode off into the sunset.  It kinda reminded me of that scene in A Christmas Story when Ralph defeats Black Bart. Uh, no, sorry, disregard that previous paragraph.  Couldn't help it.  The bear was munching on grass on the side of the road, as peaceful as can be.  After he was a good 15 feet off the road, we decided to ride by him.  I couldn't help but glance at him as I rode by, and he had the cutest eyes.  As Molly would say, Sweeeet Baby!   
The ride: Rode from camp to West Glacier, then east along Rt 2 up to Marias Pass (because it's there, 5,280'), then back to camp.    Song-in-my-head of the day: Fine Day For A Parade by Fountains of Wayne. Saw another grizzly bear this morning, between camp and West Glacier.  He was a cub, so I didn't stay long to wait and see if momma would show up. A long day, but relatvely easy without The Pig dragging me down.  Marias Pass is the lowest road that crosses the Continental Divide in Montana.  The highest?  I dunno, but I'm not looking for it. Saw my first bike tourer today, which is surprising since I've been on the road for almost two weeks.  He was towing a BOB trailer, and was headed up to the top of Marias Pass as I was headed back down.   
Song-in-my-head of the day:  Sleep On The Left Side by Cornershop. Last year there was a big fire on the west side of Glacier NP.  It jumped roads, jumped the river, etc.  The scenery was fascinating as we made our way to Bowman Lake.    We?  I met another cyclist at camp last night, of course he was towing a BOB (those trailers seem to be standard issue).  Floyd is from Whitefish, 50 years old with a Bianchi cyclocross bike, likes his guns (he moved to Montana for the relaxed gun laws), and just came to Glacier for the weekend to ride around a bit. The year after a forest fire, mushrooms grow in abundance.  Two years after the fire - no mushrooms.  I guess the fire sterilizes the ground, and, uh, the mushrooms, uh ...  Along the way we met a guy that filled two five gallon buckets with Morel mushrooms, and he gave us the scoop.  Of course, I've got it all on tape. Scene:  We had just turned off the paved road onto the dirt road heading towards Polebridge.  Floyd, kind of a loose rider, hit an unfortunate series of divots in the road, his front wheel immediately turned 90 degrees, and he went sailing over the bars.  Complete yard sale.  Two older ladies in a sedan with Washington plates were about 50 feet away, driving towards us slowly. Floyd (with bloody forearms) to the ladies, after getting up: "Did you get a picture of that?" Ladies: "Oh, gosh, are you ok?  That looked like it HURT!" Floyd: "Oh me, I'm OK, I like to do that about every five miles." Floyd got hit a couple of years ago and has huge scars on his head from the crash.  He wasn't wearing a helmet.  He still doesn't wear a helmet.  Hmm.   
Song-in-my-head of the day: I've Been Wondering by The Minders. Had a 10-15 mph headwind all along Rt 206, as I was headed south.  Then it started raining.  And the wind didn't let up.  Huh.    My mom's friend's nephew and his wife (got that?) invited me to stay the night at their place Kalispell, and I gladly accepted.  It was great - I took a shower and washed my clothes!  Aah, cheap thrills.  Thanks Scott and Heather!
The Ride:  Rode south from Kalispell to a country blacktop road that connected me to Rt 82, turned east on Rt 82 into Big Fork, then headed east then south on Rt 82 to Swan Lake.    Song-in-my-head of the day:  God Bless America (I heard it in a gas station, then saw it on a bumper sticker, and it stuck) Saw a couple of wild turkeys between Kalispell and Big Fork.  Thought about dinner.  Right before entering Big Fork, it rained hard - big, cold drops - for about five minutes, then stopped.  It was an exercise in clothing layer management. At camp, I met a guy from Germany that's leading a bunch of German teenagers from New Mexico to Vancouver, B.C.  They stopped for candy bars and a 12-pack of Coke, then they were off to Big Fork - 23 miles away, at 8:30 pm.  Hmm.
The ride:  Rode south from Swan Lake on Rt 83 through Condon (Kathy! Jim! Elizabeth!) to Seeley (Slideshow Rob!) Lake.    Song-in-my-head of the day:  Cult of Personality by Living Colour. I thought that today's ride would be easy, but it ended up being all uphill.  In a hailstorm.  With bears chasing me.  And locals shooting at me.  In the dark.  Backwards.  OK, I'll stop. During my lunch stop at Condon, I talked to some bear hunters.  They hadn't seen any bears yet (I pointed them to Glacier), but they were still looking.  It was funny seeing these big hunters decked out in camoflage eating little ice cream cones.   
   Song-in-my-head of the day:  Rain by The Beatles. I realized that it's rained every day since I've been in Montana.  Except for the Eureka rain-to-snow incident, nothing extended, but still rain. Scene:  While riding along the dirt road, I stopped to talk to a couple of guys standing by their pickup, looking through binoculars. Me:  "Whatcha looking for?" Guy:  "Gophers." Me:  "Why?" Guy:  "We're shooting them." Me, kidding:  "To eat?" Guy:  "No, just for fun." There's gophers, or prairie dogs, whatever you want to call them (targets?) all over Montana.     
Missoula's a great town.  I'm glad I rode out of my way to hang out here for a day.  Nice downtown area, and the weather is great!  (80 degrees, bright sunshine). I spent the morning riding from my campsite to the KOA ($8, not bad), cleaning the bike, drying out the gear.  Bruce and Cindy - thanks for the books. Hung out for a couple of hours in the Adventure Cycling main office.  The maps that I used from Anacortes, WA to Sandpoint, IA, and the maps that I'll use from ?, Illinois to Bar Harbor, Maine were created by Adventure Cycling.
For lunch, I had a huge plate of some of the best jambalaya I've ever had, in this dingy bar in town.  The type of place with tinted windows and no name on the front.  I was eating at the bar with a few guys drinking PBRs (it is Saturday afternoon and all), watching a Discovery channel program about penguins.  It was funny - we were totally captivated by the show, me eating my jambalaya and them drinking their many beers. Tonight I'm going to see Reverend Glasseye and his Wooden Legs, a band that, I'm told, sounds like Tom Waits.  Hmm.
The ride: rode east from Missoula  on Rt 200 to Ovando, where I turned south on a nice dirt road that wound its way between farms, to Rt 141 where I turned north to hook up with Rt 200 heading east again.    A big badger crossed right in front of me while I was on the dirt road.  It ran to the other side, sat down, and stared at me, like it didn't know what to do.  As it was a badger, I didn't hang around long to watch it. Song-in-my-head of the day: Jerry Was A Race Car Driver by Primus. Camped just to the east of Lincoln, just off the road.  I haven't been too crazy about paying for campsites lately.  Montana's big, plenty of space, and I don't leave a trace, so why should I pay $10 to be able to use a picnic table?  Hmm. Caught up with another bike tourer today on Rt 200.  She just graduated from the U of M, and is riding back home to Seattle.  She's basically taking the same route that I did, only in reverse.  She's riding a Bianchi mountain bike that she found in the trash - it was clean, and looked to be in pretty good condition.  I'm riding a Bianchi mountain bike as well, bought it new in '94 and have been riding it ever since, but mine looks like it was just pulled from the trash.
Song-in-my-head of the day:  Strange As They Say by Blinker The Star. An interesting weather day.  About a mile from the top of the pass, I felt the temperature suddendly drop about five or ten degrees, and then it started to hail / sleet on me.  OK, so I sped up, made it to the pass, donned the Gore Tex, and waited for the storm to pass (30 minutes).  A couple hours later, as I crossed I-15 on my way to Hauser Lake, I looked in my mirror and saw clouds, lots of them.  I turned around and could see the sheets of rain heading across the valley.  Aaaaugh!  The approaching storm turned the headwind that I had been riding into for quite a while into a 20 mph tailwind, so I sped up, ducked into a barn, donned the Gore Tex (again), and waited for the storm to pass (30 minutes).    Found a great campsite.  Lots of wildlife.  A deer came and stood about 30 feet away from me for a couple of minutes, not knowing what to make of me.  Of course, he was upwind - otherwise, his eyes would've started to water and he would've run off, trying not to gag. Added some more duct tape to Queen Lukihulapuli.  Her dress keeps wanting to come off.  Hmm.
The ride: Rode south from Hauser Lake to Helena. Song-in-my-head of the day: Summer of '69 by Brian Adams.  Yep, heard it from a passing pick-up, and it stuck. Helena is great.  It's a cute town of about 35,000, nestled in the foothills to the south with the big flat valley to the north and east.  I'm camped at Mt. Helena City Park.  It's a nice site, I've got a great view of the city, but camping in the foothills didn't give me any flat ground, so I'm on a bit of a tilt.  The nice lady at the visitor's center said, "Sure, you can camp in the park, why not?"  I like that reasoning.  The sign at the park said "No Camping", but it didn't say "This Means YOU!", so, remembering the visitor's center lady's advice, I camped.  Why not? Wednesday, 6/5/02: Song-in-my-head of the day: Moby Octopad by Yo La Tengo. I rented a mountain bike (a Schwinn Mesa aluminum hardtail) and rode some of the trails around town.  I'd heard that there's good singletrack right outside of Helena - today proved it.  I rode south from town up Grizzly Gulch road, then caught the Mt. Helena Ridge Trail back into town, a 13-mile loop.  It was great.  Sometimes the trail reminded me of riding in the Northwest, all pine covered, and other times it reminded me of riding in Crested Butte, Colorado, across bare slopes with lots of wildflowers. According to the bike shop owner, there's 95 miles of singletrack accessible right from Helena.  I'll have to come back another day to check out the other 82 miles.    Thursday, 6/6/02: Spent the day in the Library, reading, checking stuff out on the Internet (it's on computers now!), etc.  Pretty uneventful - a wonderful day. Last night I saw a band called RoxSlyde played at Helena's weekly Alive at Five thing downtown.  Yikes.  They did mostly cover songs, and they were quite loud for a lazy evening in little Helena.  Kids these days ...
The ride:  rode east out of Helena on Rt 284 (generally, the higher the number, the quieter the road) to Rt 12, headed west into Townsend for lunch, then headed east on Rt 12 to Deep Creek campground.    Song-in-my-head of the day:  Best Friend's Girlfriend by The Cars.  Don't know how that got there. Had breakfast at an organic market.  The usual stuff - bagel, apple, raspberry-pastry thing, but it tasted way better than the usual Safeway swill.  It seemed to last me longer, like my body was able to process it easier than the typical over-processed-partially-hydrogenated crap. Passed a house with a couple of dogs hanging out.  They saw me, and started charging.  I thought, there's two fences, they can't reach me.  Well, the yellow lab reached me, and I was surprised that it could run 17 mph.  After a few seconds of that nonsense, I yelled, "BACK OFF!!" at the dog.  It immediately slowed down, and had this Holy-$#!+-it-can-talk look on its face.
It started raining at 5:30 am, and didn't stop until 9 am.  Finally started riding at 11 am.  It was a damp misty morning, all the way to the top of the pass.  At the top of the pass, it was 38 deg. F, and a 25 mph wind was slapping me in the back, yelling, "giddyup!"  OK. I zipped up, then headed down.  Fast.  With the tailwind and the steep road, the bicycle computer says I got the rig up to 51.2 mph (how 'bout that, ma ?!?).  Could've gone faster, but - damn, that's fast enough.  Where's the fire?  James Brown may be a sex machine, but at the bottom of that cold descent I was a snot machine.  Hey!  Good God!    Saw a huge hawk sitting on a fencepost along Rt 89.  I yelled at it to see it fly, and it must've had a 8' wingspan. Song-in-my-head of the day:  Hash Pipe by Weezer. Found a beautiful place to camp on the side of a dirt road.  I'm reading Big Rock Candy Mountain by Wallace Stegner, that has the following line: "The next night ... they camped in the clear evening with the sun pink on the Crazy Mountains east of them ..."  Funny, when I was reading that, it was a clear evening with the Crazy Mountains just to the east of me - I could see them from my campsite.
The ride: rode west then south from camp on Rt 86 over Battle Ridge Pass into Bozeman.    It rained the whole ride, but the Gore Tex did me well.  The Gore Tex jacket's hood fits nicely over the helmet, the Gore Tex gloves fit well over the bike gloves, and I was all flashed and counterflashed with the Gore Tex pants and socks.  Pit zip management. Song-in-my-head of the day: Life of the Party by Beulah. I was planning on camping once in Bozeman, but with the rains, I made a beeline to the hostel.  $14, and the roof doesn't leak - ok!  Actually, it's a great place.  Met a guy from Poland that's working at Yellowstone for the summer - he talked about his summer job and Poland post-communism, I talked about my bike trip and life in the US. On a D'oh! note, I accidentally dropped my toothbrush in a pile of cow manure. On the way into Bozeman I rode by a mountain called Gobblers Knob.  Hmm, where have I heard that name before?  Wasatch?  Joni, isn't that your secret backcountry skiing spot?  Oops, sorry.
Today I'm hanging out at the library and the hostel, reading.  The hostel has a good stack of Ad Busters magazines that I hope to plow through tonight. Tomorrow I head to Chico Hot Springs, near Emigrant, to meet my brother and dad for some fly fishing in/near Yellowstone.  Should be fun.
     In Emigrant I picked up a couple of things at the Post Office from Kurt and Mel.  Kurt - thanks for the cans of Whoop Ass (an energy drink with lots of riboflavin and stuff).  Mel - thanks for the Chili.  We'll cook it up when I get to Chicago (it takes an hour and a half to cook, and I don't think my stove would last that long or do it justice). On the dirt road I passed a family riding from Bozeman to Yellowstone, for a few days of dodging RVs in the park.  The dad/husband once rode from the east coast to California, so ... First song-of-the-day in my head: Going to California by Led Zeppelin. Then I got to thinking about the dropped-D tuning in that song, so ... Second song-of-the-day in my head: Fat Bottomed Girls by Queen ("Get on your bikes and ride ...") Had a dream last night that I was laying in my tent, and a guy with a little tape recorder playing an Elvis Costello tune I couldn't recognize kept jumping back and forth over my tent.  Hmm.
6/12 Wednesday We went into Yellowstone, went to the Fountain Paint Pots and Old Faithful, saw a lot of bison and elk.  Yellowstone is an amazing place - everyone should visit.  Don't worry about the crowds - yes, there's lots of people, but, damn, the geysers, wildlife, scenery ...   Just go. After seeing the sights, we fished the Firehole river.    6/13 Thursday We fished a spring creek with the help of a guide - Jake from Big Sky Guides.  It was a great day.  The creek was very clear, with lots of cutthroat and rainbot trout.  Dan caught a couple of rainbow - one was an absolute pig - and a cutbo, Dad caught a rainbow, and I caught a brown trout (everybody out). Later we ate dinner at the bar in Chico, played cutthroat (a billiards game), and listened to the bartender tell ghost stories (Chico Hot Springs is haunted).      6/14 Friday We drove up Mill Creek Canyon looking for a place to fish.  The water was quite high, so we decided to go back to the Firehole and stay in West Yellowstone.  After fishing we made burritos for dinner by the side of the river.  We shuttled my bike and gear from Chico to West Yellowstone.   
The ride: Rode east from West Yellowstone to Madison Jct, then north to Norris Jct, east to Canyon Village, south to the Mud Volcano area, then north back to Canyon Village to camp. Songs-in-my-head of the day: Perhaps, Perhaps, Perhaps by Cake (originally done by ?), and Pictures of Me by Elliott Smith. South of Canyon Village I saw a herd of bison crossing the Yellowstone River.  When they reached the other side, most of them started tearing around aimlessly.  Maybe the water rejuvenated them.    The Mud Volcano area is great - lots of pools of mud with sulfur dioxide bubbling up.  What a mess.  My favorite sign read "Danger: Hot Spattering Mud.  Keep a safe distance."
   Song-in-my-head of the day: Bad Moon Rising by Reeves Gabrels (originally by CCR) At the bottom of the 1,000' climb to the pass, I opened up a fresh can of Whoop Ass and drank it slow (that's the key).  I think it helped - the pass was pretty easy. Later at camp I had a headache, I think caused by the elevation coupled with NOT DRINKING ENOUGH WATER (D'oh!).  Today was a hot, long day with lots of climbing (~3,500' total).
Some Elevations: Salt Lake City: 4,200' Base of Alta ski area: 8,530' Top of Mt. Hood, the highest point in Oregon: 11,240' Camp last night: 6,841' The pass that I dragged The Pig and Queen Lukihulapuli over today: 10,947', over two miles high Camp tonight: 4,500' Some Stats: Bottom to top: 7.2 mph avg, 22.7 miles Top to bottom: 18.4 mph avg, 49.1 mph max, 41.2 miles The Ride: Rode east from Cooke City on Rt 212 to the junction of Rts 212 and 296 (the base of the climb), opened up and drank a fresh can of Whoop Ass (thanks again, Kurt), rode over a windy Beartooth Pass to Red Lodge, then turned east on Rt 308 to Bearcreek.    Song-in-my-head of the day: Col. Bruce Hampton and the Aquarium Rescue Unit's version of Working on a Building, a traditional song For camp I treated myself to a lovely cow pasture just east of Bearcreek. Saw a few chubby yellow-bellied marmots during the climb.       
Song-in-my-head of the day: One Man's Dream by Greazy Meal. Murphy is definitely with me on the ride.  In the middle of nowhere, just me and the sagebrush, on the deserted dirt road west of Rt 310, my rear deraileur cable broke.  Fortunately, I had a spare.  If I didn't, I would've been in the highest gear from then until the next bike shop (?!?).    This morning at 5:30 a huge herd of cows about 200 yards from me started mooing at - what?  The sun?  So, sleep was a bit fitful after that. Lovell is a great town, mostly because they have free camping and free showers right in town!  That's my criteria anymore. Watched a little league baseball game tonight right near camp.  The wind was gusting at around 30 mph, no lie, which made for some interesting baseball.  The outfield was located downwind, so as long as they hit it in the air, they were pretty much guaranteed a home run.
1. Eat a whole 12" pizza the night before the ride.  All of it.  Crusts and all.  Think about eating the box. 2. Go to bed early the night before, get up late the day of the ride. 3. Open up and drink a fresh can of Whoop Ass at the base of the climb.  http://www.jonessoda.com/files/whoopass.html 4. Don't look at your odometer during the ascent.  At 4 mph, you won't be getting very far very fast, and you don't need a computer to tell you that. 5. Eat before you're hungry, drink before you're thirsty, shift before the hill. 6. Don't be mashing the pedals less than 60 rpm.  Do whatever you need to do to keep your cadence around 80 rpm - granny (lowest) gear, make-your-own switchbacks, whatever. 7. Enjoy the looks of astonishment from passing motorists. 8. Above all, pay attention to your breath.    The ride: rode east from Lovell on Rt 14A to Burgess Jct. Song-in-my-head of the day: Freedom of '76 by Ween. When I reached the top, I saw a couple of moose hanging out by the side of the road. At the end of the ride, I was completely wiped.  I camped on top of the "pass" (more of a plateau), where the overnight temperature dropped below freezing.   
The ride: rode east from Burgess Jct on Rt 14 to I-90's Exit 14, rode I-90 for two thoroughly awful miles to Exit 16 (I had no choice!), where I was more than happy to exit and make my way on a couple nice backroads to Sheridan.    Song-in-my-head of the day: Belong by R.E.M. I didn't start riding until 10 am.  Yesterday's ride whipped me.  I sat and stared at the babbling brook that I was camped next to for a good hour - not eating, not reading, just staring.  If I made any sound, it was probably "uuuuuuuuuuuuuuhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh." Today's descent was probably my favorite of the trip.  The grade was perfect - I was able to cruise between 35-40 mph without using the brakes, ooh yeah.  I passed an RV. In Sheridan, I showered at the YMCA (I don't shower much), and was surprised to find out that I've lost 15 lbs since starting the trip.  I'm down to 159 lbs.  Yikes. In celebration of the last pass, I drank 25 oz of Sierra Nevada Pale Ale at a local Grub & Pub. Interesting:  If I took the most direct route from Seattle to St. Charles, Illinois (where my parents live), I'd be in St. Charles by now.  Hmm.
The ride:  Rode east out of Sheridan on Rt 336 for 15 miles of paved then 25 miles of dirt / gravel road to Clearmont, took a left on Rt 14 16 (east) thru the bustling metropolis of Spotted Horse (one bar, it was closed) to camp, ten miles east of Spotted Horse. I was relying on the bar in Spotted Horse to be open, so I could get some water for dinner and the ride the next day.  D'oh!  Luckily (?), there was a hose on the side of the building.  I filled all my water containers (two 32-oz Nalgene bottles and my 100-oz CamelBak) to the brim with water that tasted like rubber hose.  Ick.    I saw lots of trains along the dirt road, mostly transporting coal.  This is coal country, big time. Song-in-my-head of the day:  When The Levee Breaks by Led Zeppelin.
The Ride:  Rode east from Spotted Horse on Rt 14 16 to Gillette, rode east from Gillette to Moorcroft on Rt 51 (parallels I-90), took a left in Moorcroft on Rt 24 (north) to Devil's Tower.      A long day, but the tailwind from Gillette to Moorcroft definitely helped. I didn't have to pay the $5 entrance fee to the Monument.  In an effort to get us obese Amercins off our duffs and to the Great Outdoors for some exercise, Dubya waived the entrance fees to all National Parks and Monuments for the weekend.  Woo-hoo! Song-in-my-head of the day:  Airbag by Radiohead. I can see wild turkeys from camp.   
Hung out at Devil's Tower for the morning.  Saw license plates on RVs from all across the U.S.  Lots of prairie dogs in the Devil's Tower area - I could've sat and watched them all day. The Ride:  Rode north on Rt 24 from Devil's Tower across the Bear Lodge Mountains (8% grade uphill, 7% grade downhill) to the WY-SD state line, where Rt 24 turned into Rt 34, continuing east to Belle Fourche.    Belle Fourche (pron. bell foosh) is the geographical center of the U.S., so I had that going for me. Song-in-my-head of the day:  Money For Nothing by Dire Straits. A thermometer in Belle Fourche read 92 deg. F.  It was hot.  I need to shift gears and start riding earlier in the day.  For the last two days, at 4 pm, I've been sapped, can't go any farther, must stop, ugh.
The Ride:  Rode east from Belle Fourche on Rt 34, turned south at St. Onge onto a deserted, paved farm road (ooh yeah), rode under I-90 and picked up Rt 85, which I took south into Deadwood. Somg-in-my-head of the day:  Strawberry Fields by The Beatles. If you're ever thinking about biking Rt 85 from I-90 to Deadwood, think again.  It's a four-lane road with a three foot shoulder, no big deal except that the shoulder is taken up by a rumble strip every twenty feet or so.  So much for riding in the shoulder.  I had to ride on the far right side of the right lane, hoping that anyone coming up from behind would get into the left lane.  Most did, a couple didn't, and that didn't make the climb into Deadwood any easier.    I'm treating myself to a hostel tonight.  Shower, laundry, roof over my head - luxury!
I've seen lots of cars from Minnesota here in the Black Hills.  What gives?  Wait, I should know ... The Ride:  Rode south from Deadwood on the Mickelson Trail, a beautiful rail trail that runs north-south from Deadwood to Edgemont through the deep woods (read: cool shade) of the Black Hills, through Rochford, Mystic, and Hill City to Crazy Horse.    Lots of elevation gain today (3,500'), but it was all pretty easy with the gradual grades of the rail trail. Just before Crazy Horse, along a particularly deserted stretch of trail, I came across a herd of cows standing in the trail, probably 30-40 of them, all sizes, pooping and peeing all over the trail.  When they saw me, they turned around and started walking down the trail, and wouldn't get off.  I followed them for probably ten minutes before coming to a spot with a meadow on one side of the trail, where I ran through the meadow, around the cows.  Poor things - they looked really scared.    The Crazy Horse Memorial is incredible - it's a huge mountain carving (in progress) of Crazy Horse and his, well, horse.  It's a non-profit project, built by the "interested public and not the taxpayer."  http://www.crazyhorse.org Song-in-my-head of the Day:  Black Flag by King's X.
The Ride:  Rode south on the Mickelson Trail to Pringle, took Rt 385 east to the Wind Cave National Park, then after touring the cave I went south on Rt 385 through Hot Springs and north on Rt 79 for a bit to camp (cow pasture again - why not?).    Song-in-my-head of the Day:  Against All Odds by Phil Collins (not by choice, it wouldn't leave!) - you know, "take a look at me now ..." With this heat, I find I'm drinking more and more water.  Today I drank almost all 100 oz. (close to a gallon) of water out of my CamelBak from Crazy Horse to Wind Cave, and that was only the first 26 miles of the trip.
The Ride:  Continued north on Rt 79, turned east through Buffalo Gap and into the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation onto a gravel road that paralleled the southern boundary of Badlands National Park, turned south on paved Rt 27 to Sharps Corner, camped off a farm road just outside of town. I hung out in the Badlands Visitor's Center from 1 pm to 3:30 pm, the hottest part of the day (about 102 deg. F outside), watching some films about Badlands, Indian Traditions (filmed in '73), and Bison (filmed in '67).  The Bison film was great - the ranger and I were the only ones in the visitor's center, and we were admiring the psychedelic effects used in the film.    Song-in-my-head of the Day:  Funky Monks by the Red Hot Chili Peppers. The southern half of Badlands NP is inside the Indian Reservation, and there's a fair amount of controversy related to some fossils that were discovered in the area.  The Indians claim them, the Nat'l Park claims them, you get the picture.
Well, at the General Store in Batesland (pop. 88, B.F.E.), the owner gave me the guest book to sign.  I opened it up, and there it was, staring at me, mocking me: "Lars Clausen www.onewheel.org."  Dude is flying - he started in Oregon on April 29 (about a week before I started), and now is in Wisconsin. The owner of the General Store has a cute 7-year old dachsund named Leo that's just as calm as can be, which is the opposite temperament of Mouse Dog (the old, vicious, yappy shop dachsund that Bruce and I encountered at Port Townsend Cyclery). Leo's owner: "Ooh, Leo, is it too hot out there for you?  Come let momma hold you and give momma a big kiss, yes, yes, it's ok ..." Mouse Dog's owner: "Mouse Dog, be quiet!" The Ride:  Rode south from Sharps Corner to Porcupine (near the Wounded Knee Massacre Site), where I turned east on a gravel road to Batesland, then headed east on paved Rt 18 to Martin (Suzi! Don! Don! Don! Don! Pat! Katie! Jeff!), home of the trumpeter swan (!). When I got to Martin it was 106 deg. F (101 deg. F windchill). In Porcupine I pulled up to a house with a guy sitting outside to ask where I could find a grocery store and some water.  He pointed me in the direction of the grocery store, and said I could fill up my water bottles at his place.  Sure, why not?  He offered me a cup of coffee, but since I don't drink coffee, and it was 96 deg. F at 11 am, I declined.  While I was filling up, he showed me the marijuana plant he's growing.  OK.  Then his cousin came by and asked me if I wanted to smoke some pot before the ride.  Uh, no thanks.  That would probably kill me. The ride from Porcupine to Batesland was not pretty.  102 deg. F, 20 mph headwind, on a dusty road.  I was absolutely caked with dirt by the time I reached the pavement.  I looked like a raccoon.    While I was eating a calzone at the bowling alley in Martin, I had a great conversation with a guy named Les Bearnose that used to be one of four investigators on the reservation. Song-in-my-head of the Day:  Hail Hail by Pearl Jam.
The Ride: Rode east from Martin on Rt 18 into the Rosebud Indian Reservation to a road that branched off south just after Rt 63 branched off north, which I took to Rosebud and then St. Francis.    Three miles away from Rosebud, with a climb ahead of me, I ran out of water.  Not good (it was over 100 deg. F). Me, after filling up my water bottles out of a spigot on the side of a lady's house in Rosebud:  "Is there a grocery store in town?" Lady:  "Up on top of the hill." Me, not remembering a grocery store on top of the hill that I just descended into town:  "That hill?" Lady, pointing to a different hill:  "No, that hill." Me, realizing that I had another huge climb to get to the grocery store, which was not on my way to St. Francis:  "D'oh!" Song-in-my-head of the Day:  Suddenly Everything Has Changed by The Flaming Lips   
First 16 miles:  7.2 mph avg. (ugh) Last 24 miles: 18.2 mph avg. (woo-hoo!) An odd morning.  Here's a sequence of events: 2 am:  The wind changed from a nice, cool breeze from the north to a hot, humid, strong wind from the south.  Uncomfortable sleeping. 4:45 am:  I heard some commotion outside my tent (I was camped about a mile outside of town, just off a dirt road).  I looked out, and saw four kids (punks!) coming right towards me (it was already light, since St. Francis is at the far eastern edge of the time zone).  They saw me, backed off about 40 feet, and one of them (punk!) lit a bottle rocket and launched it at me.  I'm thinking, this is odd.  Luckily he missed, probably because of the strong wind in his face.  Then they ran off.  They were probably up all night, since I could hear people shooting off fireworks all through the night. 5:30 am:  A stray dog came by and was so excited to see me, he almost damaged the tent trying to get to me.  Just a minute, just a minute! The Ride: Rode south from St. Francis off the Rosebud Indian Reservation and across the state line to Kilgore, Nebraska (headwind), where I turned east on Rt 20 into Valentine (tailwind). Song-in-my-head of the Day: (song #7 on Aenima) by Tool. Valentine has free camping and showers.  I think I'll stay an extra day. Met a fellow bike tourer at camp.  John, a member of the LAPD, is riding from LA to Boston.  He hopes to be in Boston in 2-1/2 weeks.  Yikes!  In 2-1/2 weeks I'll still be in Nebraska, waiting for RAGBRAI to start.  I like my pace better.
This morning at 7:30 am in Valentine it was 66 deg. F and 97% humidity.  Kinda foggy cloudy eerie.  But then at 10:30 am, halfway through the ride, the sun came out, the wind started up, and, of course, the wind was smack 15 mph in my face.  So, instead of pressing on to Bassett, I shook my fist at the wind and stopped in Ainsworth. The Ride:  Rode east from Valentine on the Cowboy Trail for a few miles, then continued east on Rt 20 to Ainsworth.    The Cowboy Trail is a rail trail that parallells Rt 20 that I was hoping to ride for 150 miles east from Valentine.  However, the surface is soft, and for the few miles I was on the trail I was plodding through two inches of gravel.  Ah, yeah, I think I'll stick to the road. Song-in-my-head of the Day:  Summertime Rolls by Jane's Addiction
   I kinda lucked out on finding the Golden Hotel.  $29/night, A/C, TV - OK!  The nice lady at the front desk rang my room at 10 pm on 7/4 to tell me that there's fireworks happening at the O'Neill Country Club and that I could probably see them out my window.  In your face, Holiday Inn Express! Sat around and watched a lot of baseball while waiting for the storm to blow over.  Read a book for a while at the library on 7/5, but that was a challenge as I was a bit dizzy and kept falling asleep. The Ride:  Rode east from Ainsworth on Rt 20 through Bassett, Newport, Stuart, Atkinson, and Emmet to O'Neill. Song-in-my-head of the Day:  Fourth of July by Soundgarden (Kate - thought of you and your friend at the People's birthday bash (?) with the line, "light a roman candle and hold it in your hand").
The Ride:  Rode southeast from O'Neill on Rt 20 275 through Inman and then southeast on Rt 275 through Ewing and Clearwater to Neligh. Song-in-my-head of the Day:  California Girls by The Beach Boys (saw 'em performing it on TV - catchy tune!). The corn is definitely "knee high by the 4th of July", thanks to heavy irrigation.
The Ride:  Rode south from Neligh on Rt 14 through Elgin, Petersburg, and Loretto to Albion, where I continued southeast on Rt 39 to St. Edward.    Song-in-my-head of the Day:  Headache by Liz Phair. Ate lunch at the Pizza Hut buffet in Albion.  Since I was feeling much better and had rode 32 miles by that point, I bellied up to the boo-fay and came close to putting them out of business.
The Ride:  Rode southeast from St. Edward on Rt 39 to Genoa and Silver Creek to Rt 92, where I turned east and then south on Rt 81 to Stromsburg. Song-in-my-Head of the Day:  Positive Bleeding by Urge Overkill (Paul Shafer and the CBS Orchestra played it during a commercial break the other night, and it stuck) I arrived at Stromsburg (the Swede Capital of Nebraska!) by noon, which is good since at that time it was already 93 deg. F and rising.  The humidity is almost deafening.
- lots of fireflies (none were flying more than two feet off the ground) - a squirrel and a bunny rabbit playing - the squirrel would lunge after the rabbit, and the rabbit would jump out of the way, sooo cute - lots of little owls divebombing me (none made contact, but I ducked more than once) Today's ride was simply lovely.  For the 40 miles between routes 81 and 79, I rode on a two-lane blacktop road between cornfields, with hardly any traffic.  One of those thin grey lines on the map.  Ooh yeah.    The Ride:  Rode south from Stromsburg on Rt 81, turned east on Rt S12C which turned into Rt 66 to Valparaiso, where I turned south on Rt 79 to Raymond. Song-in-my-head of the Day: Wilma's Rainbow by Helmet.
As I was trying in vain to find the All-Star baseball game last night on the radio, I found that AM radio now consists of the following: 75% sports talk radio, 15% news, and 10% more sports talk radio.  Out of curiosity I listened to a sports talk radio show for a while, and was amazed that so many people can recite so many stats with so much passion about sports. The Ride:  rode east from Raymond then turned south into Lincoln on quiet, unmarked two-lane blacktop roads.    Song-im-my-Head of the Day:  Poundcake by Van Halen. OK, today I figured out how Poundcake keeps getting into my head.  As I was riding east from Raymond, I had a strong crosswind from the north.  When I was getting close to the intersection where I was going to turn south, I realized that the wind would be behind me after making the turn, and I thought, "lemme get on some of that" about the wind, which is precisely what wordsmith Sammy Hagar says in Poundcake about his baby's, well, Poundcake. I'll be hanging out in Lincoln for the next week, visiting a good friend and waiting for RAGBRAI to start.
The Good News:  A couple of hours after it was stolen I found it a few miles away and stole it back. The Bad News:  Not everything was on the bike when I stole it back. 4 pm:  After a tour of Lincoln's huge, beautiful Capital, I went to the downtown library to read for a bit and beat Suzi at online chess. 5:50 pm:  I left the library to head to my friend Matt's place, where I've been staying for the past week beating him at foosball, watching bad (good) kung fu movies, and waiting for RAGBRAI to start.  When I got to the bike rack, I noticed my bike wasn't there, and I had one of those surreal experiences where I doubted everything - did I lock it somewhere else?  Is this a dream?  Am I on Candid Camera?  Is the Tour de Moser over? 6:05 pm:  After a panicked call to Matt, he picked me up and we went to the police station.  An officer took my information, and told us about a few hot spots where my bike may be, for us to check out.  He didn't sound too hopeful, but said if we've got nothing better to do, it's worth checking out. 7 pm:  At the last hot spot to check (People's City Mission, a 24-hour shelter located a few miles from the library), I didn't see the bike, but asked Matt to circle around the building.  I had a hunch, and I was right.  The bike was laying on the lawn, with a couple of guys standing around it.  I said "There it is!", and hopped out of the car, I think before it stopped moving.  My adrenaline was surging, and I ran up to the bike as fast as one can run in flip flops, grabbed it, shouted a few profanities at the guys standing near the bike for good measure (I saw one of them near the library eariler), and rode away.  Those guys could've been armed to the teeth and I wouldn't have noticed.  I was a man on a mission (pun intended).    The handlebar mirror, rear rack bag, helmet, rear light, cable and lock, and my favorite baseball cap are gone, ripped off the bike, as well as the three bike tubes and two books (sorry Dan, the books are officially gone, but the Snickers were saved!) that I just picked up General Delivery from the Post Office.  Today was spent replacing those items, at considerable expense.  Could've been worse - I may have had to buy a new bike. The weird thing?  The bike was stolen in broad daylight, right near the main entrance to the library, and it was locked to the bike rack.  They didn't take the bike right next to mine that wasn't locked up.  And for those of you that have seen my bike, you know it's not the most appealing bike, with rust, duct tape, stickers, etc. So, I'm set to shove off tomorrow for Sioux Center, Iowa, where RAGBRAI starts Sunday.  I was going to leave today, but no big deal.  I'll have to ride three 65-mile days instead of four 50-mile days.  Should be ok. It's still tough to believe that I actually found the bike.  Lincoln is not a small city (225,000 people, home of the University of Nebraska), and I found the bike at least a couple of miles away from where it was stolen.   
The Ride:  Rode north out of Lincoln on 14th St, which turned into lovely 2-lane blacktop.  I rode that north then east into Ceresco, where I turned north onto Rt 77 into Wahoo.  I continued north on Rt 109 to Cedar Bluffs, turned left (west) on an unmarked road to Rt 79, where I turned right (north) to North Bend.    Before leaving Lincoln, I stopped one last time at my favorite bagel place and bulked up for the morning (one everthing bagel with egg and cheese, one everything bagel with chive cream cheese, ooh yeah). The Welcome to Wahoo sign proudly proclaims that Wahoo is the home office of the Late Show with David Letterman. Today was a relatively easy ride since I was fresh out of the gate, and I had a tailwind. Talk about the weather:  When I pulled in to North Bend at 1 pm, the bank thermometer read 97 deg.  At 4 pm, weather.com told me that it was 99 deg. and 35% relative humidity.  I don't need a psych chart to tell me that's icky.  When I left the cafe (I ate a pork chop in order to prime myself for Iowa) at 6:30 pm, the bank thermometer read 96 deg.  That's when I got on the bike to ride nine miles north of town to camp (right next to a cornfield, lots of mosquitoes and daddy longleg spiders).  It got down to 75 deg. overnight, but the humidity, oh the humidity ...
Highlight of the day:  I was interviewed for a story in the Pender, Nebraska paper.  How 'bout that?  When I was riding through town, a guy pulled up alongside me. Guy: "Where are you headed?" Me: "Maine." Guy: "Where'd you start?" Me: "Seattle." Guy: "Which way are you headed out of town?" Me, confused as to why he would ask that question: "North." Five minutes later, at a gas station on the north side of town (I stopped for a Gatorade, the third of the day), a lady came in and asked if I was the one riding across the country (she saw the bike leaned up against the wall outside).  She works for the local paper, and the guy that I talked to earlier is her dad, the owner of the paper.  So, she interviewed me and said that she'd send the paper with the story to me (she's sending it to my parent's place, where I'll be in less than two weeks).  Hopefully I'm not misquoted ("Yeah, I usually ride between seven and ten miles a day.  During this heat, I only ride between 2 and 6 pm.")    After the interview, she snapped a few photos of me outside with the rig.  When she was finished, I snapped one of her.  However, it wasn't that seamless - The Pig was being mischievous.  Not a second after I took her picture, The Pig gave a twitch and the whole rig almost came crashing down on her.  Fortunately, she escaped with only a bit of grease on her leg from the chainrings.  Bad Pig!    The Ride:  Rode north out of North Bend on Rt 79 to Snyder, where I took a left (west) on Rt ? to Dodge.  From Dodge I headed north then east to West Point, where I turned left (north) on Rt 9 to Pender and then Emerson. According to mapquest.com, it's 72 miles from Emerson to Sioux Center, the start of RAGBRAI.  Yikes.  Better get an early start tomorrow. Song-in-my-head of the Day:  Hey Jude by The Beatles.  It was played in a movie I saw a couple of nights ago (The Royal Tenenbaums), and it stuck.
The Ride:  Rode northeast from Emerson on Rt 35 through Hubbard and into Iowa after crossing the Missouri River.  From Sioux City (right on the river), I headed north on Rt K22 to Rt C12, where I took a right (east), and rode through Craig and Struble to Rt 60.  I rode Rt 60 northeast for a bit to Rt K64, where I headed north into Orange City. The stretch from Sioux City to Orange City was hot and fast, and I bonked.  I had the wind behind my back, but it was blowing at the same speed that I was riding (about 15 mph), so I didn't get to take advantage of the cooling effect from the wind.  I was hoping for a store in Craig to get something solid in my stomach - nope.  Struble - get outta here.  So, I pushed it the whole way to Orange City, where I pulled in to the first store I saw (a Casey's, of course) and ate a Snickers and drank a Gatorade.  The last ten miles into Orange City were not pretty - I wanted food, and I couldn't have it!    It's now 95 deg. F and 56% relative humidity.  Just stupid hot.  At 95 deg. F, Salt Lake City rarely gets above 14% RH.  It's supposed to cool down in a couple of days (only 85!), so there's that. Song-in-my-Head of the Day:  Something by The Beatles.  I read The Beatles Anthology at the Emerson library yesterday.  I could think of worse songs to have in my head.  Phil Collins comes to mind.
   The Ride:  Rode east from Orange City on Rt 10 through Alton and Granville to Rt 143, where I (we!) turned south to Marcus.  Rt 143 turned into Rt L36, and when we reached Rt C38, we turned east to Cherokee. Somewhere along the ride, I saw a big plume of white smoke up ahead.  I thought, "Is that what I think it is?"  Sure enough, two miles later, I passed Pork Chop.  I didn't stop to partake in pork, since I just finished eating six pancakes (all you can eat!).  I'm thinking of eating just pork for a day, see how that goes.  Pork products and Gatorade - mmm. There is so much food and drink along the ride, it's all easy.  Lots of all-you-can-eat deals to choose from, the library is open 'til 8 (on a Sunday!) just for Ragbrai, and there's bands playing in town tonight. Song-in-my-head of the Day:  Higher Ground by Stevie Wonder.  It was playing on a lady's radio that was attached to her bike. Favorite t-shirt phrases: Gears are for wimps (worn by a guy riding a single-speed cruiser) No drafting off the fat guy! (worn by a fat guy) Rehab is for quitters (worn by a waitress in a Marcus bar - the bar was packed, people were drinking, and it was 10 am)
The Ride:  Rode east from Cherokee through Rembrandt (pop. 228), Marathon (pop. 302), Webb (pop. 165), and Ayrshire (pop. 202) to Emmetsburg, via the following roads (make sure and pay close attention to this): M10, C25, M27, C16, M36, C25, M54, C13, M54, B63, N14, B53, N18, B53, and Rt 2.  Got that?    Along the way I stopped to pee in a cornfield.  When I was about 30 feet into the cornfield I remembered that cornfields are very scary places, and I was glad that I found my way out. At Marathon I stopped for lunch (two pork burgers - when in Rome ...), and watched a great blues band.  Turns out the bass player used to be in the Sun Dogs, a reggae band that used to play in Ames, Iowa (where I went to college (Iowa State) back in the early 90's), so I had that going for me. Webb was probably my favorite town, as they had bikes strapped 10 feet above the ground to the telephone poles that lined the main street.  And, they were selling Gatorades for $1.  Can't pass that up.    Speechless, mouth-gaped-open moments: 1. At breakfast, I watched a lady playing "Take Me Out To The Ball Game" on accordion while her friend from the choir sang along in a voice that was heavy on vibrato and sustain. 2. I saw a guy carrying his dog on his bike, in a child carrier.  A cute little white puppy. 3. I saw and talked to a guy that's riding RAGBRAI on a bike without a seat.  He's standing up the whole way, grinding away with his 60-tooth big ring (that's big - my big ring is 44 teeth).  I asked him if he uses different muscles than when he rides with a seat, and he said, "I dunno, I never use a seat."  I nodded, and then backed away slowly and quietly. 4. Just before entering Ayrshire, I saw four older ladies tap dancing on the concrete front porch of a house.
The Ride: Rode from Emmetsburg through Fenton, Lone Rock, Titonka, Woden, and Crystal Lake to Forest City via a bunch of two-lane country roads.    I definitely feel different riding in RAGBRAI than on my own. On my own, I look around at the scenery, keep a steady pace - it's generally meditative. Riding in RAGBRAI, there's always someone beside you, so lots of talking, lots of speeding up and slowing down, and lots of stopping. In the overnight towns there's usually bands playing, lots of food, and multiple beer gardens.  The main campground is close to town (within a couple of miles), but most people stand in line to take a shuttle bus from camp to town instead of riding their bikes, which baffles me.   
Bad joke of the day, as told by the singer of a band playing in Nora Springs:  What is the definition of endless love?  Stevie Wonder and Ray Charles playing tennis.  (I think some people hurled some stuff at the stage after hearing that one) It's easy to spend a lot of money at RAGBRAI, or put another way, it would be quite different to ride RAGBRAI with a big wad of cash.  A $4 pork tenderloin here, a $2 Gatorade there, and let's not forget the $3 pie, and hey you can't pass up ice cream for $1, and before you know it, you're out $20 easy for the day, and that's without spending money on many beers.  D'oh! The town of Bolan, pop. 80, baked 96 pies for Plymouth to sell, so I had to have one. I saw the Tubador playing in Charles City, a guy with a tuba and a tambourine.  He's got a CD for sale, but I didn't buy one since I had already spent enough money on food. In Charles City they had a "tug-of-war" contest that involved the fire department, a keg of sumthin', and willing volunteers from the crowd.  The keg was suspended about 20' in the air on rollers on a wire (it could move along the wire), and near each end of the wire was a guy from the fire department with a hose and a kid from the crowd, and the object was to spray the keg to the other end of the wire.  Wow - that was difficult to explain, and reading it again, I don't think it makes sense.  Whatever.  How 'bout a picture?    If I were to ride RAGBRAI again, I think it'd be fun to do it with a gang of people that I know, with a support van or bus.  I'd still use the BOB trailer, but it would be used for towing a stereo system, or maybe a cooler for refreshing mixed drinks (margaritas with a pedal-powered mixer?), or maybe a midget playing a ukulele (the trailer has a pesky 70 pound weight limit). Food for the day:  When I crossed I-35 (85 miles north of Ames), I ate a granloa bar.  Then I had a turkey sandwich, slice of pizza, and a piece of rhubarb pie with ice cream in Plymouth, a veggie dog and baked beans in Rudd, and an all-you-can-eat lasagna dinner provided by the Methodist Church in Charles City.   
   The Ride:  Rode from Charles City to Oelwein via Nashua, Tripoli, and Sumner. In Nashua I rode by the hug-a-pig booth. $1 gets you a squealing little piglet to hold for a bit.  Only in Iowa. Today I hopped on to the tail end of a few groups of riders, and man it was fun.  I've never really done that before.  While I'd be poking along at 15 mph on the flats, I'd look in my rearview mirror until I'd see a big group (~10 riders) coming up behind me, then just as they'd pass I'd speed up a bit and hop on the train.  It was amazing - I was riding at 22 mph with hardly any effort, with my front wheel about 6" behind the rear wheel of the rider in front of me.    Usually there's kids hanging out along the side of the street that give the riders high-fives as they're riding into town.  Well, riding into Sumner a guy in front of me was going to give a kid a high five.  At the last second, the kid (accidentally, I hope) moved and got smacked in the forehead instead of the hand.  He didn't look hurt, just a bit shocked.  Funny, it sounded just like a hand slap.   
I'm not the pheasant pluckerI'm the pheasant plucker's sonI'm just here plucking pheasants'Til the pheasant plucker comes (memorize, then sing out loud in front of your friends - hah!) The Ride:  Rode from Oelwein to Anamosa via Stanley, Aurora, Winthrop, Quasqueton, Troy Mills, and Central City.    I don't think RAGBRAI would work in any other state.  The people here are so nice, and the little towns really do a good job of creating a festive atmosphere.  It's like you're in a bike parade for a week.  At some of the intersections, the State Troopers would shoot passing cyclists with water guns.  Better than real guns, I suppose, but not as exciting.   
The Ride:  Rode from Anamosa to Bellevue via Amber, Scotch Grove, Canton, Andrew, and Springbrook.    Due to the rain, the road was almost deserted today.  A lot of riders hopped in their team van or bus, and drove home or to the end of the ride.  The ride was quite hilly (~2,800' of cumulative climbing), and very scenic. It was so humid that my fingers were slipping off the shifters when I'd go to shift. I hooked up with another group of riders heading east, and we camped along the banks of the Mississippi river, right near a lock and dam where barges were traveling through all night.
The Ride: We rode south on Rt 52 to Sabula, where we crossed the Mississippi over a scary high bridge with steel grating that you could look down through and see the water, into Savanna, Illinois.  From there we headed east on Rt 52 to Mt. Carroll, then southeast on Rt 40 through Chadwick and Milledgeville to a lovely quiet road that took us into Dixon.    We rode into Dixon as the sun was setting, and the ride just before Dixon was great.  Tall corn and lots of silos.  The corn in Iowa and western Illinois looks way healthier than the corn in Nebraska.  In Iowa and Illinois there is little to no irrigation, whereas in Nebraska they're throwing water in the air everywhere to water the crops. Rt 52 in Illinois wasn't a pleasant road, and a car that was passing us clipped the driver's side mirror off a car that was coming the other way.  The car that got clipped was swerving all over the road after the accident, and it was scary to see it swerving in my rearview mirror. After we stopped for lunch in Savanna, we saw another bike tourer, and he joined us for the ride to Dixon.  So, with Anthony, the mob grew to seven. We left Bellevue at 10 am, and arrived in Dixon at 8 pm.  However, we only rode for six hours, which means we had four hours worth of breaks.  It was great kicking back in the shade and hanging out with the group.  I'm glad I met up with them - they're a great bunch.   
   The Ride: Rode northeast from Dixon on Rt 2 to Flagg Road, where we turned east to Flagg Center and Rochelle.  From there we took Rt 38 to Dekalb and then Rt 23 northeast to Sycamore.  Sycamore is where we picked up a rail trail that parallells Rt 64, and we rode that into St. Chuck.    At the trailhead in St. Charles, my mom was waiting for us.  She rode with us for the last 2-1/2 miles from the trailhead to their place, where I lived for the last two years of high school.  It was great riding with her, even though she was riding a bit fast for us (!).  Good job, mom!  For those last miles, The Mob was nine, and we were pretty much invincible. I'll be hanging out in St. Charles for the next week or so, eating a lot, hanging out with the family, and going to baseball games and amusement parks.    Andrew is peeling off from The Mob to continue pedaling around the Midwest, and the rest are continuing east after doing laundry, taking showers, and working on their bikes in St. Charles.  I'm going to miss them when they take off, and it will definitely feel different when I'm riding by myself.  Sprocket, Pantano, Arial, Erin, Sarah, and Randy (left to right in the photo), it was great to meet you, and I wish you continued success in your travels.  Happy trails!   
The Ride:  Rode east from St. Charles on the Illinois Prairie Path Geneva Spur to the Timber Ridge Forest Preserve, where I hooked up with the Great Western Trail and continued east.  About ten miles west of downtown Chicago, in Maywood, the trail ended, and I took Washington Blvd for the rest of the way to Grant Park.  On the way back, I branched off the Great Western Trail in Villa Park and took the main Illinois Prairie Path and the Elgin Branch back to St. Charles. Song-in-my-head of the Day:  "Roll With The Changes" by R.E.O. Speedwagon.  Kate, Dan, Molly, and I went to Great America on Thursday (a Six Flags amusement park), and we heard that song in the car on the way there.  Oh yes, it stuck. When I got back to St. Charles, we went to a baseball game (the Kane County Cougars).  They lost, but it was a great game, and after the game we were treated to a few parachuters that landed on the field, and a spectacular fireworks show.  Fortunately, they waited to do the fireworks until after the parachuters had landed.  At the game, the announcer proclaimed over the loudspeakers, "Dave Mosen is joining us at today's game.  Dave rode his bike all the way from Washington!"  The crowd didn't go wild, but I still got a bit red in the face.
   The next few days I'm visiting a bunch of family, and I'm excited.  Tomorrow I'm riding to New Lenox, IL to visit cousins Cathy and Jim Condon, Friday I'll be in Dowagiac, MI to visit Aunt MaryAnn and Uncle Maurice and their kids and grandkids, and then Saturday I'll be in Kalamazoo to visit Uncle Tom and Aunt Arlene, and Uncle Buzz and Aunt Rosemary.  Busy schedule!
   The Ride:  Rode south on a bike/ped path along the Fox River through Geneva, Batavia, and North Aurora to Aurora, where the path ended and I headed generally southeast on busy two-lane roads through Plainfield and Lockport to New Lenox.    The traffic from Aurora to New Lenox was non-stop.  Where are all these people going?!?  Three guys in a pick-up truck yelled "faggot!" at me when they passed me in Plainfield.  It was pretty funny. In New Lenox I visited my cousin Cathy, her husband Jim, and their 2-year old Elizabeth, who was highly entertaining, as usual.  When asked to sing "Twinkle Twinkle Little Star", she sings "Papa Was A Rolling Stone" instead.  A true Chicago gal.  Cathy made pork chops, mashed potatoes, and corn for dinner, and Elizabeth decided to bypass the potatoes and sample the butter straight from the tub.    Song-in-my-head of the Day: Sleep on the Left Side by Cornershop.
Temperature-wise, today was ideal.  It never rose above 75, so I just kept riding, and riding, and ... The Ride:  Rode east from New Lenox through Frankfort and Matteson on the Old Plank Road Trail (a beautiful rail trail), to Park Forest, where the trail ended and I headed south on Orchard Rd to Steger Rd.  I took Steger Rd east through Sauk Village to the IL-IN border.  After the border, I took a variety of two-lane roads through Schererville, Merrilville, and Valparaiso to Kingsbury, where I camped off the side of a quiet dirt road.    There is a vast difference between the quality of roads in Porter County (Valparaiso area) and Laporte County (Kingsbury area).  The Porter County roads are bumpy cracked poorly-patched asphalt, but the Laporte County roads are smooth blacktop.  Go Laporte!  Trust me! Song-in-my-Head of the Day:  Keep On Rocking in the Free World by Neil Young.
The Ride:  Rode NE from Kingsbury on a buncha quiet roads to Chicago Rd, which turned into Bertrand Rd after crossing the IN-MI border.  I turned north on Rt 51 and rode through Niles to Sumnerville, where I took the Indian Lake Road north to 95th Ave.  I took 95th Ave east between Big Crooked Lake and Cable Lake, then east on Karl St to Aunt MaryAnn and Uncle Maurice's place, on the north shore of Magician Lake. After the ride, I spent the afternoon tooling around Magician Lake with Uncle Maurice, and eating dinner with him, Aunt MaryAnn, her niece Serena, and her niece's boyfriend Tim.  My cousin Jill, her husband Dan, and their kids Erica, Danny, and Andrew showed up later, and we stayed up until 1 am talking, drinking, and watching and listening to the nighttime boat traffic.  It was a great day.    Song-in-my-Head of the Day:  Ballroom Blitz by Sweet.
Today was a fast day (14.0 mph avg), but it didn't feel like I was going that fast.  What gives? The Ride:  Rode east from Magician Lake on the Territorial Rd to Decatur, where I took a bunch of two-lane roads to Schoolcraft.  From there I made my way north to Portage and then Kalamazoo to my Uncle Tom and Aunt Arlene's place.    I had dinner with Uncle Tom, Aunt Arlene, their son Andy, Uncle Buzz, and Aunt Rosemary.  Cousin Matt stopped by, and it was a big family fest for a while.  I'm really getting into this family-to-family bike touring.  Tomorrow I'll be staying with Tom and Arlene's daughter Monica, so I've got that going for me.   
The Ride:  Rode east out of Kzoo on N Av to 34th St, where I did a quick jog left then right (I had time to jog) on MN Ave.  I passed a bit south of Battle Creek, and hooked up with Michigan Ave in Marshall, which I took all the way to Monica and Jon's place.    Just outside of Kalamazoo I passed by the Kalamazoo Container Division of Green Bay Packaging (my dad works for Green Bay) on E Kilgore.  I waved to the building - why not? In Marshall I saw a black squirrel.  Apparently they're popular in this area of Michigan. Monica and Jon have a six-year old chocolate lab named Willie that's everything a six-year old chocolate lab should be, and a cat named Spot that has six toes on each paw.  With those big paws, she's quite effective at "making biscuits".  Monica made lasagna for dinner, and I had to limit myself to three pieces in order to avoid those astonished, embarrassing looks that I know all too well. Song-in-my-Head of the Day:  T.G.I.F.U. by Babe The Blue Ox
   I rode right by the Michigan International Speedway in Brooklyn, and I was amazed at the size of the bleachers.  Race fans!  Sunday, Sunday, Sunday!  I fail to see the attraction of watching other people drive cars around a track for hours on end, but hey, that many fans can't be wrong, right?  Left turns! At the intersection of routes 156 and 34 in Michigan, I stopped for ice cream and a Gatorade at a gas station.  The cashier saw me pull in on the bike, we talked for a bit, and then: Me: "So, how far to the Michigan-Ohio border from here?" Cashier:  "Oh, about fifteen minutes." Me, looking for some clarification:  "Fifteen miles?" Cashier, looking confused:  "Uh, yeah." It's interesting that we often measure distances in units of time, and vice versa ("How long until we're there?" "Oh, ten miles."). At the Napoleon library, I heard someone almost shout, "Where's the bike tourer?" from the other side of the library.  Yikes!  Take cover!  It was a fireball named Jack, and he's quite a character.  Went into a coma in November of '97, came out in March of '98, rode his bike across country with his son (from Seattle to Washington, D.C.) in the summer of '99, and he's now running for congress.  He's 73 years old.
The Ride:  Rode east from Napoleon on Rt 110 to Grand Rapids, where I peeled off the main drag and followed a bunch of quiet two-lane roads through Tontogany, Bowling Green, Pemberville, Gibsonburg, Fremont, Clyde, and Avery to Huron.  Between Fremont and Clyde I rode the North Coast Inland Trail, a paved rail-trail.    The only sign posted in the men's toilet room at the Pemberville IGA: "Pick up after yourself.  Please keep your shoes off the toilet rim.  Thank you."  That baffled me - I wonder what happened that made the management post that sign?  Shoes on the toilet rim?  Hmm ... Huron is right on Lake Erie.  As I was pulling into town, I was in my usual find-a-shower-then-find-the-library mode since it was warm and I was stinky, but then I saw the sign for the public beach.  Beach!  I forgot - I'm near a big body of water!  It was so nice.  I swam in Lake Erie for a long time.  The water temperature was great, and there was a nice breeze to keep the bugs away.  After swimming for about a half hour and reading a book for an hour, I set up camp a couple miles east of town. Song-in-my-Head of the Day:  Sugar by System Of A Down.
Today was a beautiful ride along the southern shore of Lake Erie.  The next few days should be the same, as I'll be right next to Lake Erie all the way into New York.  Hope the lake doesn't catch on fire - wait, those were the old days. The Ride:  Rode east from Huron on Rt 6 through Vermilion, Lorain, Sheffield Lake, Avon Lake, Bay Village, Rocky River, and Lakewood to Cleveland, where I snaked my way to Shaker Heights, a town just southeast of Cleveland. I'm using the Adventure Cycling maps from here to Maine, and then from Maine to at least Richmond, Virginia, and I was glad to be using them today.  Winding through Cleveland was a bit of a challenge with all the twists and turns, but the route was safe and easy. The highlight of the day was visiting the home that I lived in from late 1970 to late 1974 (I was born in April of 1970), in Bay Village.  The house is still the same, the only thing that's changed is the landscaping (a few trees died and were removed to brighten up the place and reduce the number of mosquitoes, and the sandpit that we played in is no longer there).  I knocked on the door, an older lady answered, and we chatted for not even a minute.  With my shaggy hair sticking out from the bandanna on my head, and me stinking up the neighborhood, she was a bit on guard, and I heard the lock click when she shut the door.  Hmm. The neighbor in the house to the east of our old house heard my conversation with the older lady, and she and I talked for a bit.  Her name is Donna McAnn, and she moved in a few months before we moved out.  Unprompted, she said, "I remember your cat Moselle."  Wha?!?  How does she remember the cat?  That was a bit strange to hear from, basically, a stranger.  It was great talking with her, and before I left I took a bunch of photos of the old house.  Of course, everything in the neighborhood looks much smaller.      Tonight I'm staying with friends Kristin and Eric in Shaker Heights, a beautiful town with lots of big, old, well-designed homes.  Kristin is a good friend of my sister-in-law Molly.  They've got a cute 6-month old Bernese mountain dog named Sophie that's really well-behaved, but still likes to gnaw on rugs when no one is looking.
The Ride:  Rode east from Shaker Heights on S Woodland Rd to Gates Mills Blvd, which I took northeast to Gates Mills. Heart-stopping moment: lost my Palm Pilot at the library.  D'oh!  Someone was nice enough to turn it in at the lost and found.  Whew!  How 'bout that?
The Ride:  Rode north from Gates Mills on Rt 174 to Rt 84, otherwise known as Johnnycake Ridge Rd, where I turned right (east).  I used to live near the intersection of Johnnycake Ridge Rd and Johnnycake Rd (call me Johnnycake), in Mentor, but I didn't see that intersection as I was riding.  Willoughby, where I was born, is just west of Mentor, so today's ride had a bit of History of Dave.  I took Johnnycake Ridge Rd to Painesville, took Rt 84 to Madison, turned north at Unionville, and hooked up with Lake Rd.  Lake Rd hugs the southern shore of Lake Erie, and I rode that through Geneva-on-the-Lake, Ashtabula, Conneaut, into Pennsylvania, and through Lake City to Fairview, where I camped for the night.    Higlight of the day:  In Ashtabula I bought 3,460 calories of food for only $3.48.  That's a lot of energy. Song-in-my-Head of the Day:  Jealous Again by the Black Crowes While reading the paper at the grocery store in Fairview, I learned that The Smithereens were playing tonight in Erie, at a downtown festival.  D'oh!  Since I was already showered, Erie was still 16 miles east of Fairview, and they didn't start playing 'til 10 pm, I didn't hop on the bike and continue east to see them.  But I almost did. I camped between two farms, in a lovely grassy area that was surrounded by trees (read: no one could see me).  As I was hanging out at camp, a kitty, probably from one of the farms, came over to say hi.  It slept on my lap as I was reading.  Soooo cute.
The Ride:  Continued east from Fairview on Lake Rd through Erie, into New York, through Barcelona (or, as Ruben Farr would say, Barcelonia), Dunkirk, Silver Creek, and Irving to Point Breeze.    Song-in-my-Head of the Day:  Girl Like You by the Smithereens In Point Breeze I hung out near the beach to watch the sunset.  It was nice - I worked on my bike a bit, adjusting the brakes and cleaning the drivetrain, and watched the sunset before returning to camp.
The Ride:  Continued east from Point Breeze on the Lake Rd to Lackawanna, where I took South Park Ave to Buffalo.  I crossed the Peace Bridge into Fort Erie (Canada!), then rode the Niagara Recreation Trail northwest to Niagara Falls.  After hanging out there for a bit, watching water fall and getting sprayed by the mist, I took the Lewiston-Queenston Bridge back into the US, and took Upper Mountain Road east through Pekin to Lockport. At Niagara Falls I went to the gift shop and bought some funny looking Canadian candy.  Next time you're in Canada, check out the candy.  Trust me.    The highlight of the day was crossing over the bridge back into the US from Canada.  Auto and truck traffic was backed up on the bridge, and I cruised right between the lanes, ooh yeah.  Luckily, no one on the right side decided to open their driver's side door - oof!    In Lockport I camped in luxury behind the Wide Water Drive-In restaurant near the public marina along the Erie Canal.  Free camping for bike tourers, free showers, and greazy food.  I hung out at the canal, talked to a bunch of folks, and watched the beach chickens (seagulls) feed on litter. Song-in-my-Head of the Day:  Tennessee by Arrested Development
   At some point along the ride, can't remember where, I had to take a detour off the trail.  As I was riding along the road with cornfields on each side, a deer popped its head out of the cornfield.  It was funny - all I saw was a deer head, like it was mounted to a cornstalk. I pulled in to Brockport at 2 pm and decided that I was finished riding for the day.  Brockport is a cute town, as are most of the towns along the canal, and it has a great bike shop, main street, and library, so I had that going for me.  I bought a new tire for The Pig, since the old one was all cracked.  The bike's rear tire is another story: it has NO tread, and is cracked as well.  It needs to be changed bad, but if it ain't broke don't fix it, so I'll wait to change it until the next flat. I had burritos at camp that were so good I could barely stand it.  Refried beans with green chiles, shredded cheese, corn, tortillas, ooh yeah.
The Ride:  Continued east along the Erie Canalway Trail through Spencerport, Rochester, Pittsford, Fairport, and Macedon to Palmyra, where the trail ended and I was shocked by the harshness of the road.  So much traffic!  Such hard surfaces!  Where'd the wildlife go?  From Palmyra I took a bunch of two-lane roads north through Marion and Williamson to Pultneyville, where I hit Lake Ontario and couldn't go north no more.  Where Lake Erie has vineyards, Lake Ontario has orchards.  I turned east on Lake Rd and rolled in to Sodus Point.    I like the name Sodus.  I think it'd be a cool name for a dog.  Maybe some kind of retriever, or sumthin'. I stopped at a gas station in Pittsford to use their toilet, and was impressed by the amount of stuff they had crammed in the 6'x8' toilet room.  There was a furnace, a 40 gallon water heater, a toilet, and a sink, and amazingly there was still plenty of room to move around.  I'm sure it wasn't ADA compliant, and a few building code regulations may be violated here and there, but wow! At Sodus Point I hung out at the beach for a long while.  It was a beautiful afternoon - cool, cloudless, enough of a breeze to keep the flies away.  For some reason, Lake Ontario feels bigger than Lake Erie.  I showered in the bath house (seems appropriate, huh?), read a book for a while, then left at around 6 pm to find a campsite. I found a lovely campsite in an apple orchard - just me, the apples, and the slugs.  As soon as I set up camp, the slugs were all over my stuff.  Yes, the willies surfaced again.  I listened to the Yankees play the Angels on the radio as I made dinner (Velveeta shells & cheese with a small can of tuna and a small can of mixed vegetables, down the hatch). Song-of-the-Day in my Head:  The Distance by Cake
   In Clay I'm meeting a friend who drove from Salt Lake City (Suzi), and we're going to hang out in Clay, drive down to NYC to visit her cousin, etc. for the next week or so.  Suzi's parents live in Clay, so how convenient is that!  Her dad wins my vote for nicest guy on the planet.  I arrived in Clay at around 2:30 pm, and this is the conversation that took place right after I parked the rig: Don:  "Hey hey, what can I get you to drink?" Me:  "Oh, 7-up sounds good."  He brings me a 2-liter of Sprite! Don:  "What about to eat?  A sandwich?  Pizza?  C'mon, you must be hungry!" Me:  "Well, pizza sounds good ..."  Almost before I could finish the sentence, he was in the car and off to buy me a pizza. In Clay I'm going to replace the chain and rear cassette (8-speed 11-28) on the bike.  It's not skipping, but the chain is definitely stretched. Song-in-my-Head of the Day:  Revolution #9 by The Beatles
In Clay, Suzi and I went to the New York State Fair to eat salt potatoes and look at the animals (human and otherwise), then we went to NYC for a few days.  Highlight of the trip:  I bought a pumice thing at The Body Shop in NYC for my nasty cracked feet, ooh yeah.  In NYC we spent some time in the Brooklyn emergency room, flip flopped around Central Park, attended gospel church in Queens before driving to the eastern tip of Long Island (quite a contrast!), iced a hyperextended knee (separate incident), etc.      The Ride:  Rode east from Clay on Rt 31 through Cicero, Bridgeport, and Lakeport to South Bay, where I turned left onto Rt 13.  I rode Rt 13 north through Verona Beach, Sylvan Beach, Vienna, McConnellsville, and Camden to a thin grey road that took me through Florence to Osceola, where I called it a day.  The quads started screaming at me in Camden.    Song-in-my-Head of the Day:  Time For Me To Fly by R.E.O. Speedwagon
The Ride: Rode east from Osceola on Osceola Rd through West Leyden to Boonville, where I turned on to Moose River Rd.  Moose River Rd parallels the Moose River!  I rode east to McKeever, where I turned NE on Rt 28 through Thendara to Old Forge.  At Old Forge I turned on to South Shore Rd, and rode that to Inlet.  South Shore Rd follows the south shore of the Fulton Chain Lakes!    Old Forge must be the schnick-schnock (bric-a-brac, knickknock, etc.) capital of the US.  Lots of arty stores, with little wood carvings, ornaments, etc.  I ate lunch at Old Forge, mostly because I couldn't pass up such fantastic people-watching. At Old Forge, I met the west edge of the Adirondack Mountains.  They were laughing at me - c'mon punk.     
The Ride:  Rode east from Inlet on Rt 28 through Raquette Lake to Blue Mountain Lake, where I turned north onto Rt 28N.  I rode Rt 28N through Long Lake to Newcomb, where I turned east onto Rt 2.  In North Hudson, after riding under I-87, I turned north on Rt 9 to Rt 4, which I rode east for a bit to camp. In Newcomb I ate lunch within sight of Vanderwhacker Mountain (3,386').  I like to say that, as well as type that:  Vanderwhacker Mountain. Song-in-my-Head of the Day:  Anna Begins by Counting Crows I found a great campsite off of Rt 4.  Very little traffic on Rt 4 to bug me, and the distant drone of Rt 87 lulled me to sleep.  After I set up the tent, cleaned the bike chain, etc., I decided to take a walk around camp, and noticed that I was camped within 50' of a swamp.  D'oh!  Since there was no breeze, a bunch of mosquitoes were bugging me, but they were no match for a couple sticks of Nag Champa (incense).   
Ride uphill at 4 mph for two minutes, thinking ticka-ticka-ticka.  Then ride downhill at 30 mph for fifteen seconds, hands up high and screaming.  Repeat for six hours.  With 28 gears to choose from, I think would've been just fine today with the lowest gear and the highest gear.    The Ride:  Rode east from my lovely campsite on Rt 4 to Moriah, where I hopped on Rt 42 for the rest of the way to Port Henry.  From there I rode south on Rt 9N to a road that crosses Lake Champlain via Champlain Bridge into Chimney Point, Vermont.  I stayed along the east shore of Lake Champlain through Panton to Vergennes, where I turned north on Rt 22A.  Just past Ferrisburg, I hopped on to Greenbush road, which parallels Rt 7 but is much better for biking (read: not as much traffic), and passed through Charlotte to Shelburne, where I hopped on to Rt 7 for the rest of the way into Burlington.    It had been a few days since I showered (I don't shower much), so I held my breath and paid $4 (!) for a foo-foo shower at a health club in Shelburne.  That shower was perhaps the best of the trip - I had my choice of herbal good-for-yer-hair shampoos, and a cotton towel!  Wow! Song-in-my-Head of the Day:  Alright Hear This by the Beastie Boys At the health club, I learned that I've gained one pound since the last time I weighed myself (Helena, Montana).  I've ballooned from 159 lbs to 160 lbs! I think I got a bit too close to Burlington before deciding to look for a campsite.  It took me a while, and in the interest of setting up camp, cooking, and eating before dark, I settled on a spot in a field in the 'burbs, within plain sight of six houses.  Not the best campsite, but it's home.
I spent the morning at the Library, then farted around town for the afternoon before heading out to find a campsite.  I ate dinner at the Vermont Pub and Brewery, and had an IPA.  I was going to have a porter, but summertime was still rolling.
6 am:  Wake up after eight hours of sleep.  Go back to sleep. 7:30 am:  Wake up, damnit.  Pack everything up.  It's a windy morning.  Shove off by 8:30 am. 9:30 am:  Stop in Richmond at a bakery / cafe for breakfast.  I had an everything bagel sandwich with a fried egg, cheese, and prosage (vegetarian sausage, ooh yeah).  Read the Burlington paper for a bit.  It's a cloudy day. 10:30 am:  Ride along lovely two-lane country roads through the Green Mountains.  I think that Vermont is greener than, dare I say it, Oregon (gasp!).  Pass a graveyard with the tombstone of somebody that died in 1813. 12 pm:  25 miles and 2,700' of elevation gain later, I'm huffing and puffing at the top of Appalachian Gap (2,356'), or Ap Gap as the locals call it.  For the last half-mile to the top, it's at least a 10% grade.  In Vermont, they're gaps, not passes.  I miss the passes - the last one I did before the Ap Gap was in the Black Hills of South Dakota.  I'm out of practice, though - I forgot my celebratory candy bar for the top.  D'oh!  The clouds have broken up, and it's a bright, sunshiney day.  The Long Trail crosses the road at the top.  I don't know how far south the trail extends, but the sign says that it's 108.9 miles from Ap Gap to Canada along the trail.  Start the long and well-deserved descent to Warren.    1:30 pm:  Stop in Warren for lunch at a frou-frou general store.  Lunch:  two yogurts, an everything bagel, a bit of Vermont cheddar cheese, and a banana.  After lunch, a local guy and I were talking about my route to Maine, and he suggested an alternate way from Rochester to Bethel.  Between these two towns, the Adventure Cycling route takes me along a river, nice and gentle grade.  His suggestion was to ride up and over the ridge between the two towns, which is shorter than they AC route and has excellent views.  A sucker for a good pass, er, gap, I took his suggested route. 3:30 pm:  A few miles and 1,300' of elevation gain later, I'm at the top of the gap.  The views are breathtaking - I can see the White Mountains to the east, in New Hampshire.  Start the descent into Bethel, get the rig up to 47.5 mph. 4:30:  Bethel, chartered in 1779.  After filling up my stove fuel bottle with high-grade unleaded ($0.09), I asked the attendant if there's a grocery store in town.  She pointed at a little teeny building labeled Bethel General Market, and I'm thinking uh-oh, might be Ramen and Chili with Beans again.  Wrong - the market had everything I wanted, and then some.  The people were great - there were lots of people shopping, and everyone knew each other.  Since I stood out like a sore thumb (and stunk like one too), I talked with lots of locals.  A great place. 5:30 pm:  Find camp behind the local pool, a great spot on the lawn, nice and secluded.  I hopped the fence (the pool was closed), and showered in and outdoor shower - hot water! 6:15 pm:  Make and inhale dinner:  Velveeta Shells & Cheese with a can of tuna and a can of mixed veggies.  Dessert:  Junior Mints and a bag of pretzels. 6:45 pm:  After cleaning up, listen to the Yankees play the Indians on the radio for a bit before heading into the tent to escape the mosquitoes and read for a bit.  Right now I'm reading a book about the history of America, my dose of non-fiction.  Next up is a book of short stories from the New Yorker. 9 pm:  Stop reading, go to sleep. The Ride:  Rode east from Burlington on Rt 2 through Williston to Richmond, where I turned south on Main Rd through Huntington, Huntington Center, and Hanksville to Rt 17.  At Rt 17, I turned east and rode up and over Ap Gap.  On the way down, I passed the Mad River Glen ski area ("Ski It If You Can", as the bumper sticker says) and hit Rt 100 at Irasville.  I turned south on Rt 100 and rode through Warren, Granville, and Hancock to Rochester, where I turned east on a little road up and over the ridge to Bethel. Song-in-my-Head of the Day:  Wait by White Lion.  I know, it's terrible, and I have no idea how it got there.
Today I got to ride across two covered bridges - one just west of Thetford Center and the other just east of East Thetford.  Both were at the bottom of a hill, of course, and the surface of the first bridge was quite bumpy, which I couldn't see due to the shadows (remember, it's covered) - since I was cruising at top speed, I got tossed around a bit but managed to keep the rubber side down.  The second one - smooth as glass.  I rode back and forth over it a couple times.    The Ride:  Rode east from Bethel on Rt 7 to Sharon, where I hooked up with Rt 132 and rode that through South Strafford to Tucker Hill Rd.  I took Tucker Hill Rd through Thetford Center, Thetford Hill, and under I-91 to East Thetford.  I crossed the Connecticut river, entered New Hampshire, and took the River Rd and then Rt 10 north through Orford, Piermont, and Haverhill to North Haverhill.  There I turned right (east) on Rt 116, which turned into Rt 112, and rode that up and over a pass (where the Appalachian Trail crosses, near Mt. Moosilauke) to North Woodstock and then Lincoln.    By the time I got to Lincoln, it was late.  I had 45 minutes to shop for dinner, find a campsite, set up camp, and cook before dark, but I managed to do it with minutes to spare.  I found a great campsite about 15' from the East Branch of the Penugewasset River.  The babble of the rapids lulled me to sleep and also drowned out the traffic noise. In Lincoln there was a Corvette gathering.  They were passing me all day. Highlight-of-the-Day:  On the descent into North Woodstock, I got the rig up to 52.5 mph, the new high speed of the Tour de Moser.  The Pig behaved and didn't give me any twitches. Song-in-my-Head of the Day:  "Last Stop: This Town" by the eels.
The last three miles of the ride up to the pass are 9% grade, and the first eight of the downhill are 7% grade.  The top was absolutely lovely - about 70 deg. F, light breeze, bright sunshine, and the view was huge.    The Ride:  Rode east from Lincoln (elev. 800') on Rt 12 up and over Kancamagus Pass (elev. 2,855'), then down through Conway and Center Conway on Rt 113 to Fryeburg, Maine (elev. 500'), where I ate lunch.  From Fryeburg I took Rt 5 northeast to Lovell, then Rt 93 east through Sweden to South Waterford, Rt 37 north east through Waterford and East Waterford, and finally Rt 118 east to Norway / South Paris. I haven't had a broken spoke on this trip, knock on wood.  In fact, I haven't even had to turn a spoke to true either the front or the rear wheels.  Before the trip, I laced a new rear wheel with a Mavic D521 downhill mountain bike rim.  It's way heavy, I remember I could feel the added rotational weight the first time I rode on it, but it's sturdy as hell, so I've got that going for me.

   The Ride:  Rode southeast from South Paris on Rt 119 through West Minot to Minot, where I turned east on Rt 121 into Auburn and then Lewiston.  After "showering", grocery shopping, and hanging out at a bookstore in Lewiston, I rode east for a bit on Rt 126 through Sabbatus to Rt 197 east, where I camped. One thing that I've noticed about people that live in Maine:  they don't talk much, and when they do, they usually say "no", or some variation of "no".  A conversation I had last night with a gas station attendant in South Paris: Me:  "Is there a pool or a health club in town?  Somewhere that I could take a shower?" Attendant:  "Nope."  After talking to him, I rode along main street and found a health club in South Paris. Me:  "How about a grocery store?  Is there one in town?" Attendant:  "Let's see - no."  There was a great little grocery store 1/4 mile down the road from the gas station. It was a hot day in Lewiston, and I needed to take a shower no matter what.  The YMCA and the YWCA were closed, there are no hostels or campgrounds in town, so I ended up "showering" in the bathroom of the Save-A-Lot grocery store.  Actually, it went great.  I won't get into details, but no one came in when I was "showering", which was a good thing, and I felt clean and refreshed after the "shower". I walked around the Save-A-Lot for a while, enjoying the air conditioning, buying lots of food, and reading ingredients of various foodstuffs.  See if you can guess the food item with the following ingredients (the answer will be revealed in tomorrow's entry, and no I did not buy it): Mechanically separated chicken, beef tripe, partially defatted cooked beef fatty tissue, beef hearts, water, partially defatted cooked pork fatty tissue, salt.  Less than 2%: mustard, natural flavorings, dried garlic, vinegar, dextrose, sodium erythorbate, sodium nitrite. At camp, it was hot.  Luckily, I bought a little battery-powered fan at the New York State Fair in Syracuse, and it worked great.  It fits perfectly in a little elastic hoop on the inside of the tent, and was aimed right at my head and chest.  Aaah, convection.
The Ride:  Rode east on Rt 197 from Sabbatus through Litchfield Corner and Richmond to Dresden, where I left Rt 197 for a bit to ride the Bog Rd and Rabbit Run Path before hooking up with Rt 194, which I rode through Alna to Rt 215.  I took Rt 215 southeast through Damariscotta Mills and Newcastle to Damariscotta, where I hooked up with Rt 1.  I rode Rt 1 through Waldoboro to Warren, where I hopped on Rt 90 through West Rockport and Rockport to Camden.  I found a great spot to camp at Camden Hills State Park, in full view of the water.    Just east of Dresden, as I was climbing a hill, I met a couple other bike tourers named Steve and Susann, but they were in a car, not on bikes.  We chatted for a bit, I was asking them lots of questions about their trip along the Continental Divide a couple months ago, and then they invited me to their place to rest for a bit.  As I just started the ride, I declined, but I'll probably take them up on their offer when I ride back from Acadia NP, on my way south to Key West.  I'm psyched to see their slide show of their trip this summer, and also just to hang out for a bit. Between Rockport and Camden I rode by a field with nothing but grass and belted galloways.  Rockport is located right on West Penobscot Bay, and about a mile from the water the temperature dropped and I could smell the sea.  Ooh yeah.  As I was riding through Rockport, I thought about how I just rode from the Pacific to the Atlantic oceans, and I smiled. In Camden I stopped at a bike shop to top off my tires, and I talked with the head mechanic / owner for a bit.  He seemed to know a lot about how hydrocarbons, ozonation, free radicals, and fully hydrogenated synthetic rubber (?) relate to the quality of tires.  Mostly I just nodded my head as my eyes glazed over. Song-in-my-Head of the Day:  Why You'd Want to Live Here by Death Cab For Cutie
According to the Bangor paper, the hottest town in the country yesterday was Fryeburg, Maine, at 98 deg. F.  I wasn't too far east from there.  It's hot, and the humidity is up around 2,754%. The Ride:  Rode east from Camden on an awfully busy Rt 1, with no shoulder.  It was the worst road I've been on so far.  After a stressful half hour, I reached Lincolnville and turned NW on a quiet road to Rt 52, where I turned east.  In Belfast, I hopped on to Rt 1 (this time with a nice, wide shoulder), and rode that through Searsport, Stockton Springs, Verona, Bucksport, Orland, and East Orland to Ellsworth.  I camped in a clear-cut area just south of town, along Rt 230.    I rode across a great big high oh-my-gosh bridge on the way into Verona, across the Penobscot River.  The best part: I get to ride it again, going the other way, in a couple of days.  Woo-hoo! Song-in-my-Head of the Day:  Perfect Candidate by Michael Penn
The Ride:  Rode south, alert and defiant, from Ellsworth on Rt 230 past the eerie kids to Goose Cove Rd, where I turned east to Trenton.  From there I took Rt 3 south onto Mount Desert Island, then east through Eden, Salsbury Cove, and Hulls Cove to the Acadia National Park visitor's center.  After gathering a bunch of maps and observing a minute of silence at 8:46 am, I headed into Bar Harbor to eat lunch.  From there I took Rt 233 west to Rt 198 and then Rt 102 south to Bernard.    A $20 gift certificate to Thurston's Lobster Pound was waiting for me at the Bar Harbor post office (general delivery).  Thanks, Mom & Dad!  Thurston's is located in Bernard, and I ate a 1.58 lb. lobster.  It was great, and I was in quite a food coma afterwards. At Thurston's there was a little kid there with his family.  He kept whining that he wanted his own lobster, but his Dad didn't get him one because all he'd do would play with it.  When the kid was playing with his Dad's lobster claw after the meat was out, he got his finger stuck in the claw and was screaming his head off.  It was kinda funny - the kid wasn't hurt, and most the people in the place were laughing.   
The Ride:  Rode south from Bernard on Rt 102A through Bass Harbor to Ship Harbor, where I did the nature walk.  Afterwards, I took Rt 102 north through Southwest Harbor and Somesville to Rt 198 east and then Rt 3 south to Sargent Drive, which hugs the eastern shore of Somes Sound, to Northeast Harbor.  After eating lunch in Northeast Harbor, I rode on carriage roads for the rest of the day. The carriage roads are great.  Rockefeller Jr. created them for non-motorized use back in the 1930's, and they have gentle grades, lots of shade, and no cars (nice for a change).    I woke up not feeling so hot - I had a sore throat and a headache.  The headache went away, but I had the sore throat all day, and was feeling kinda dizzy.  I found a great place to camp, right off a carriage road near Jordan Pond, so I set up camp kinda early, read a lot, didn't eat much, and went to sleep early.    Song-in-my-Head of the Day:  Down by 311
The Ride:  Rode from camp to the top of Cadillac Mountain on the paved road, then back down and clockwise around the Acadia NP Park Loop Road.  After doing the loop, I went back into Bar Harbor to eat lunch, then hopped on Rt 3 through Hulls Cove, Salisbury Cove, and Eden to get off the island and start snaking my way down the east coast.  I rode Rt 3 north into Ellsworth, then took Rt 172 south then west to Surry.    The word of the day would be "blustery".  The top of Cadillac Mountain (elev. 1,530', the highest point on the east coast) had a steady 20 mph wind from the SW, with gusts to 30 mph.  I didn't stay at the top too long - it was a real Griswolds-at-the-Grand-Canyon moment.  There were lots of people at the top - lots of tour buses and all that. I left The Pig at the bottom of the climb to Cadillac Mountain, and it made for an easy climb.  It felt so good that I left it for the Loop Road as well.  It's funny, I like the feel of the bike with The Pig attached, it's more stable, but I can definitely appreciate the added efficiency without that boat anchor dragging me down.  Without The Pig, the bike feels all loosey goosey.  The Loop Road was a nice ride, right along the coast. At the Bar Harbor grocery store I found a little bottle of Classico Basil Pesto, so I had that with some vermicelli for dinner.  It was great.  I didn't drink much water at camp, though, since the water smelled like sewer.  I've never had water that tasted as bad as that (I filled up the CamelBak and my water bottles at the General Store in Surry - consider yourself warned). Song-in-my-Head of the Day:  One Week by the Barenaked Ladies.  Awful, just awful.  That song entered my head in Bar Harbor, and would not let go until the Ellsworth grocery store.
The Ride:  Rode north from Surry on Rt 176 to Rt 1m which I took north and then west through East Orland, Orland, Bucksport, Verona, back over the great bridge outside Verona, Stockton Springs, Searsport, and Belfast.  At Belfast I hopped on Rt 52 and rode that to Lincolnville Center, where I turned west on Rt 235 and then south on Rt 105 to Camden.  In Camden I too Bayview St to the farm with the belted galloways, and I camped near a pond in that area.    Except for the pinecones falling all around me, the campsite was great.  Beautiful weather, and a nice view of the sunset, which happened right over the lake. Song-in-my-Head of the Day:  Drown by Smashing Pumpkins.  I heard the beginning of the song during the Red Sox game the other night.  Y'know that two-minute part at the very end, where the bass and drums are repeating that quiet 8-beat phrase and the guitars are all feeding back?  Yeah ...
The Ride:  Rode west from Camden on Rt 90 through Rockport, West Rockport, and Warren to Rt 1, which I took west through Waldoboro, Damariscotta, New Castle, and North Edgecombe to Wiscasset.  At Wiscasset, I veered off the ACA route to take Rt 27 north to Steve and Susann's place in Dresden. I met Steve and Susann on the way to Acadia, and I took them up on their offer for a place to stay on the way back.  It was great hanging out with them for the afternoon and evening.  They've done two west-to-east road cross-country bike tours so far, they were Traveling Trainers for Leave No Trace in 2000 and 2001 (they gave me a shovel to help with my Catholes Across America!), and they just got back from riding the Great Divide trail (which I'm hoping to ride next summer) from Canada to Mexico.  We drank beers and chatted about all that stuff in the afternoon, then ate a great dinner and ice cream a bit later.  Afterwards, they showed me their slide show of the Great Divide trip.    Song-in-my-Head of the Day:  Dragons Awake! by Guided By Voices
   The Ride:  Rode south from Steve & Susann's on Rt 127 to Woolwich, where I hopped back on the ACA route that took me on a bunch of backroads through Bath, New Meadows, Brunswick, and Freeport.  At Freeport, based on Steve's suggestion, I veered off the ACA route in order to ride through Portland (the ACA route makes a wide arc around Portland).  I took Rt 1 to Yartmouth, where I hopped on Rt 88 through Cumberland Foreside and Falmouth Foreside and then merged back on to Rt 1 into Portland.  I took the Casco Bay Bridge south out of Portland, then veered east to see the Portland Head Light at Fort Williams, the oldest lighthouse in Maine.  I continued on Rt 77 through Cape Elizabeth and Higgins Beach to Rt 207, which I took to Rt 1 and Scarborough.    In Portland, after eating at the largest grocery store of the trip so far, I spent some time riding around the downtown area, especially the Old Port area. Along the 1-mile Casco Bay Bridge, I saw a big rusty red ship called the Mekhanik Vraskov sitting in the bay.  It made me think of that time in 1993, in Bremerhaven, Germany, when my sister Kate, cousin Pat, and I ate cold fish and drank warm beer on a big rusty scary Russian ship. Song-in-my-Head of the Day:  Gett Off by Prince.
The Ride:  Rode south on Rt 1 fron Scarborough through West Scarborough, Saco, Biddeford, Kennebunk, Wells, Moody, Ogunquit, Cape Neddick, and Kittery to Portsmouth (New Hampshire), where I reconnected with the ACA route and took a bunch of two-lane country roads generally west through Exeter, Kingston, and Danville to East Berry.  I could've veered off of Rt 1 to ride a bit closer to the coast, and on quieter roads, but I really wanna get to Boston on Wednesday, so fast and noisy Rt 1 it is.  It wasn't so bad, there was a big wide shoulder, and lots of miniature golf places to look at.    In East Berry I camped right next to a big cemetery.  It was quite convenient, as the library and a general store were within short walking distance.  In the restroom of the general store, a sign was posted on the wall that read:  Stop - Peeing on the toilet seat "Please". Song-in-my-Head of the Day:  Pets by Porno For Pyros
The Ride:  Rode southwest from East Derry to a bunch of quiet, hilly 2-lane roads through West Windham to Rt 111, where, annoyed by all the turns that the ACA route had me taking, I veered off the route and stayed on Rt 111 southwest to Hudson.  In Hudson I hopped on Rt 3A south, entered Massachusetts, and rode through Tyngsburgh to North Chelmsford, where I turned south on to Rt 4.  In Chelmsford I turned onto Rt 27 and rode that through South Chelmsford and North Acton to Acton.  In Acton I got back on the ACA route for the rest of the way into Boston, and rode Rt 119, Strawberry Hill Rd, Barrett's Mill Rd, and Lowell Rd to Concord.  At Concord I turned on to Walden St., rode by Walden Pond, then traveled generally east on Baker Bridge Rd, Sandy Pond Rd, Trapelo Rd (said "hey" to the house where Steve Paige grew up), Smith Rd, Concord Ave, Mill St, Trapelo St, and Main St (lots of turns!) to Watertown, where I hopped on the Charles River Bike Path for the rest of the way into downtown Boston. By veering off the ACA route, I chopped off about ten miles and who knows how much elevation gain.  Besides, it's tough to get in a good bike touring groove when you're always looking the map and turning every mile on unsigned roads. The ride from Acton into Boston was simply lovely.  The weather was great, the roads were generally quiet, and I got to see a lot of historical stuff.  From Acton to Concord I followed the same route as the line of march of the Acton minutemen on April 19, 1775.  In Concord, I went out of my way to ride over North Bridge, the site where the Colonial militia men met the British Regulars, and where the "shot heard round the world" was fired. Song-of-the-Day in my Head:  Lionel Richie's version of Easy, by the Commodores. You know, "easy like Sunday morning."  I heard it in a 7-11 when I was filling up my CamelBak, and it stuck.    Today it struck me that it's usually one of three kinds of drivers that cut me off or pass too close: 1.  Drivers over 75 years old. 2.  Male drivers over 60 years old, driving SUVs. 3.  Drivers talking on their cell phones. Today I happened to see all three either cut me off or pass too close.
Now, when I saw "in Boston", I don't mean out in some damn suburb.  I stayed in a condo in Beacon Hill, a few doors north of Boston Common (on Walnut St, between Beacon St and Chestnut St, near the State House at the bottom of the map) and near Acorn Street, the "most photographed street in America".  The condo is vertically oriented, five stories high, and I stayed in a little room on the top floor.  It was a true Boston experience, and it was definitely a highlight of the trip.        It's funny how things work out.  The condo belongs to Steve Paige's Aunt and Uncle (I met Steve while riding through Maine).  Don and Louisa live in Boston with their kids Sarah, Sam, and Georgia, and their two standard poodles Jack and Zoe.  Thank you, Don and Louisa, for your generous hospitality.  It was great to meet you, and I can't imagine a better way to see Boston. 9/19 Woke up, grabbed a bagel, and walked the Freedom Trail.  The weather was gorgeous, the historical sites were fascinating, and the trail is a great way to see the city.   At the Bunker Hill visitor's center I saw some wonderful dioramas of the battle. Then I walked the 275 steps to the top of the memorial, for a wonderful view of the city. Another highlight of the visitor's center was that I got to use a waterless urinal for the first time. Yippee! After walking the trail, I took a ferry back to Long Wharf, and ate lunch at an Italian restaurant in Boston's North End.  In the evening I ate dinner with the Paige's, then walked the dogs with Louisa. 9/20  Another beautiful day.  At 10 am I took an interesting and informative hour-long tour of Harvard, led by a senior undergrad majoring in Government.  Then I found the offices of Dewey, Cheetham, and Howe and browsed the stacks at the Harvard Book Store.    After that, at 2 pm, I took a bland 1/2 hour tour of M.I.T., led by a senior undergrad majoring in Mechanical Engineering.  The highlight of the tour was the $2.25 falafel sandwich I had from a street vendor at M.I.T.  Soooo goooood ... In the evening, I joined the Paige's in seeing an outdoor production of the opera Carmen in the Boston Common.  Can you stand it? Song-of-the-Day in my Head:  Joy by Lucinda Williams.  I heard it in a store in Harvard Square, and it stuck.
Guy: "How's it going?", in a thick Boston accent Me: "Great." Guy: "Where you headed?" Me: "Key West." Guy: "No kidding." This is the funny part.  After taking a few seconds to let it digest, he shouts to me, as I'm already well past him: Guy: "Lucky Bastard!"    The Ride:  Rode from Boston to Acton in reverse of the way that I came in, along the Charles River.  From Acton I rode west and then southwest on a bunch of two-lane roads with names like Nashoba Rd, Sawyer Hill Rd, and Solomon Pond Rd through Littleton, Harvard, Bolton, South Berlin, and Northborough to Westborough.  I camped just southwest of I-90.    Song-in-my-Head of the Day:  a song from Carmen, the one with castanets.  I think it's the one that Carmen sings for Don Jose.
   While riding between Oxford and Dudley I passed just north of Lake Chargoggagoggmanchauggauggagoggchaubunagungamaugg (!).  Everyone!  Three times fast!   Chargoggagoggmanchauggauggagoggchaubunagungamaugg is an Indian word meaning "the boundary lake" and "You fish on your side, I fish on my side, nobody fishes in the middle." In Crystal Lake I went for a swim in, you guessed it, Crystal Lake.  The temperature was great, but the bottom was a bit murky, so I got the willies a couple times when my foot brushed up against some vegetation.  At least I hope it was vegetation. Song-in-my-Head of the Day:  Rusty Cage by Soundgarden
The hills of Connecticut are impressing me.  You have to have a sense of humor about the whole thing, otherwise you'll go mad.  Imagine riding up a 6% grade and rounding a corner thinking you'll see the descent, only to see more climbing.  D'oh!  The routes I've been riding in Connecticut are either up or down, not much level.  But I'll take hills over riding flat roads where you can see you're route stretch out in front of you for 20 miles anyday (think Midwest). The Ride:  Rode west from Crystal Lake on Rt 140 and a buncha two-lane roads to Windsor Locks, on the west side of the Connecticut River.  From there I took Rt 540 and then Rt 189 to Granby, where I turned west on Rt 20 and then Rt 219 through New Hartford to Rt 202.  Right on Rt 202 (west) to Torringford, where I turned south on Rt 183 and then south on Rt 4 to Harwinton.  Right on Rt 118, and then left on Rt 222 (south) to Thomaston, after passing under I-8.  From there I took Rt 6 to Watertown.    After the ride, at the grocery store in Watertown, I almost fell asleep standing in line at the registers.  Today's ride spanked me, 72 miles of hills.  The kid cashier was asking me about my backpack (a Gregory with a CamelBak 100 oz. bladder), and I had to really concentrate to stay awake and talk to him. Song-in-my-Head of the Day:  Chalkhills and Children by XTC.  That one's a mystery - don't know how it got in my head. Today was the first day of fall.  I've ridden in three seasons so far - yikes.
The Ride:  Rode west and then south from Watertown on Rt 6 through Minortown, North Woodbury, and Woodbury to Southbury, where I rode under I-84 and took a bunch of byootiful two-lane roads south to Rt 34, near Riverton.  From there I went west on Rt 34 for a bit to Stevenson, where I hopped on Rt 111 and rode south through East Village to Monroe.  After updating the website in Monroe, I took Rt 59 south through Upper Stepney and Easton to Fairfield.    Fairfield is where my cousin Chris lives with his wife Kristy, their kids Grant and Lauren, and their yellow lab Caymus.  My Aunt Kathy (Chris' mom) came over for dinner, and it was great to hang out with them for an evening. Song-in-my-Head of the Day:  (Listen to the) Flower People by Spinal Tap.  When I pulled in to a gas station in Minortown, I heard somebody say "listen" and then a pause before continuing.  During the pause I was waiting for him to continue "to what the flower people say".  I was obviously still tired from yesterday's ride.
After riding around the driveway with Grant for a few minutes, I took off at around 9:30 am.  I saw more roadkill than usual in the shoulder today.  Mostly squirrels, but also some raccoons and a couple of woodchucks. Today while eating dinner, I made the mistake of reading the ingredients in one of my favorite things to eat for dinner, and was horrified to learn that it contains "partially hydrogenated lard."  Yikes.  First one to guess the food (in the Guestbook), or the closest guess, wins a personalized journal entry for tomorrow's ride.  Good luck! The Ride:  Rode northwest from Fairfield on Rt 58 through Redding Ridge and Bethel to Danbury, where I continued on Rt 39 and entered New York.  After getting lost for a bit around Ball Pond, I surfaced at Haviland, and took Rt 22 north.  Just south of Pawling I turned left (west) on Rt 55 and rode that up and over a few ridges through West Pawling, Billings, Freedom Plains, and Arlington to Poughkeepsie (pron. puh-kip-sie, I still can't get it right).  I crossed the FDR Mid-Hudson bridge (a highlight of the day), and found camp just outside of Highland.    Song-in-my-Head of the Day:  Have You Ever Seen The Rain by CCR.  I heard it in a gas station in West Pawling after lunch, and it stuck.
The Ride:  Rode out of Highland and immediately got lost.  I wound up on a road called Pancake Batter Road, or something like that, and it spit me out at Clintondale.  OK, now I know where I am.  I rode west on Rt 44 / 55 through Ardonia, Modena, Ireland Corners, and Gardiner to Rt 7, where I turned left (SW) and rode through Shawangunk, Dwaarkill, Ulsterville and Burlingham.  Just before passing over I-17 I turned right and rode a 2-lane road that parallelled I-17 to Wurtsboro.  From there I turned SW and rode Rt 209 through Westbrookville, Cuddebackville, Godeftroy, Huguenot, Port Jarvis, crossed the NY - PA state line, rode to Milford PA, then crossed into NJ to Montague.  From there I rode the Old Mine Rd to Layton. It started raining before Port Jarvis, and didn't stop for the rest of the day, a very, very wet day.  I haven't ridden through rain like this yet.  Up until now, it's been spotty - more showers than steady rain.  This is steady.  I hid in the Port Jarvis library for a while, and the Doppler Radar looked almost comical.  It was just one big blob of green, indicating rain.    Song-in-my-Head of the Day:  The Spark That Bled by The Flaming Lips
   The Ride:  Rode sw from Layton on Rt 615 through the Delaware Water Gap National Recreation Area, a beautiful ride, through Walpack Center and Millbrook Village to Delaware Water Gap, after crossing the Delaware River into PA.  I then rode Rt 611 south through Portland, Mount Bethel, and Martins Creek to Easton, where I crossed back into NJ, ate lunch at a small but not-so-quaint market in Phillipsburg, and continued south on the River Rd through Carpentersville and, via Rt 627 and a detour on Church Rd, Milford.    Today was not what I would call a great day for a bike ride.  It started rainy, the rain tapered off by 11 am but the humidity and warm mugginess stayed around.  Oh, and I had three flat tires.  The last flat I had before today was a month ago, sometime well before Syracuse, NY.  Pennsylvania?  I say Glassylvania. Flat #1:  Near Millbrook Village, I heard a strange sound coming from The Pig.  The tire had gone flat, the first time in the entire Tour.  I took the tube out, inflated it, and couldn't hear a leak.  I searched the tire for any sharp pointy objects and, after finding none, put a new tube in and continued on. Flat #2:  Between Martins Creek and Easton, the rear tire went flat in a hurry.  Took the tube out, inflated it, found the leak, patched it, took out the glass that was in the tire, and continued on.  Ugh. Flat #3:  Just outside of Milford, I heard that dreaded wubba coming from The Pig, and decided that I had fixed enough flats for the day.  I found the first suitable campsite (behind a deserted barn), and made camp.  Going to sleep with a flat tire was a bit like going to sleep with dirty dishes to wash, but I didn't care.  I was sick of fixing flats for the day. In Delaware Water Gap I crossed the Appalachian Trail.  Pretty cool.
In the calm and clarity of the morning light, I found a piece of glass wedged in one of The Pig's tire's treads, so I took it out, patched the tube, and headed down the road confident that it wouldn't go flat for at least 30 minutes. The Ride:  Rode to Milford via Church Rd and Rt 519 (the detour), continued south to Frenchtown, then picked up a great crushed stone bike path that parallels the Delaware River through Byram and Stockton to Lambertville.  From there I headed east on Rt 518 through Woodsville, Hopewell, and Blawenburg to Rt 206, which I took south into Princeton.    The wind today was swirly and gusty, probably to do with Isidore.  A beautiful day for a bike ride, though. In Princeton I'm staying with my friends Sam and Cate Blanchard, their kids Bjorn and Ursula, their great dane Cosmo, and their cats Zeke and George.  I used to work with Sam in Portland, Oregon before we both moved on to greener pastures. Song-in-my-Head of the Day:  Undone - The Sweater Song by Weezer.
Today was a short day, which was nice.  I've got 90 miles to go to Chadds Ford, PA, my next stop, which is too much for one day but a nice lazy two days. The Ride:  Rode from Princeton to Lambertsville the same way that I came in, although I took Rt 601 from Princeton to Rt 518 instead of Rt 206.  At Lambertville I crossed the Delaware River into PA, passed through New Hope, and headed SW on Lower Mountain Rd.    I've said it before, and I'll say it again.  It's funny how things work out.  It's about 4:30 pm, I'm riding along Lower Mountain Road, and I see this Subaru Outback pull into a driveway up ahead.  When I reach the driveway, there's a guy standing there, and he asks me if I'm on a bike tour.  We get to talking, and he offers me a place to stay for the night, at his place.  Ken and his wife Barb have toured by bike before, and tonight I'm staying in their guest bedroom.  How 'bout that?  Thanks, Ken and Barb!
   Rt 30 and Rt 100 were, for the most part, obnoxiously busy.  I veered from the ACA route to get to Chadds Ford, and experienced suburban Philly traffic in all of its glory.  Yikes. Chadds Ford is where my friend John's architecural office is located.  He and I worked on a project in 1998 when I was living in Portland, and we've loosely been keeping in touch since then.  I threw the rig in his car, and we drove the rest of the way (seven miles, not much of a cheat) to Kennett Square.  John and Laura, his wife, are in the process of remodeling a huge old barn into a 8,000 sq.ft. home.  It's a huge project, and should be done in the next twenty years or so.  We went out to eat at a great mexican restaurant where the waitress kept asking us "Do you need anything?" instead of, say, "Is everything ok?" or "How is everything?"   
The Ride:  Rode west from Kennett Square on Old Baltimore Pike, which parallels Rt 1, through Avondale, Jennersville, and Oxford to Nottingham, where I turned northwest onto Rt 272 through Little Britain and Wakefield.  At Chestnut Leve I turned west off of Rt 272 on to River Rd, and took that to Rt 372.  I took Rt 372 across the Susquehanna River, turned left (south) on Rt 74, which turned into Rt 165 when I reached Maryland, and rode that through Whiteford, Pylesville, and Federal Hill to Jarrettsville.    It was a good route, with a big wide shoulder, but not the most peaceful.  Except for River Rd, I saw a lot of dump trucks, more than usual. Song-in-my-Head of the Day:  Amado Mio by  Pink Martini
The Ride:  Rode south from Jarrettsville on Rt 146 through Hess to Manor Rd, where I continued south through Sweet Air and then turned sw on Dulaney Valley Rd.  I skirted around the south side of Loch Raven Reservoir (best said with a Scottish accent) on Loch Raven Rd, Providence Rd, Seminary Ave, and Bellona Ave to Rt 139.  At Rt 139 I turned south and headed into Baltimore via Rt 139, Lake Ave, Roland Ave, University Pkwy (went right by Johns Hopkins University), and St. Paul St.  Before splashing into Chesapeake Bay, I turned west to Ellicott City via Rt 144 (Lombard St and Frederick Ave).  I stayed on Rt 144 to West Friendship, where I turned south on Rt 32.  In Glenelg I hopped on Ten Oaks Rd, rode that through Dayton, turned right on Highland Rd, turned right on Brighton Dam Rd, turned left on Rt 650, turned right on Rt 108, then turned right on Dominion Dr.    In Sandy Spring I'm staying with Anne and Joe Connor, parents of my friend Steve in SLC.  Anne made a big pasta dinner and a great apple pie, which hit the spot.  After that, we walked around and found glowworms.  Ever seen fireflies?  Same thing, except worms.  I did a load of wash and hung the clothes outside to dry, which was kinda stupid since it was 4,000% humidity.  They were sopping wet the next morning.   
   The Ride:  Rode west on Rt 108 to Baltimore Pike Rd (I think), where I turned north and then west on Gold Mill Rd (I think) to Rt 97, where in Brookeville I turned north and then a quick left on Brookville Rd.  Between there and D.C., I took Rt 108, Muncaster Rd, Rt 115, Shady Grove Rd (busy - that's where I crossed I-270 at the tail end of morning rush hour), Darnestown Rd, Glen Mill Rd, South Glen Rd, Democracy Blvd, Newbridge Rd, Kentsdale Dr, Bradley Rd (Rt 191), Broad Branch Rd, and, finally, the Rock Creek Bike Path.    While riding by the Chevy Chase Country Club, I couldn't help but think of Irwin M. Fletcher, the Underhills, and Mr. & Mrs. & Mrs. Alan Stanwyk. In D.C. I met up with a good friend from SLC, Mel, and we hung out for the evening.  She was in D.C., specifically Dupont Circle, for work - funny how things work out.  We had a few beers at a bar with the largest beer selection I've ever seen (she sampled Norwegian and Greek beers, I had a couple English ales), went to eat at a Malaysian restaurant with her cousin, and then I crashed on her swank hotel room floor.  It was nice to escape the high humidity for an evening.
Friday 10/04 I took guided tours of the Library of Congress and the Supreme Court.  Then I spent a couple hours wandering around the National Gallery of Art.  The East Wing, designed by I.M. Pei, is amazing - I enjoyed the building as much as the collections.  I then went to the International Syp Museum, but balked at the $11 admission (all the others were free).  At 7 pm I went back to the Library of Congress to watch a 1950 movie called I Want To Live! for free. After I got back to the hostel, I stayed up for a bit talking to people from all over the world - from Germany, Portland (Oregon), the Czech Republic, St. Louis, etc.  Most of the people staying there speak English, and some of them have gooder English than me.  Hostels are great - most everyone is open, and interested to hear where you're from, where you've been, where you're going, etc. Saturday 10/05 First I went to the National Air & Space museum with a guy named Burke who's also staying at the hostel.  After oohing and aahing at some of the stuff they have, we split up, and I spent a buncha time at the National Museum of American History and then a quick visit to the National Building Museum.  Not much stuff at National Building Museum, but it's a beautiful building, especially the interior.  After that, I visited the National Museum of Natural History until they kicked us out at 5:30 pm.  I hung out for a bit at a bookstore, reading this and that, then went back to the hostel, cooked dinner, and played cards for a couple of hours with five other people staying there.  It was a great time. I stayed in a 8-person dorm in the hostel, and most of the people in the room weren't the same as those last night.  After saying goodnight in our respective languages (Slovak, Hebrew, Danish, Japanese, and English), I went to sleep fast after a long day of walkin' around.  Enough of this walking, I'm looking forward to getting back on the bike.
The Ride:  Rode back through Rock Creek Park, crossed the Potomac River via the Arlington Memorial Bridge after seeing the monuments, then rode the Mt. Vernon Bike Path all the way down to, you guessed it, Mt. Vernon, the historic home of George Washington.  From there I rode Rt 235 and Rt 1 to Lorton, then Rt 600 west, Rt 123 northwest, and Rt 645 northwest through Clifton to Centreville.    In Centreville I'm spending the night with my cousin Tom Carmody, his wife Rebecca, their kids Molly, Ethan, and Sydney, and their jack russell terrier Mattie.  I haven't seen Tom and Rebecca in over ten years, I think we figured out, so it's great to see and visit with them outside of a big crazy family setting.  I got there at about 4 pm, Tom and I visited Manassas National Battlefield Park, where the first battle of the Civil War took place.  Then we ate dinner and talked about all sorts of stuff for the rest of the night.
The Ride:  After eating a big breakfast at the Carmodys, including a bowl of Molly's favorite cereal, I rode south from Centreville on Rt 28, a four-lane divided highway with a shoulder that looks like a gravel and glass dumping ground, through Manassas to Rt 619, which I took southeast to Rt 611.  My mood instantly improved when I turned south on Rt 611, as it's a deserted two-lane road meandering through farmland.  I hooked back up with the ACA route and took Rts 611, 612, 646, 616, 627, 651, 628, 626, and 607 to Fredericksburg.  In Fredericksburg I rode through the Fredericksburg Spotsylvania National Military Park (where Confederate Commander R.E. Lee said, "It is well that war is so terrible - we should grow too fond of it!") on Rts 638 and 636, then camped off a dirt road off Rt 608 (just before reaching Rt 17 Byp). Rt 28 was a fast road, but not a great road for bicycling.  Every now and then I'd see a separate paved bike path alongside the road.  So, I'd take it, only to have it dead end in less than a quarter mile.  It was kinda frustrating, so I just held my breath and stayed on Rt 28. Note to self:  When camping within 100 yards of train tracks, hang out for 15 minutes or so to see if there's much train traffic.  After I set up the tent, the train traffic picked up, both passenger and freight.  D'oh!    Song-in-my-Head of the Day:  End Of The Line by Concrete Blonde
The Ride:  Rode south from Fredericksburg on Rts 608, 633, and 607 to Guinea.  From there I went southwest on Rts 606 and 632 to Cedon, which is right near Rt 1.  Then I made my way south, parallel to Rt 1, on Rts 661, 603, 684, 685, 738, and 667 to Ashland.  After picking up some stuff at the Post Office, I continued south on Rts 626 and 623 to Richmond, where I snaked my way through town on Rts 161 and then southeast on Rt 60 and Darbytown to camp, just before passing under I-295.    As I was walking the bike out of camp, I noticed the rear tire was dead flat.  D'oh!  Not the best way to start the ride.  So, I patched the tube, removed the piece of metal from the tire, and found a piece of wire that was also lodged in the tire, at a different location, but hadn't punctured the tube yet.  They may have been remnants of yesterday's ride in the 'burbs. The highlight of the day was the package of goodness waiting for me at the Ashland post office.  My mom sent me a buncha homemade cookies, and a couple of books (store-bought, not homemade books).  I ate most of the cookies standing in the post office lobby, and was glad that I had another 30 miles to ride as I needed to work some of those cookies off. Just outside of Cedon I passed a field with about ten vultures circling low, at about tree level, above a family graveyard (only about four headstones).  It was about the eeriest thing I've ever seen.
The Ride:  Rode southwest from Richmond on Darbytown Road, left the ACA route and hooked up with Rt 5, and rode that for 42 miles through Charles City to Williamsburg.  From there I rode south to oh-so-historic Jamestown (where the first representative assembly in the New World convened in 1619), took the free ferry across the James River to Scotland, and rode Rt 31 to Dendron.  I rode southeast from Dendron for a bit, back on the ACA route, and camped in the woods across from a cotton field. I took Route 5 instead of the ACA route, based on Mr. Rosecrans' suggestion, and it turned out to be a great road.  The surface was great, most of it was under a canopy of trees, and even though it didn't have any shoulder to speak of, the traffic was very light.  Also, it went right by a buncha old plantations, most built in the early 1700s.    After buying lunch and dinner at the not-so-quaint mega-huge grocery store in Williamsburg, located in the Ye Olde Towne Shoppinge Centere, or something like that, I rode around for a bit, looking at a buncha old buildings. Song-in-my-Head of the Day:  Gypsy Road by Cinderella.  Yes, THAT Cinderella, the 80's hair metal band.  I saw a road called Gypsy Road, and that was all it took.  I can still picture the lead singer, king of the hair farmers, flapping his lips in the video about how his gypsy road can't take him home.  Aaaaaaaaaugh!  Make it stop! I can't remember the last time I've seen a cotton field.  After dinner I went over and picked a piece of cotton, and was surprised how easy it came out of its "shell".  I didn't loiter for too long, though, for fear the hound dogs would start barking.  I've entered the land of hound dogs, and I like to hear them howl at me when I ride past.    At camp, the mosquitoes were out in full force.  Instead of seeking shelter in the tent, I tried to light a couple of Nag Champa incense sticks since the air was still, but no go.  There's hardly any incense left on the sticks - it's rubbed off after being jostled around in the handlebar bag since Port Townsend, Washington.  Oh well, the tent it is.
The Ride:  Rode southeast from Dendron on a buncha quiet roads (I'm not even gonna name 'em - who cares?) through Central, Isle of Wight, Suffolk, crossed into North Cackalackee, rode through Holly Grove, then picked up Rt 158 for the rest of the way into Elizabeth City.    For the first 40 miles, with no headwind and the roads flat as a pancake (mmm ... pancake), I averaged 14.6 mph.  But, at 11 am, the winds picked up, and the average for the day dropped to 13.5 mph. Good thing I had a NC state map with me - Elizabeth City is just off the ACA maps, and is a big town with a grocery store.  If I would've stayed on the ACA maps, I'm sure it would've been Chili without Beans from some podunk store for dinner. Camped in a swamp - I didn't have much of a choice.  After all, I'm riding through the Great Dismal Swamp - how's that for an oxymoron?  Got to camp at 6 pm, and it was already dark.  By 6:45, after everything was set for the night and I sat down to dinner (rigatoni with spag sauce and parmesan cheese, the real cheese not the junk from the green container), it was officially dark.  And humid.  And lots of mosquitoes.

It's kinda amusing, in a scary sort of way.  See where it says "HSE" in the lower right hand corner?  Yeah, that's me.  It stands for Hatteras sumthin' or other.

The Ride:  Rode east from Elizabeth City on Rt 158 to Barco, where I turned south and rode through Coinjock, Aydlett, Poplar Branch, Grandy, Jarvisburg, Harbinger, Point Harbor, and Kitty Hawk to Kill Devil Hills.   
   For the first 60 miles today, from Kill Devil Hills to Buxton, I averaged 18.8 mph, which is just plain flying (usually I average 14 mph if it's flat and there's no wind).  At Buxton I turned west, so my average for the day was reduced to 16.4 mph, which is still the fastest average of the Tour to date. The Ride:  Rode south from Kill Devil Hills on Rt 12 through Nags Head, Rodanthe, Waves, Salvo, Avon, Buxton, and Frisco to Hatteras, where I took a 40 min. ferry to Ocracoke Island.    The hostel was great, as usual.  When I got there yesterday afternoon, it was just another guy and I.  Then a group of kayakers rolled in that got blown off the water due to the storm.  Later I met Sara and Virginia, who live in Wilmington.  They offered their place for me to stay at (Wilmington is a couple days down the road), so I've got that going for me.  The whole group hung out on the porch watching the rain come down in buckets.  I was glad to be there, not just for the roof over my head, but also for the company. In Waves I watched a kite boarding competition.  Think giant kites and snowboards - it was insane.  These guys could fly twenty feet in the air, doing flips and twists, and sometimes land on the water with the board, sometimes not, which made for some spectacular crashes.  It was absolutely crazy. In Ocracoke I went to Howard's Pub and had a crab cake sandwich that was so good I could barely stand it.  I also had a beer from a North Carolina brewery (Highland St. Terese's Pale Ale), which was not so good. Song-in-my-Head of the Day:  Testify by Rage Against The Machine
The Ride:  After taking the ferry from Ocracoke to Cedar Island, I rode southwest from Cedar Island on Rt 12 to Rt 70, then continued through Stacy, Williston, Otway, Bettie, and Beaufort to Morehead City.  From there I took Rt 24 through Bogue, Cape Carteret, and Cedar Point to Swansboro.    Last night the mosquitoes were ruthless.  I set up camp in record time, since I couldn't stand still for more than a second without them swarming over me.  During the night, they were hanging out on the inside of the tent fly, which was creepy.  There were literally hundreds of them - it was like the movie The Birds. The ferry ride was great.  The weather was nice, and we were way out there, couldn't see any land for a stretch.  I started riding at noon, and had a great tailwind that pushed me right down the road.  Right after I set up camp and made dinner, it started raining.  Good timing, but with the tent fly sealing in the heat and humidity (I had a pot of pesto pasta that was making things a bit warm in the tent), I had my own sweat lodge for a while.  I thought my days of eating dinner in my skivvies were over, but guess not.
The Ride:  Rode west from Swansboro on Rt 24 to Hubert, where I turned south on Rt 172 and entered Camp Lejeune Marine Corps Base.  I rode through Camp Lejeune for 20 miles and was hoping to see tanks and troops crossing the road, doing training exercises, but as it was only 9 am, they were probably still all asleep, lazy bums.  Just south of the New River, near Sneads Ferry, I turned south on Rt 210 and rode that right along the Atlantic Ocean to Surf City, where the road turned inland to Hampstead.  From there I rode Rts 210, 1002 and 1318 to Wilmington.      I got to Virginia and Sara's place at around 3 pm.  I met them at the hostel in Kitty Hawk a couple days ago, and they're students at the University of North Carolina.  First thing I did at their place was start a load of wash.  After the washing machine blew up, probably due to the stink of the clothes involved, we finished the job later that evening at a laundromat / bar in downtown Wilmington, which turned out to be a great place to hang out for an hour or so.

   The Ride:  Rode south on River Rd from Wilmington through Carolina Beach and Kure Beach to Fort Fisher, where I took a 30 min. ferry to Southport.  After stuffing my face with cookies in Southport, I rode west on Rt 211 to Supply, then southwest on Rt 17 through Shallotte to Rt 57, where I entered South Carolina.    Shallotte, of course, is home of Independent Championship Wrestling.  Thankfully, I didn't see any of the wrestlers walking the streets. Song-in-my-Head of the Day:  The Silver Hawaiian by Helmet
   Good deed of the day:  I saved a turtle from almost certain death.  It was crossing the road, and very slowly at that since it was a turtle and all.  I picked it up from the center of the road, and put it in the weeds on the side of the road.  Of course, it probably walked back onto the road and got crushed by a truck as I was riding down the road feeling like a good samaritan, but hey, it doesn't hurt to try. The Ride:  Rode southwest from Brooksville just to the south of Big Swamp on Rt 57.  At Wampee I contined on Rt 90, turned northwest on Rt 31 for a bit, then took Rt 905 west into Conway.  From there, I rode Rt 701 south through Bucksport, over the Great Pee Dee River to Yauhannah, where I turned west onto Rt 261 and then Rt 513 to Pleasant Hill.  From there, I continued southwest on Rt 513 and then Rt 41 into Andrews.    After visiting the grocery store and the library in Andrews, I set out to find a place to camp along Rt 41, which is the dividing line between the Boggy Swamp (yes!  I love these names!) and the Johnson Swamp.  In other words, I had a tough time finding a spot.  I pulled off onto a dirt road that looked promising, only to run into a hunter with no teeth that was just getting out of his pickup to go shoot some more deer.  Uh, ok, I think I'll go down Rt 41 a ways.  I eventually found a spot that wasn't saturated with water from the rains that Kyle dished out, but the mosquitoes were out in full force.  I slopped on some Natrapel, and they didn't bother me no more.  The stuff works, and it doesn't give me that skin-searing feeling like DEET does. Andrews is the hometown of Chubby Checker, so they've got that going for them.
The Ride:  Rode southwest from Andrews on Rt 41 through Jamestown, then a buncha quiet two-lane roads that wound their way through a path of destruction left behind by 1989's Hurricane Hugo, on Rts 48, 125, and 171 through Bethra and Witherbee to Rt 402, which I took to Rt 17A and Moncks Corner.  From there I took more quiet roads west-southwest through Ridgeville to Walterboro.    In Walterboro I found a great campsite among the pines, right near the intersection of Rts 17A and 63 and right before entering the Great Swamp. Song-in-my-Head for the first half of the Day:  But Anyway by Blues Traveler Song-in-my-Head for the second half of the Day:  Burn One Down by Ben Harper   
The Ride:  Rode south from Walterboro on Rt 17A through Hendersonville and Yemasse to Pocotaligo, where I peeled off the ACA route (for the rest of the Tour) and hopped on a frontage road that parallels I-95.  I rode that through Ridgeland and Switzerland (!) to Hardeeville, where I ate a yogurt-banana lunch and continued south on Rt 17.  Upon close inspection of the map, I saw that Rt 17 turns into a restricted interstate right before Savannah, so I turned west on Rt 170 into Port Wentworth, Georgia, then took Rt 25 the rest of the way into Savannah. Right when I crossed the Savannah River into Georgia, the first thing I saw were palm trees.  I didn't see any in South Carolina. I got to the hostel in Savannah at 2 pm, only to find out that they don't open until 5 pm.  OK, so I rode around Savannah for a few hours, and it was great.  I stayed in the historic district, and rode by all of the squares (the hostel is located a couple blocks away from Monterey Square).  The historic district is a mess of restored houses, old churches, monuments, cobblestone streets, shady sidewalks, and the lush green squares.      I went back to the hostel at 5 pm, showered (aaah), made dinner, watched a bit of the first game of the world series, then went to bed.  I was wiped after today's ride.  The first 75 miles were getting from Walterboro to Savannah, and the rest were spent tooling around town.  The hostel is an odd one - it's a very sterile environment, no books to read, no art on the walls, and not many people staying there, which surprised me since it's the weekend at all.  The best part was that I had the whole dorm to myself, so I could switch beds every now and then if I wanted, but I didn't.   
The Ride (this is an easy one):  Rode south on Rt 17 from Savannah through Richmond Hill, Midway, Riceboro, and Retreat to South Newport.    Mosquitoes rule my world.  They were out in droves at camp, so once again it was a mad dash to set up the tent and get inside.  I escaped relatively unscathed, but these mosquitoes seem to be particularly ruthless.  Another observation:  the roadkill in Georgia smells worse than in any other state, possibly because the humidity is still hovering at around 5,000%.
The hostel consists of a few big wood domes (one common room / kitchen, one staff quarters, and the other a big, huge library) and a bunch of tree houses and huts to sleep in.  I arrive at about 2 pm, showered, then checked myself into the Dragon's Lair, a hut located near the pond.  Lots of ducks, lots of frogs, no mosquitoes in the hut, it was great.      A big banana spider whose web canopied the path between the main huts and the Dragon's Lair added to the swampy feeling.  The thing was huge, and it's back looks like a skull, which is a bit creepy.  I was ok as long as I walked quickly under it. As far as Mother Nature vs. the Sweat Lodge, Mother Nature won, big time.  As tonight was a full moon, the hostel was doing a sweat lodge, which consists of sitting in a hot room (naked, unless you like to be drenched in sweaty clothes) and meditating, chanting, etc.  The hippies - er, employees of the hostel spent the whole day getting the sweat lodge ready by tending the fire.  I didn't see the sweat lodge as it's located down a swampy path that was currently under 12" of water, and I figured if I were to make the trip, it would be once.  Well, at 5:30 pm, there was a crash boom bam kerrang thunder lightning rainstorm that quenched the fire and put the kibosh on the sweat lodge.  Oh well. The Ride:  Rode south from South Newport on Rt 17 through Eulonia and Darien to Rt 303, which I took around Brunswick to Rt 82. At 8 pm we ate a big communal dinner of pasta and a great couscous-sweet potato-squash dish.  There were about 25 of us, and it was fun to eat dinner in the screened-in dining room with everyone else.
Today's ride was, well, boring.  Rt 82 is a four-lane divided highway with light traffic, no hills, and hardly any curves.  After Waycross things got a bit more scenic, but not much. While riding along Rt 82, I rode by a semi that was stopped in the right hand lane because two of its wheels had fallen off, no lie.  They were the left rear wheels of the truck (not the trailer), and it looked like the axle shaft had broken.  The driver was standing in the road scratching his head, which was understandable. The Ride:  Rode west on Rt 82 through Waynesville, Atkinson, Lulaton, Nahunta, and Hoboken to Waycross, where I continued west on Rt 122 to Cogdell.    I'm surprised that I made it as far as I did today, considering I didn't leave the hostel until 10:30 am.  I was going to stay a bit longer, but the combined smell of patchouli and sawdust was getting to me. Song-in-my-Head of the Day:  Deeper Shade of Soul by Urban Dance Squad (don't know where that came from, but it stuck)

The Ride:  Continued west from Cogdell on Rt 122, also known as the William Jackson "Moogie" Lee Highway through Lakeland to Hahira, where I took an unnamed quiet road to Morven.  From there I went south on Rt 76 to Quitman.    While riding through Lakeland, I saw signs along the road that said:  Re-Elect Peg Blitch State Senate.  Talk about an unfortunate surname. Today was all about animals.  First I saw about fifteen vultures sitting close together in trees right alongside the road.  It was eerie, of course, and it was also a message to me that there was a dead animal close by, so I held my breath and kept riding. Then, a bit later, I heard a noise coming from the forest to the left of me.  I looked over, and saw a piglet pop out of the forest with another piglet in hot pursuit.  They ran alongside the forest for about ten feet, then ran back in the forest.  It was the cutest thing I've seen on the Tour so far, cuter than the bunny playing with the squirrel in Stromsburg.  I mean, come on, a wee little piglet chasing another wee little piglet?  Ah, I could barely stand it. On the road between Hahira and Morven I saw a black dog standing in the middle of the road.  As I approached him (or her, or it, but I'll stick with him), he moved to the side of the road.  When I got real close, he ran towards me with the rips, legs flailing, then ran alongside me in the grassy ditch for about a mile.  I was impressed that he could keep up (I was going about 15 mph).    On that same road, after the dog had given up and walked back home (presumably), I saw about ten brown cows with long, floppy ears.  It was a bit confusing - they had the body of a cow, but the head of a dachsund. Song-in-my-Head of the Day:  Skinned by Blind Melon   
The Ride:  Rode southwest on Grooverville Rd from Quitman into Florida, then south on Rt 149 to Monticello.  From there I rode Rt 90 west into Tallahassee, got lost for a bit in the crazy busy outskirts of Tallahassee, then eventually found my way to my Aunt Ann and Uncle Wayne's place. Between Quitman and Monticello there was hardly any traffic at all.  It was a beautiful ride.    In Tallahassee I'm hanging out with a buncha family for a while.  Then I plan on getting back on the bike on Monday, 10/28/02, for the final push to Key West.
On Friday Aunt Rita and I went to Wakulla Springs, one of the world's largest and deepest freshwater springs, and where a certain famous movie was filmed.  We took a boat tour and saw a bunch of birds, some jumping fish, and a few big lazy alligators sitting in the water.  We then ate an interesting seafood lunch, then went out to see the St. Marks lighthouse.  That evening we went back to Tallahassee and went downtown with Laurie and Aunt Ann to a city party for the next day's big game.    Saturday Aunt Ann, Aunt Rita, Wayne's cousin Jerry and I went to the Florida State - Notre Dame football game.  Talk about a major game - they've never played before in Tallahassee, and they're both good teams.  To say that Florida State football is popular in Tallahassee is an understatement, so for this big rivalry the fans were excited.  It was a good game for the first half (it was 10-10 at the half), but then Florida State fell apart the rest of the game and lost 34-24.  Oh well (easy for me to say - I'm not from Tallahassee). Sunday I went to see Holly and Doug's place with Aunt Ann, Holly, 1 yr old Sarah, and my new best friend 3 yr old Hanna.  She was so cute - she would not leave my side.  We all went to Aunt Rita's place for dinner on Sunday night.
   The Ride:  Rode south from Tallahassee on a bike trail that parallels Rt 363 through Woodville to Rt 267 (Wakulla), which I took southeast to Rt 98 (Newport), which I took east through Hampton Springs to Perry.    Right outside of Tallahassee my rear tire developed a slow leak, probably due to a sharp pointy thing that I rode over sometime in Tallahassee.  As I was fixing the flat, under shelter, it rained, so it was good timing. Just before reaching Wakulla a couple other riders joined up with me, and we rode together to Newport.  I wish I had someone else to ride with - the miles flew by as we were riding together and talking.  Along the way we saw a dead coral snake in the road's shoulder. I'm surprised at the number of dead armadillos that I've seen - not that so many have been hit by traffic, but that there are any armadillos at all in Florida.  I always pictured them as more of desert creatures, but today I probably saw fifteen on them.
The Ride:  Rode east from Perry on Rt 27 through Fenholloway, Mayo, Alton, Branford, Hildreth, and Fort White to High Springs.  From there I rode Rt 441 to Alachua.    Just before Branford I saw a wild pig running in a field by the side of the road, and about a half mile later I crossed the Suwannee River.  This is significant because during a family vacation when I was a kid, we stopped at a picnic area along the Suwannee River for lunch and saw a dead pig floating in the river.  We didn't stay to eat, it was just a bit too eerie. In Branford I stopped for lunch, and hung out in the air-conditioned library for a bit, where I learned that it was 82 deg. F and 70% relative humidity outside.  That's sticky.  I'm looking forward to getting back to the dry mountain climate. Today was a difficult ride, both mentally and physically.  Mentally because the roads were generally flat and straight with not much change in scenery, physically because I had a punishing headwind the whole day. Tonight I'm staying with someone from the Warm Showers list.  The Warm Showers List is a list of Internet cyclists who have offered their hospitality towards touring cyclists. The extent of the hospitality depends on the host and may range from simply a spot to pitch a tent to meals, a warm (hot!) shower, and a bed.  To get the list, you need to put your name on the list, simple as that.  It's a great idea, and if you're a touring cyclist, click here to learn more.  I wish I knew about it sooner in the trip, I may have been able to shower more often.  I don't shower much. Song-in-my-Head of the Day:  Little Lord Fontleroy by Quasi
The Ride: Rode south from Alachua on Rt 235 to Newberry, where I continued south on Rt 337 through Bronson to Tidewater.  From there I rode Rt 336 and Rt 40 east to Dunnellon.  Then I took Rt 41 south until I saw a paved rail trail alongside the road.  I got off the busy Rt 41 and hopped on this trail (the Withlacoochee trail) for the rest of the way to Inverness.    Rt 235 was a rainy busy mess complete with dump trucks, but Rt 337 was everything a quiet two-lane road through the country should be. Today was another hot one, a high of maybe 85 and not much cloud cover.  I can't understand how people can live with this hot sticky weather.  It's almost November and it's still hot!  Sure, air conditioning makes it possible, but does that make sense?  That's a lot of energy being used just to make life tolerable. Bodily function discovery: Pringles make me poop.  Now, this is not at all a bad thing.  Say things didn't move as much as I was hoping they would in the morning.  Well, for lunch I can eat one of those little cans of Pringles (usually $0.59), wait about fifteen minutes, then head back into the grocery store with a determined look on my face.
The Ride:  Continued south from Inverness on the Withlacoochee rail trail through Floral City, Pineola, and Ridge Manor to somewhere near Trilby, where the trail spit me out on Rt 301.  I rode Rt 301 through Dade City and Clinton Heights to Zephyrhills, where I turned south onto Rt 39.  I rode Rt 39 through Crystal Springs, Knights, and Plant City to Keysville, where I took a road that looked good but ended up getting me pretty lost.  It was a great road, really, no traffic, windy, scenic, but I had no idea where I was.  It finally spit me out on Rt 39, and I rode that south through Picnic to Fort Lonesome.    Early in the ride, along the rail trail, I saw a big doe (I say, D'oh!) standing in the trail way up ahead of me.  When I got closer, a baby deer came out from the woods onto the trail, and momma and baby went walking into the woods on the other side of the trail.  That baby was really cute, all legs.  If you've ever been in Florida, you know that Florida has the worst drivers in the U.S.  Every car ride I took in Tallahassee was a stress fest, and the bike rides I've done since then have been a test of my defensive riding skills.  Drivers in Florida don't use their turn signals much, and they also like to turn right in front of cyclists.  I think they assume that all cyclists are going 5 mph, and wouldn't mind stopping to let a car turn in front of them.  Yikes. Song-in-my-Head of the Day: It started with Friends in Low Places by Garth Brooks, dunno how it got there, but thank got it left.  After a few other songs surfaced and retreated, Galaxie by Blind Melon was with me for a couple of hours.
The Ride:  Rode south from Fort Lonesome on Rt 39 to Rt 62, which I took east through Duette.  At Fort Green Springs, I turned south on Rt 663 to Vandolah, where the road turned to dirt.  Well, dirt is a strong word - it was more of a sand road.  For the three miles I was on this sand road, it was about half hardpack (rideable), half 6" deep sand (not rideable with skinny tires and a 50 lb. trailer).  At Ona it turned back to a paved surface, and I rode that south  to Limestone, where the road turned into Rt 661.  At Rt 70 I turned east to Arcadia, then continued south on Rt 31 through Babcock to Rt 80.  I turned east on Rt 80 for a bit, then turned south onto Buckingham Road to Lehigh Acres.  Phew!  That's a ride.    Along Rt 31, just south of Babcock, I saw a bunch of stuff up ahead in the shoulder.  From a distance I couldn't figure out what it was, but as I rode into the traffic lane to avoid it, I saw that it was a dead alligator.  Now that's roadkill!  It was probably five feet long, lots of teeth and claws, and it was certainly dead.  After that, since I was riding through swampy areas, I kept looking for more alligators, but didn't see any.  Oh well.  I may see more as I get deep into the Big Cypress Swamp tomorrow. I think tonight may be the last night of the Tour for poaching a campsite, and I found a great one, the pinnacle of the poach.  It was off the road about 1/4 of a mile, very secluded, and it was in a grove of pine and palm trees.  It looked like a movie set (that nice!).  The floor consisted only of pine needles.  No spiders, only a few mosquitoes, and a nice breeze.  It was great.  The breeze reminded me of Key West when I visited a couple of years ago, which seems appropriate because I'm pretty close to Key West.   
   Somewhere along Rt 29 I saw a dead piglet in the shoulder.  It was kinda sad 'cause it was kinda cute. At Sunniland I entered the Big Cypress Swamp and was immediately told to watch out for panthers crossing the road for the next seven miles.  Panthers!?!  Then another sign said that there are no more than 30 left in the swamp.  That eased my fears a bit.  This part of Florida is what I've been looking forward to - the Everglades / Big Cypress part.  It's chock full of wildlife.  There are lots of birds with long beaks, long necks, and big wingspans flying around everywhere.  The few vultures that are here look out of place with their little beaks and little necks.  I saw a little alligator swimming in the canal alongside Rt 29 (it was about 24" long), as well as a bunch of fish slurping stuff off the surface.  Lots of big turtles as well. Just east of Carnestown I officially entered the Big Cypress National Preserve and, since the auto traffic picked up, I saw less wildlife.  Damn cars.  The landscape is crazy - lots of grasses, and the land slopes at only 2" per mile to the south (Florida Bay and the Gulf of Mexico).  Add 60" of rain per year, and that makes for some wet land.  The National Park brochure is hysterical.  Here's some highlights: "Hikers should be prepared for wet areas from ankle- to waist- deep in the rainy season and early in the dry season." "Alligators and venomous snakes (including water moccasins) are found almost everywhere in the preserve.  Watch where you walk, sit, or reach." Today I lucked out.  I made a beeline for the visitor's center just east of Monroe Station to fill up my water bottles and CamelBak and ask about camping.  I got there at 4:22, eight minutes before they closed, and filled my stuff up.  I asked about the campground a mile away.  They said it's closed and the nearest one is five miles back the way I just came from, but I put on my tired face (that wasn't too tough, since I was very tired) and asked if I could camp at the closed campground anyway.  They said ok, and I was happy (and lucky). Camp was good.  A beautiful swampy sunset, and there was a pond there, so I washed up using pond water that I hauled from the pond to camp as a good leave-no-trace'r.  The passing motorists were honking at me as I was washing up, butt naked of course (I was camped about 100 yards off the road).  It was another hot day, high in the mid- to upper 80's, so I had no reservations about washing up in the wide open.
The Ride:  Continued east on Rt 41 to Miami, then turned south on 57th Ave to Coral Gables.    Today's ride was a slow one, with a brutal headwind and no cloud cover (11.0 mph avg, 17.3 max mph - wheeeeee!).  And, to top it off, I had a flat tire.  Not mushy-can't-ride-it-gotta-fix-it flat, and not flat enough to bother pumping it up, but flat enough that it slowed me down. In Coral Gables I'm staying with my friend Steve's Aunt and Uncle, Julie and Terry Connor.  They live in a beautiful two-story Spanish-style house on a palm lined street, and I'm staying in a little guest house out back with, get this, a warm shower!  Terry took me to a bike shop in Coral Gables, and I bought a new rear tire to replace the treadless wonder that's been giving me flats lately.  That's two rear tires I've gone through on the Tour, and I've still got the same front tire with hardly any signs of wear. Tonight Julie, Terry and I went to hear a talk given by William Langewiesche at a great local bookstore called Books and Books.  His new book is called American Ground: Unbuilding the World Trade Center, and it was very interesting to hear him talk about the culture of the workers at the site.
Yesterday I woke up (a good way to start the day), and decided to go to Miami Beach for the day with the bike but without The Pig, to hang out on the beach and ride around a bit.  Well, the Metrorail nazis put the kibosh on that plan.  They wouldn't let me take the Metrorail since I don't have a pass, and they would not bend one bit.  But, that's ok, because my legs were telling me that they really didn't feel like working today, especially since they haven't had a rest day since Tallahassee.  So, I went to the Coral Gables library and sat in air conditioning, reading this and that.  It was a great way to spend the day. This morning I hung out with Julie and Terry for a bit, then shoved off at about 9 am.  Traffic was still pretty heavy, but I managed to get out of Miami without incident. The Ride:  Rode south on 57th Ave to Old Cutler Rd which, among other roads, I rode southwest to Rt 997.  I rode Rt 997 south through Homestead to Florida City, ditched The Pig at the Everglades Hostel, then rode west on Rt 9336 into Everglades National Park.  After hanging out there for a bit, I rode back to the hostel to spend the night in air conditioned comfort.    In Everglades NP I spent some time in the visitor's center, then walked the Anhinga Trail, an elevated boardwalk that winds its way through some deeper water areas inside the park.  I saw lots of birds, as well as about ten alligators, all over eight feet long.  Very impressive.  It was a great way to spend the afternoon.   
This morning I got up and started riding early.  I knew I'd have a headwind, so I wanted to get the bulk of today's ride finished before the afternoon winds really started whipping. The Ride:  Rode south from Florida City in Rt 1 to Key Largo, where the road turned southwest.  I continued on Rt 1 and various bike trails and side roads that parallelled Rt 1 through Tavernier, Plantation, Islamorada, and Lower Matecumba Beach to Layton.    I stopped at a gas station in Plantation to guzzle a Gatorade - the day was hot, and the heawdinds were brutal, exhausting, relentless, etc.  As I was drinking the Gatorade outside the gas station, I looked at a newspaper to see the election results from yesterday, and I saw a blurb about me and the Tour, more on pg 18.  So, I bought the paper, and on pg 18, sure enough, found full page article.  So that's what that phone interview in Miami was about! In Layton I'm staying at Long Key State Park, and it's great.  The campsites are covered, and are located just off the boardwalk on the Atlantic side of the Keys.  I arrived at camp at around 2 pm, so I had a few hours to goof off on the beach. My best friend Kurt from Portland flew into Miami today, and he stopped by camp at around 9 pm, with bullhorn in hand.  We hung out for a bit, then he left for Key West to get some sleep before waking up tomorrow to orbit me in his car and generally embarrass me, I'm sure.
At 3 am this morning, I woke up due to the cold.  Cold?  I thought that the warm southwestern breeze would keep me (uncomfortably) warm all night, but when I was awoken by the cool breeze, I knew the wind had shifted direction.  Sure enough, I had a tailwind for today's ride, from the northeast. I couldn't ask for better weather today.  73 deg F, tailwind, not a cloud in the sky, ok.  I'm so glad that I was able to cruise easily today with the cool tailwind, being the last day of the Tour and all.  The scenery was more water than land, and Rt 1 was an easy ride, with big, wide shoulders if there wasn't a bike trail running right alongside the road. The Ride:  Continued south-southwestish on Rt 1 and various bike trails and side roads that parallel Rt 1 through Conch Key, Key Colony Beach, Marathon, across the Seven Mile Bridge (with a big, big shoulder, nice and easy), through Spanish Harbor, Ramrod Key, and Summerland Key to Key West, where I jumped off the bike at the last second and let the whole rig fly into the Atlantic Ocean off a pier near the Southernmost Point.  Just kidding.    A few miles outside of Key West, I was greeted by my friend Kurt and his folks, Jim and Marie (Jim and Marie live right in Key West).  Jim was driving the convertible, Marie was navigating, and Kurt was filming the last few miles of the ride and shouting through the megaphone at the same time while wearing a two-piece suit and tie, cowboy boots, and a cowboy hat.  A true Key West experience.    I followed behind this pace car for probably the last five miles of the ride, all the time being showered with confetti and asked questions by megaphone Kurt to the bewilderment of onlookers/tourists, to mile marker 0, then down Duval St, and finally to the Southernmost Point of the continental United States.  There, the real fun began.    With the camera still rolling, I dipped my front wheel into the Atlantic Ocean and somehow managed to keep the rig from falling in.  Then, Kurt asked me a bunch of questions and read a list of reasons why I rode my bike almost 9,000 miles (more on that later).  When I was good and hot and, needless to say, very embarrassed with tourists scratching their heads and pointing at this freak in spandex with Hawaiian leis around his neck being interviewed by a cowboy from hell with a megaphone, Jim snuck up from behind and smushed a key lime pie in my face.  So now, I'm covered with confetti, sweaty, red-faced embarrassed, with key lime pie on my face, and as soon as I cleaned the pie off my face, a bottle of Korbel is opened and sprayed around, hitting anyone (and everyone) within easy spraying distance.  It was a wonderful way to end the Tour. Song-in-my-Head of the Day:  Margaritaville by Jimmy Buffett.  Seems appropriate, huh?  I saw an ad for Jimmy's restaurant (Margaritaville) somewhere along the way, and the song stuck. A couple of frozen Gino's East Chicago-style pizzas were waiting for me at Jim and Marie's house.  Thanks, Mom and Dad!  We're planning on consuming them on Sunday, and I'll be thinking of you.   
Riding a bicycle, being exposed to the elements, hearing the chain make its way around the gears makes me feel aware, human, and connected, obviously much more so than tearing around the country at 70 mph in a glass-and-steel shell with the AC blasting and not taking time to stop, get out of the car, be aware of the weather, walk around and get sweaty and, if you're lucky, bloody, and talk to some locals.  It's also satisfying to know that I can fix and tune anything on my bike, from fixing a flat to truing a wheel.  I'm not at the mercy of an auto mechanic in B.F.E. who, when asked how much for the repair, replies, "How much you got?" The toughest part of the Tour was leaving the security of a good paying and personally satisfying job.  Economically, of course, the Tour didn't make sense (although it ended up being cheaper than I had planned), but spiritually and emotionally it was the thing to do.  After giving my notice at work, it felt like a weight had been lifted, and the planning shifted into high gear.  So, looking back, I'd say follow your heart because it won't steer you wrong.  Don't discard an idea that at first appears irrational.  If it's something that you think will truly make you happy and enrich your life, even though it involves, say, quitting your job and not being guaranteed a shower every day, then the irrational thing would be to not act on that idea.  I don't think anyone has ever said "I've had a good life, but I wish I would've worked more" on their deathbed.  Whoa, deep thought. As for me, my world view has changed.  I feel more compassionate to others, which I think is a result of the unsolicited acts of kindness I experienced on the Tour as well as the conversations I had with people of all walks of life along the way.  These experiences made me think that each of us is interesting in our own way, but we all experience feelings of joy, sorrow, amazement, frustration, etc. Now, look here, we can all agree that the world is filled to the brim with interesting people and places to discover and experience, and that we're only here for a speck of time on the cosmic scale, so why is there any reason to worry?  Are the things we worry about truly worth worrying about?  Breathe deep (life in, anxiety out) - you are breathing, right? - and make sure you're doing things every now and then that make it easy for you to see that life is beautiful.  Life's too short to be: 1. Feeling like the world is out to get you 2. Not doing what brings you joy 3. Worried about dying 4. Worried about what others think of you 5. More concerned with how you look and, while bike touring, how you smell than how you feel If I were to do the Tour over again, I would try a bit harder to find others to do the Tour with, even if it was with people that I didn't know.  For the first few months, I didn't feel that way - it only hit me during the last half of the Tour.  Now, that's not to say that I didn't enjoy riding solo.  Typically, the first couple of hours each day were spent spinning down the road in pleasant meditative silence, leaving my mind open to whatever thoughts (and songs) want to surface, not checking the odometer much to see how much farther I have until the next town, just enjoying the morning with the voices in my head. The Tour confirmed a suspicion that my heart belongs in the hills.  Even though the hills require more physical effort than the flatlands, I'll take the snow-capped peaks of the Cascades, the steep Wyoming ranges, and the Adirondack roller coaster over the flat plains of the Midwest and the slow-draining swamps of the South anyday. Will I tour by bicycle in the future?  I don't think I can afford not to.  Bicycling is at the core of my being, which is convenient since touring by bicycle is a great way to feel connected to the world and the creatures that inhabit it. OK, enough of my yakking.  For the grand finale, here are 23 reasons why I did the bike tour, according to my friends and family (in no particular order, and gathered by my good friend Kurt Robinson, the Cowboy From Hell): 1.  One too many Forrest Gump viewing parties. 2.  Because a bad day on the bike is still better than a good day in the office. 3.  Because it was there. 4.  I lost a bet. 5.  I have this thing about 'One Less Car'. 6.  To prove that I'm better than everyone else. 7.  So I could get bent. 8.  A life changing event, to get from one state of being to another. 9.  Someone triple-dog dared me. 10. I just wasn't chafed enough. 11. Two words: Yeasty Boys. 12. To see how long I could go on paying rent without actually living in my apartment. 13. Have YOU ever lived in Salt Lake City? 14. I wanted to have the opportunity to buy beer on a Sunday. 15. I thought that by doing this, I would win a year's supply of any beer of my choice. 16. I wanted to see if I could grow a full beard by the time I crossed the finish line. 17. I set out to tour with my favorite band Banyan during their North American tour, but was not notified that due to poor ticket sales, all venues had been cancelled. 18. On a road trip, I see and smell a lot more detail at 15 mph. 19. I needed something to do while waiting for the statute of limitations to run out on those trumped-up "lewd conduct" and "public indecency" charges from the killjoys at Temple Square. 20. Because all the boys at work were teasing me about the songs in my head. 21. To promote Bad and Worse's debut album, "Badder Then They Ought To Be." 22. My cat Biff and I needed some time away from each other in order to contemplate where our relationship was going. 23. I couldn't get any good seafood in Utah.
The most important piece of advice I can give someone going on their first bike tour is this: don't rush it.  Leave yourself time to spend an extra day or two in a town with a good vibe, go on a scenic detour, wait out bad weather, hang out with locals and other bike tourers you meet along the way, etc.  I met more than one bike tourer along the way who did nothing but eat, sleep, ride, repeat - what about relax?  The difference between a loose schedule and a tight schedule can be the difference between a fun trip and a forced march. I'd recommend going on a few shorter tours to get the hang of bicycle touring.  I went on two three-day rides the fall before the Tour, and I'm glad I did.  Immediately after the first ride I replaced my saddle with a big cushy Specialized saddle (9,000 miles on a $10 saddle, folks), and bought a one-man tent (small, lightweight, but still withstood high winds and a few snowstorms) to use instead of my 4-season 2-1/2 man tent (big, heavy). Also, it definitely doesn't hurt to join the Adventure Cycling Association.  As a member, you get discounts on their great bike maps, a copy of The Cyclist's Yellow Pages, and their monthly magazine.  And no, they didn't pay me to say that. The pages that fall under this one contain info on what worked and, more importantly, what didn't work for me on the Tour.
Spin at a high cadence (90 rpm).  Any lower and your legs will get tired pretty quick.  I was on the bike for about six hours a day, so I avoided any sudden, sustained bursts of energy, unless there was a dog in hot pursuit. Before the ride I looked at the bike and imagined what could go wrong during the ride.  I took all the tools to repair a flat, turn every bolt on the bike, true the wheels, replace a spoke, etc.  Everything short of removing / replacing the cranks, removing / replacing the bottom bracket, servicing the wheel hubs and headset, removing / replacing the freewheel, and welding the frame.  Get to know how to maintain your bike.  Here are the mechanicals that I had along the way: 1. About 20 flat tires.  I usually patched them until they had about three patches already on them, then it was time for a new tube.  I probably went through four tubes.  Make sure you have the right tube for the tire you're using.  I had a difficult time finding tubes that would work for my 26x1.25 tires.  Also, if you're towing a trailer, bring a spare tube along - my trailer had two flats during the Tour. 2. Two broken rear deraileur cables, both of which happened in the middle of nowhere.  After breaking the second cable, I wised up and relubed the cable housings whenever they felt dirty (usually after a rain storm). 3. In Syracuse, when I was staying with friends, I replaced the chain and the rear cassette since they were worn out.  Now, at the end of the Tour, they again require replacement. 4. I replaced my rear tire twice and my trailer tire once.  The front wheel is the same one I started on, and still has some miles left before replacement. I was surprised that I didn't break a spoke.  For that matter, I never had to turn a spoke to true the wheels.  I used a downhill mountain bike rim for the rear wheel, which I think was a wise move.  It slowed me down a bit, since it's heavier than a normal rim, but it stayed true and felt solid. If you're debating whether to take something or leave it behind, I'd take it if you have the space.  Don't be a weight weenie, especially with tools.  It won't matter, you'll get used to the weight.   
Almost every library has free Internet access.  Usually I'd update the website, check e-mails, and most importantly, check the weather.  The Weather Channel website has an accurate wind forecast for the next day if you click on Detailed Forecast. During the start of the Tour, when the weather was cool, I didn't need to shower every day since I wasn't sweating.  But during the heat and humidity of the Midwest, a daily shower was necessary. First I'd look for a campground to take a shower.  In the Midwest, during the height of the summer, my first place to look was at the local public pool (they usually don't charge).  If there's no campgrounds or public pools in town, I'd look for a YMCA or YWCA (usually $2 a shower).  Barring that, I'd look for a gym / health club.  Nope?  Then I'd resort to the restroom shower.  Grocery stores are the best for this - you're almost guaranteed not to be interrupted since people rarely use the restrooms at grocery stores.  The ideal situation is a big ADA accessible stall with its own sink and a floor drain (oh yeah, make sure the restroom has a floor drain).  Otherwise, lock the door and go nuts.  Just make sure to dry the floor with paper towels when you're finished.  If you're organized, the whole process should only take a couple of minutes. No restroom shower?  Then head to camp and use a couple of Pampers Wet Wipes. Trust me, Pampers are the way to go - accept no substitute. I washed my clothes at a laundromat every week or so.  I had three short sleeve and one long sleeve lightweight shirts, three pair of bike shorts, six pair of socks, a fleece jacket, two pair of bike gloves (short and long finger, make sure they have plenty of padding to avoid numb fingers), and three bandannas.  Nothing cotton except for the bandannas.  I had a few t-shirts, a pair of convertible pants, a couple pair of cotton boxers (ok, the secret's out), wool socks, slip-on Merrell shoes, and flip flops for times when I was off the bike (at camp, in cities, etc.).  For wet, cold weather, and for something to wear at the laundromat while washing all the other stuff, I had Gore Tex pants, socks, gloves, and a jacket. If you don't have a cell phone, phone cards work well.  I cancelled my home phone and used a voice mail answering service (cheaper) during the tour, and decided not to get a cell phone since (1) I was riding through B.F.E. where cell phones wouldn't work anyway, and (2) I wouldn't use it enough to justify the cost. Post offices are your friend.  If you need something sent to you along the way (urgent bills, cookies from Mom), pick a town about a week away, then have the stuff sent to that town at the following address: (your name) General Delivery (town, state, zip) Simple as that.  They'll hold it for about two weeks, and after that, it disappears into the ether. A word of warning: if you're going on a long tour and don't do any regular exercise except for the ride, you'll lose strength in everything above the waist, and your legs will hurt when you walk / run.  It's about two weeks since my last day of the Tour, and I'm a hurting unit after lifting weights and running, getting ready for the ski season.  Looking back, I would've done some pushups and situps each day after the ride (but no burpies), even though the last thing I felt like doing after six hours on the bike was more exercise. As far as what to take for camping, use the same stuff that you use for backpacking.  Tent, sleeping bag, inflatable sleeping pad with a chair converter, tarp, stove, bug juice, lights for reading, yadda yadda.
During the last couple of months of the Tour I had a pretty good system.  Besides the foods listed below, I'd also have Pop Tarts, Snickers (the best candy bar for energy - trust me), and peanuts (for protein) on hand in case I was hungry and there wasn't a grocery store in the immediate area.  "Eat before you're hungry," sure, but some days are more demanding than others and hunger crept up on me a few times.  On a bike tour, it's more like, "Eat until you can't stuff any more food through your pie hole." Breakfast didn't vary much.  It was usually four packets of oatmeal (boil two cups of water with the stove) with some raisins or dates sprinkled on top to provide flavor and texture. Lunch was a chance to refuel as well as a chance to rest the legs.  I'd usually eat lunch at around 1 pm, and I'd buy lunch at a grocery store.  Ideal lunch: one banana or apple, two yogurts (lowfat, not nonfat), something crunchy like Doritos, Pringles, or pretzels, 32 oz of Gatorade (from the powdered mix), and a chocolate goodie to cap it all off - Kit Kat, Butterfinger, one of Mom's homemade cookies that she sent me, etc. Dinner was usually one of two things, cooked at camp: pasta or burritos.  I ate a lot of Velveeta Shells and Cheese at the start of the Tour, but later my body was telling me, "Enough!", so after that it was either pesto pasta or pasta with a red sauce.  For burritos, I usually had a can of refried beans with a vegetable (corn, mixed veggies in a can, etc.), taco seasoning, cheese, whatever.  Anything that sounded good at the time.  Of course, if there was a Pizza Hut buffet in the town where I was sleeping, I'd belly up to the boofay and eat 'til I couldn't eat no more.  Mmm ... pizza buffet.  I never bothered to check back and see if I put any of those Pizza Huts out of business, but I wouldn't be surprised. I used a Primus Himalaya multifuel stove, and decided to use unleaded gasoline as the fuel.  The stove runs great on white gas, which is cleaner than unleaded, but I figured that white gas would be tough to find along the way in anything smaller than one gallon containers.  Also, it was fun to pull up to gas station and fill up my 11 oz fuel canister with $0.12 of the highest grade unleaded available.  Make sure you know how to clean your stove at camp, especially with unleaded.  Unleaded is dirty, and leaves things black and clogged. My stove needed frequent cleaning at the start of the Tour, but not as much later - maybe the stove was used to the nasty fuel by then.
1. Indoors: With friends and family.  It was great to visit with family outside of a big family reunion setting, and I hung out with some friends and family that I hadn't seen in years. 2. Indoors: With someone from the Warm Showers List.  I wish I would've heard of this list earlier in the Tour.  Check it out if you're planning on going on a bike tour. 3. Outdoors: At a free campground.  I found most of these in the Midwest, right in town, and most of them had warm showers. 4. Outdoors: In the woods, away from a busy road, where no one can see me.  This is where I slept most often on the Tour (It's cheap! It's quiet! The woods! Hey, I'm camping!), and I followed the rules of Leave No Trace.  During the last couple months of the Tour I didn't bother with digging "catholes" anymore for solid waste, I'd pack it all out in a plastic grocery store garbage bag and pitch it in the first trash can I'd see.  As for selecting a site, a dirt road with a chain across it and a No Trespassing sign (but not a This Means You sign) works great.  If it was raining, I'd try not to set up my tent under the canopy of trees, because I would want to break camp when the rain stopped the next morning without water from the trees dripping on me. 5. Outdoors: At a fee campground.  I mostly stayed at these at the start of the Tour as I was still getting the hang of bicycle touring, and also in bear country.  Many campgrounds in bear country have bear boxes, secure steel boxes for all your food and anything that could have a food scent on it (basically, everything except what you need to sleep). Along the way I stayed at a few hostels: in big cities (e.g. Washington D.C.), when the weather was really bad (e.g. Kitty Hawk during Tropical Storm Kyle), or when the hostel was highly recommended (e.g. Hostel in the Forest).  I'm partial to hostels over hotels, even if the price were the same.  Staying at hostels is a great way to meet people of all ages from all parts of the globe and feel connected, and I think that's truly what gets our juices flowing - feeling connected to others.
I shipped my bike from Key West to Seattle via Greyhound.  It cost me $50, whereas the plane would cost $75 - $100, depending on your carrier.  Bike boxes are readily available for free at local bike shops. I checked the trailer on my flight from Miami to Seattle.  Before shipping the bike I took off the trailer fork and stuffed it in the bike box, so the trailer didn't have anything pointy on it when I checked it.  The ticketing agent looked at it funny and kept referring to it as a bike, and I kept reminding her that it wasn't a bike, but a trailer, basically just a bag with a metal shell and a wheel on the back.  They didn't charge me to check the trailer (gee, how nice of them), and it was waiting for me at the Seattle baggage claim area, with other travelers staring at it and wondering what it was. It was a very long flight from Miami to Seattle via Chicago, which is when it really hit me that I rode my bike across the country, and then some.  I'll take the bike over the plane any day.
Q: Would you do it again? A: I'll definitely go on more bike tours in the future, but probably not the same route.  In fact, definitely not the same route.  I'd like to do some touring in Europe, in New England during the fall colors, and along the Smoky Mountains.  I'll definitely ride RAGBRAI again. Q: I'm considering a tour from Chattanooga to Key West. I've heard some pretty nasty things about riding in Florida, particularly on US1. I was wondering if you would share your experiences on that particular stretch of road. A: I also heard some horrible stories about riding along Rt 1 between Key Largo and Key West, but I was glad to see that those stories come from the age when Rt 1 didn't have a shoulder.  Rt 1 was my favorite road to ride on in Florida - if it wasn't a separate bike path, it had a wide shoulder.  These photos were taken every 20 miles from Homestead to Key West, so you can be the judge:            A couple more photos here and here. Now, as for the rest of Florida ...    Q: Say, did you ever put together a map of your journey? A general sorta, waypoint kinda map would be nice. A: The following image and highlighting my trusty 1994 Road Atlas are the extent of mapping the journey.  Close enough!   

Planning: Amtrak to Longview, TX.  The train fare is LESS than what it would have cost just to take the bike on a plane!  So I've given up a day on each end to save the money. Generally, I ride into Louisiana, then south to the coast, then east to Ocean Spring, MS where my sister lives.  I'll spend whatever "slack time" I have and then leave again along the coast to Pensacola. The return trip: Greyhound to New Orleans, Amtrak to home. I have the Amtrak tickets, but I'll wait on the Greyhound tickets until I get to Ocean Springs.  This gives me the option if interrupting the trip early and returning to New Orleans in time to meet the train going home. I've been using DeLorme's Atlas Deluxe on the computer to plot a route.  It looks like around 750 miles, but I know it'll turn into more than that.  I also have a paper-copy of DeLorme's Louisiana State map which I'll take with me or at least copies off.  The computer printed maps just don't seem to cut it but it's useful for planning.   
Yesterday, 4/13, I rode a 40-mile loop, out from Chicago along the North River Trail and back through the Botanic Garden and south along the North Branch Trail.  My knees started to hurt, so I started spinning (i.e., shifting to lower gears and pedaling faster instead of harder) and that seemed to fix that problem.  However, my tail started to hurt and there's no easy cure for that except to keep doing it. The following Thursday 4/16, I rode out to O'Hare Field in Chicago, to see if my web page instructions were still current.  About a 30 miles round-trip.  Wasn't as bad, I bucked a headwind going out but had the wind at my back coming home.  The page I was updating is at http://www.neiu.edu/~rkastig1/bike/bik2ohar.htm . Yesterday, 4/25, I participated in the monthly Last-Friday Chicago Critical Mass Ride.  Maybe 30 miles overall, including the trip to and from downtown.  Actually, the Ride itself is almost too easy to be called a training ride, but I did at least get out a little further than the local grocery store! More information at Chicago Critical Mass Starting the countdown: less than a week left before I leave!
I asked at the ticket counter about adding a sleeper - $220! Gulp, no thank you. I asked on the train about adding a sleeper.  $36!  And that included meals. The train left on time, I had the steak for dinner. Throughout this journal, I took pictures.  There's four "albums" of pictures, with some annotation, at: http://community.webshots.com/user/kastigar 
Set up the bike for the trip, left around 2 pm.  It was hot, mid-80's and humid. The road to Tatum was very hilly.  The total distance was 29 miles.  When I got to Tatum, the 8-room motel/apts was full, had to ride 5 miles out of town to Martin Lake State Park.  Nice campground, however.  Hot showers.  I didn't see any way to register, so I didn't.  In the tent by 8:30 or so. On the road for about 6 hours, but only pedalled about 3-1/2.     
No motels in Logansport!  Found another (free) spot in a trailer park which some lady directed me to.  Actually, the trailer camp was back on the Texas side of the Sabine river.   Got a little lost on the way - someplace in Carthage I actually rode north about 5 miles, thinking that I was going south.  As a result, I missed the central business district in Carthage, TX - if there is one.   Weather was overcast all day.  No sun, but around 80 or so.  Didn't put suntan lotion on until late afternoon, no harm done.   
Good breakfast in Logansport - bacon, eggs, grits, toast.   Got talked into heading up Rt 509 instead of going straight east on 84.  Truck stop, supposed to have showers but didn't.  But a pretty good lunch, beef tips and rice.  Little spicey.  Continued east to Rt 1, then south. Wind picked up pretty good (this was the day after the tornadoes north of where I was) so I spend about 90 minutes in a little country church yard.  Good potential place to camp during the week anyway.  Grass was cut, set way back from the road, isolated.  Even running water from a spigot in the back.  So I took a sponge bath and spread out the towel and took a nap for about an hour.  Crossed over the Red River into Coushatta around 6 pm or so, found a cheap motel ($28) which was well back from the road, quiet, and cool.  Chatted with a couple of 'old boys' staying there, living there, I think.  Went out to the local fast food/fried chicken place and had a shimp dinner.  Met up with a couple more locals, guy named Glascow and the owner of the motel I was staying at.   Total mileage today around 60 miles.     
Rode into Campi, small town - no library - one gas station.  Then took 486 to LA 6 and into Natchitoches.  Crossed the Red River again, this time going east-to-west.  By around 2 pm I made it to Natchitoches.  (Kinda hard to pronounce)  Some rain, but not much.  I went to the public library in Natchitoches.  Chain slipped of the front drivewheel, and I'm not too sure about the front derailleur.  No bike shop in Natchitoches, though.  I may have to wait until Alexandria, which is about 50 miles away.   Natchitoches is kindofa tourist-y town, too rich for my blood to stay her unless I can find a cheap place out of town.  There are a couple of campgrounds west of the city.   Changed my mind: it started to rain again, and the Days Inn was only 40 bucks. Right across from the university, and a couple of restuarants nearby.  However, no more luck with the pictures: Louisiana's Northwestern U. is running NT, and the USB ports don't work.  Ergo, no pictures to put up yet. So, in summary I only rode 39 miles today, and quit about 3 PM, which is early but the next stop, Alexandria is 50 miles south and not much in between unless I want to camp again. ...and there is a LOT of swamp land, even this far north in Louisiana so camping, especially stealth-camping, isn't very high on my agenda. Actually, it was worthwhile staying - met up with some cyclists on a tour, part of Cycle Main Street - something like that.  We swapped stories.  There's was an organized tour.  Had fried catfish at a place called McGee's Patio, pretty good.  Tried to get access at the University - no luck.  And their USB ports didn't work since they were using Windows NT!     
A light mist turned into a heavy mist, so I put on the rainshoes, put everything under plastic, and continued on.  About mid-morning it quit so I changed clothes again.   Took a complicated route involving 494 to 419 back to rt. 1, which pretty much follows the Cane River.  Several plantations along the way, including a plantation with a for-sale sign! Along the road someplace, I met up with the older couple from southern Illinois who were on the tour.  We shared a bottle of water, and chatted some more.   In Cloutierville, met up with a retired displaced Chicagoan!  He wanted to chat about all the old neighborhoods.  He knew Sis Daley died, but didn't know about Meig's Field being torn up, so I got to share that bit of gossip. This area is filled with a lot of pecan farms.  Big fields with big trees all nicely in rows.  The few stands I saw were closed, or I would have investigated pecan farming a little.   At the start, Rt. 1 was flat, but then turned into gently rolling hills,  but with the south wind left over from yesterday it was still tough going.  Fried chicken for lunch in Boyce.  At the edge of Alexandria, I came across St. Mary's Residentail Academy, a home for retarded kids.  Services the whole state.  There was an attractive bench under a tree, so I stopped for a while, but then was politely asked to leave by an administrator and guard.  I must have ridden in behind a car before the gate closed, as they had to open the gate to let me out again.  Still, it was a nice break in the day.   It was a pretty hot day, so I continued down Rt. 1, a busy commercial strip until I came to a Motel 6, the closest, which I grabbed just to get out of the sun.     
Breakfast at Schonies, not really great but filling.  Left the motel around 7:30am, now following rt. 71 south.  There was some frontage road, but it was kinda rough.  Rt. 71 did have a pretty wide shoulder.  Maybe the worst day for the wind, though.  Avg. speed was onlyu 5-7 mph.  Took Rt. 456, which roughly parallels 71.  Found this happened often: a little road that paralleled a big road.  Smaller, but usually shadier and less traffic but sometimes harder to deal with the traffic because the road was narrow. Got worried about where to stay, but Bunkie was bigger than I though.  Cheap motel ("truck parking" is always a good sign!) then rode a couple of miles to Rockie's Bar anbd Grill.  Had the seafood gumbo, with Rockies own special roux.  Didn't realize how spicey it was until I finished.  Had a 2nd Barq's Root Beer.  Then stopped for an ice cream cone on the way home. Also bought a large size beach towel.  When I tood a nap earlier in the day, I realized the towel I was carrying wasn't quite big enough.   At 7:30, when I returned to the motel, it was still very windy out, so I'm glad I quit early. 
Continued down Rt. 182, which turns out is going to be my principal route.  It's the old Rt. 90.  Before that, it was called the Spanish Trail. At Opollusa (sp?) had the first flat.  But, right in front of a truck repair shop with a high pressure air hose.  Tiny tack sticking right in the sidewall, so I had no problem finding the leak.  Patched it, filled it, and I was on my way.  Would that all flat tires were that easy. Hot, in the high 80's again.  Pretty much intermittent strong wind from the south again.  Went through Beggs, Washington, a few other small towns. Saw some rice fields, chimney ants, and took a nap someplace north of Lafayette.  When I woke up, an Acadian gentleman came over with a large glass of root beef for me.   Stayed in a cheap motel that took only cash.  The air conditioner worked.     
Ran into one of the cyclists from earlier, fixing a flat.  I helped a little bit, it was an upscale bike, 150 lb. pressure tire!  He had a CO2 cartridge for filling it, maybe a good idea. When his buddies returned, they suggested a route - which I tried to follow and got lost, very lost.  Bunch of numbered bike route signs, plus some paint markings on the road.  In different colors.  One was called "Cajun Man's Route."   Anyway, I wound up in St. Martinsville, which I didn't intend to go to.  Got turned around in the right direction, after asking.  After arriving in New Ibertia, found out the next motel was about 30 miles, and it was already mid-afternoon so I decided to stay.  Went to 5:00 PM mass at St. Peter's.  Long, full, high mass.  These people take their religion seriously.  But it was in English, with a strong cajun accent.  Rode out of town to a place recommended and had a bowl of seafood gumbo.  It didn't taste spicy - until I finished it but then it was too late.   Rode around the park, then around Teche Bayou.   Went to the library and updated a couple of days but still couldn't upload the pictures.  When I went back to the motel, I couldn't find my maps!  Went back to the library and found 'em in the garbage, which must have happened when I threw some other stuff away.  I think the heat and sunshine does something to your brains.  Short term memory seems to go.  It's easy to get befuddled. Went to the local tourist info place (about 5 miles west of my route) to check on the home of Joseph Jefferson.  (19th century actor, for whom the Chicago Jeff Awards are named)  The place is no longer open.  It was a combination of Joe Jefferson and the Rip Van Winkle Garens, because Jefferson played Rip Van Winkle on broadway, his most famous part.   Minor disaster a few years ago: drilling for oil in a lake, they broke a hole into a salt deposit, draining the lake!  One home got destroyed, and some minor damage was done to the Jefferson home as well.   I didn't go out there since it wasn't open.   An observation: amongst the litter on the road, there's lots and lots of plastic beads.  Necklaces, bracelets.  I dunno.  Plastic beads seem to be pretty popular down here.   Todays avg speed was 7.9, maximum was 18 mpg.  I was out riding for 9 hours, but the bike computer said I pedalled for 5-1/4, so I must have spend the difference sitting around or napping or something.       
Saw a sign warning of bears! Went through Baldwin and Berwick.   Got directions back to Rt. 182, and finally crossed the Atchafalaya River into Morgan City.  Ate at my first Waffle House,  my favorite!  Then rode out to Lake End Park, and camped for the night.  Sunday night, it was crowded and noisy.  Bunch of kids, not camping, in the camping area.  If you ride down this way, avoid this park.  Actually, it settled down later.  I set up the tent as far away as I could.  There was even a guy camping there with a full set of drums set up under a screened-in tent!   Showers worked. Planning ahead a little, I think this 182 will take me somewhat back to New Orleans, but I'm going to have to ride on Rt. 90 at least part of the way.       
Flat country, criss-crossed by bayous, streams, and canals.  It seems like every road runs along a bayou, and most of the times there's a road or street on the other side as well.  Occasionally, a bridge crosses over the bayou.  About 17 miles to Gibson, and then about 20 miles or so along Bayou Black.   Wound up in Houma and decided to try and find a bike shop to see if I could get somebody to look at my derailleur, which has been slipping.  Got directions to two bike shops, in the same area, but about 5 miles out from the downtown, historic, district.  Both of 'em closed on Mondays!  A conspiracy?   One of the bike shops was near Duet Street.  I mention this, because I know how I would pronounce this, but it isn't pronounced the way you think.  It's dew-AY Street.  I was going to ask what their word is for two people singing together, but I didn't ask.   Houma is known as the Venice of the South.  Canals and Bayous all over the place.  Park Street and Main Street are each one-way streets, basically north-south, and run along side of the Black Bayou, I think.  Then there are streams and bridges that cross into the bayou, and every couple of blocks a bridge crossing over the bayou, to the street on the other side.   I checked into the Sugar Bowl motel, reasonable.  Then went looking for Robbie Po'Boys, which a local itinerant mentioned as cheap.  Up and down Park and Main again a couple of times, and by the time I found it, it was closed. So I decided to explore the town a little.  Nice town.  Big church, with a cemetary adjacent, the typical southern swamp area cemetary with the graves all above ground. So to get a sandwich, I stopped at a local, almost yuppie-like coffee shop (no Starbucks down here!) and had a great roast beef and cheese sandwich, dressed.  And the coffee shop had internet access as well.  Can you beat that?  Yes, when I left I rode a couple of blocks to a local ice cream shop and topped it all of with a chocolate malt. And wound up getting back to the motel around 8 PM, riding in the dark.  So what started out as quitting early wound up as getting to bed late, by the usual biking standards.   Left the campground at 6:30am, got to Houma at 3:30 PM.  9 hours on the road, but only 6 hours pedalling, so I must have sat around 3 hours.  Avg spped was 8.6, with a max of 21 going down after crossing a bridge near Amelia, the intercoastal waterway, I think.       
Followed 182 out-of-town but missed a cutoff I wanted, so instead wound up on Rt. 90.  Like an expressway, so I got off at Rt. 1 and backtracked to Raceland, and I'm following Rt. 182 again.  Right along the road, the Raceland Public Library, so I thought I'd catch up a little. Route 182 is going to peter out, though, and I'll be stuck riding on 90 again. And it did, and I was.  Nothing really spectacular along Rt. 90, almost like riding an expressway.  Wide 4-lane highway, with a very wide shoulder.  Good for travelling, not at all scenic. Where Business 90 splits off to the south, Bayou Signette State Park is only about two miles east of that point.  Ride in found a spot, chatted with a couple of campers, used the shower, set up the tent, in the sack at about dusk.  A little warm, not much breeze so plenty of mosquitoes.  Zip up the tent FAST!         
  Found my way to La Petite Motel, only $75 for two nights.  Only about 14 miles from the state Park to Jackson Square in the French Quarters - could have stayed in the state park, taken the ferry across the river each day.   Minor disaster: had to have the front deraileur replaced.  But Joe's Bike Shop was just a couple of blocks down from the motel, and they took care of me right away. For anybody who's considering travelling to New Orleans, keep these places in mind: La Petit Motel - 2836 Tulane - (504) 822 1420.  Just a couple of blocks out from Broad and Tulane Streets, Rts. 90 and 61.  Near the Criminal Courts building, and only about 10 minutes ride down to the Vieux Carre (French Quarters) and the Central Business District.  Not a fancy motel, cheap, warm shower, cheap, good air conditioner, cheap, and 1st floor rooms.  Cheap, too, if I didn't mention that.  Joe's Bike Shop - 2509 Tulane (504) 821-2354.  Just a couple of blocks south of the motel.   Went to a free concert in LaFayette Square that started at 5PM.  It was OK, pretty much jazz.  I didn't stay long, returned to the Vieux Carre, there was a better street concert there - and impromptu group of street musicians. Truthfully, New Orleans is a city of sounds and smells - neither of which is suitable for internet transmission.  I rode down Bourbon Street and you're assaulted with music - jazz, Zydeco, blues - and smells from the different restuarants.  Stopped for a Po'Boy on the way back to the motel.  The first time ever I found my way without getting lost!  Got back before dark. I'll stay one full day before continuing on to Ocean Springs to visit (freeload) with my sister, Susie.   
Spent the whole day in New Orleans, going nowhere, just pedaling around.  New Orleans is great for just hanging out.  Lots of good places to eat or just snack, lots of interesting people, local and tourists, to just watch.      Left the motel around 7:30am.  (New Orleans is probably more of a late-night city, but it's kinda tough to navigate on a bike after it gets dark; ergo, it's early to bed and early to rise!) The public library, right down Toulane on the bike, didn't open until 10am, so I went looking for an internet cafe.  Found one, took me two hours to bring this journal up-to-date and to upload the pictures.  Very user friendly, allowed me to telnet and to download the desktop application to upload the pictures.  At the same time, I had them burn a CD with the pictures I'd taken so far.  All the pictures, including the bad ones.  I'll sort 'em out when I get home. I took the 'poor-man's-cruise' on the Mississippi: the Canal Street ferry over to the Algiers section.  Some really great seafood gumbo at the Dry Dock cafe right off the dock area.  The last time I was here, I got lost and had a hard time finding my way back, but this time it was easier.  The levee on the west bank has a path along the top.  Paved on the southern section, hard packed gravel on the rest.  So I rode the distance, saw some of the industrial zone. Didn't cost anything to cross the river.     Then I just kinda piddled around the Vieux Carre (the French Quarters) and the Central Business District.  No real destination.  Had bignettes early in the morning with coffee along the waterfront someplace.  Watched the barges travel back and forth.  More tugboats than anything else.  The littlest tugboats had the loundest horns.        Biggest disapointment: the little shop in the Jax Building catterwampus from Jackson Square that used to be famous for bignettes:  well, it's now a Crispy Cream Donut shop!  I like Crispy Creme, but it didn't seem the same at all.   Later on, went back to Jackson Square for a little more impromptu street concert.  Same band, different tourists.   But when the sun started to go down, I went back to the motel to get ready for the next day and travelling again.     
Around 9am, I came to the NASA plant where the manufacture the first-stage rockets for the space program.  Big!  Shortly after that, I came to the Bayou Sauvage Wildlife Area.  Rode/walked the bike along the path, boardwalk into the bayou area.  Saw my first snake, but of course it disappeared to fast to take a picture.  Beautiful area, primitive, scary.  Lots of noises from strange animals or birds, couldn't be sure which.   This isn't a bad route out of the city: I-10 is out of the question, and even Rt. 90 can get busy and crowded so I tried to take the old roads as much as possible.  But soon Almonaster turned into Old Gentilly Road, and that ended back on Rt. 90. Heading east, Rt. 90 turns back into a two-lane road with an intermittent shoulder.  Not much traffic but it does move fast.  Not a lot of highlights along the way.  Crossed several small bridges, may 6-8 along the way.   Near the Fort Pike area, I stopped at the shrimp market where I'd stopped on a trip 10 years ago and saw the whole thing in operation.  This time, it was closed!  Dunno if it's permanently closed or what.  Most of the equipment was still in place, but nobody around.  I found out later that the Lousiana trawling season is open, but the Mississippi season isn't yet.   So I crossed the Rigolets bridge and continued east.  At the roadside rest area (picnic tables and shade, but no facilities) the camera batteries finally wore out, after two weeks.  I changed them, then came across my first alligator in the wild.  Small, there were two of them.  Some local people came out to feed them with what looked like cat food.   Along this way I met up with another cyclists with only a backpack heading for Philadelphia.  A little down on his luck, I think.  Going through a divorce, unemployed, couldn't get in touch with his children, etc.  I shared some Gatorade, gave him a couple of bucks, suggested he get some kindofa water container of something or he was going to get dehydrated.  Right around Waveland, I headed south to go along Beach Road and the Gulf, he continued straight on Rt. 90 which was more direct. I had breakfast earlier, but wasn't hungry but getting near the campground, so I stopped and had a Po'Boy which I coudn't finish.  It seems like you lose your appetite riding.   Arrived at Bucanner State Park around 5pm or so, even registered this time.  The Camp Store wasn't open, so it's a good thing I'd eaten earlier.  Nice spot, not to far from the shower house.  Unloaded the bike, set up the tent, then rode around the park until it got dark and was time to go to bed.   The average speed was 9.3 mph but I achieved a maximun of 24 mph, probably on the downside of one of those bridges leaving New Orleans.  Rt. 90 up to Buccaneer State Park or Bay St. Louis is OK for travelling but no real bargain for scenery.  It's flat, turns back into a 4-lane highway with a wide shoulder. But it's still grinding out the miles. No real place to stop, and it would be tough to find a place for guerrila-camping if that became necessary. At least Beach Road was more scenic, even if it added a couple of miles to the trip. 
The bridge (causeway, I think) is a mile or so long, 4-lane.  Years ago, I rode it carefully on the sidewalk.  I started out that way, but decided to be a little more agressive and 'take the lane.'  I rode out in the right-hand lane, about 1/3 of the way out from the edge.  Cars had to pass by getting into the other lane, then couldn't squeeze by by riding in the same lane as me.  The bridge is flat, so they had plenty of time to see me.  This seemed to work out pretty good, I didn't get run over.  Later on, a similar bridge between Biloxi and Ocean Springs had a much wider sidewalk, so I took the sidewalk for this one. Found a Waffle House and had a real breakfast finally, although later in the day.  Once you cross into Pass Christian, it's pretty much civilization all the  way east from that point.  Long cities, stretched out along the Gulf of Mexico.  Pass Christian, Long Beach, Gulfport, Biloxi.  Lots of sand-drifts, just like our snow-drifts up north in the winter.  Same riding, be careful you don't slip and slide.  When they was across the road, you need to be careful pulling out into traffic.   Still, you're not going to run out of scenery, food, or water.   I did stop at the Beau Rivage, one of the more upscale resorts, just to use their ATM machine.  First ATM I ever ran into that gave me 100-dollar bills instead of 20's.  Well, at least at a casino you can get change easily, without playing too. Made it to my sisters by 3pm easily.  On the road for about 7 hours, but only pedalled 4.75, so I must have spend about 2.25 sitting around.  This ratio seems to have held up most of the trip.     
Sat, like a vegtable, most of the day. Considered my alternatives for the rest of the trip.  Still haven't decided yet.  I think the heat and sunlight makes it hard to think. 
Leaft around 7am heading east, towards Pensacola.  Really a 3-day trip for me, not 2.  Once again, a very stiff headwind most of the day.  That seems to be the story for this trip.  Riding 90 east isn't really a bargain, wide road, wide shoulder in most places but it's commercial/industrial, and where it isn't it's long, flat, boring, and hot.   Cool and misty in the morning.  There's a catfish pond in the yard, and there were several frogs croaking in the morning.  Sounded like a bunch of tuba players trying to get in tune.  At one point, I swear the frogs were playing the theme song from Jaws.  To bad I didn't record it. 10:30, 21 miles: Pascogula. 10:50, 24 miles, the Singing River Bridge.  New bridge, being constructed, to replace a drawbridge.  The eastbound traffic was still using the old bridge.  When they replace these bridges, the build 'em high enough to allow ship traffic under the bridge.  Do they realize what they're doing to cyclists when they build these "hills" into the route! 1:00pm, 37 miles, the Alabama State Line.  There was no fanfare, just a sign. 1:30, 42 miles, Hwy 188.  I almost missed it, or I got onto a sideroad that led to it, I'm not sure which! 4:00pm, 57 Miles, the Fowl River.  'nuther bridge crossing.  Middle-gear headwind again, kept it up. 5:00pm, 64 miles, the foot of the bridge to Dauphin Island.  This is really high and long!  But there was a sufficient shoulder and perfectly useable by bikes.  I was a little concerned about this.  Rain threatening, so I packed the camera up safely.  But the temptation to take pictures from the top of the bridge was too great, so I unpacked it again.    Shortly before 6:30, I arrived at the ferry.  I could have taken the last one, but instead decided to stay at the campground, which was right across the street from the ferry.  $16, a little high, but nice.  I set the tent, went to take a shower, just as it started to rain - hard! But the good news, my tentsite was right next to a community building, enclosed, covered.  The campground lady wanted to lock it up for the night, but I talked her into letting me stay inside so I didn't have to take my bike out.  I slept on a picnic bench!    Rained like hell all night, all I had for supper was a beef and cheese stick for 99-cents from the camp store.  But I was dry, had cranberry juice, nectarines, and grapes. Life is good.  Bikes are fun. 
Anyway, the first ferry wasn't until 8 am so after getting up early I rode the two miles or so back to the 3-way intersection expecting coffee.  Instead what I found was a deli with scrambled eggs, grits, sausages, biscuits, and jelly.  Yum!  Ate outside again at the picnic table.  Even though I was inside under cover all night, the tent was wet and the sleeping bag was damp.  I had left it to dry but it didn't much.  So I boarded the ferry promptly at 8 am.  Not to busy, only two other cars.      Lots of seagulls hitching a free ride across the bay and a bunch of pelicans following.  Seems like the birds enjoyed trying to see how close they could fly to the people on the ferry.      Not far off on the other side, maybe 12:30 or so, I came to Gulf State Park - and took a refreshing afternoon shower.  Nice area for riding.  I had been following Rt 180, but it was really Rt. 182 I intended to follow, so I was slightly lost.  But I found my way back to Rt. 182. In the Gulf State Park and continuing to Orange City there was an off-road bike path started that continued through most of the city, and even when it ended there was a bike lane marked on the road shoulder - again separated from the traffic lanes by a couple of feet.   This terminated abruptly at the Florida state line.  That shoulder went to zero, nothing right at the state line.  Found my way to the Big Lagoon State Park, and a library about a mile away.  However, the only place with something to eat was a Burger King so I compromised on my promise to stay out of chain places.   Nice park, but the whole park is nicer than the campground.  I got in a spot right across from the toilet and shower.  However, no cover.  The shower was up a hill, and a set of about 20 steps or so up.   Funny thing I noticed about the shower area: in the men's room there was a handicap equipped toilet and shower both - but there was no way for a handicapped person to make it up to the building!  A high set of stairs only on both sides, no ramp, and the only alternative was climbing up through the sand.  So what was the point of equipping the stalls for handicapped use?  Some government regulation?  I all for making these things available to the handicapped, but for heaven's sake why at the top of a hill they couldn't possible climb? The campsite was set up for an RV and the gravel was impenetrable with the tent stakes.  I found I could move the picnic bench out and the area where the picnic bench was, was soft.  So I set the tent up there.  Then I noticed I was only about fifteen feet or so from a creek or bayou.  Alligators?  Snakes?  Too late to move.  All kinds of life, though.  They started singing early and kept it up late.      Around 9pm I awoke to the rain.  So I dashed outside and quickly put the rain-fly over the tent.  The bike bags were secured under plastic and the important stuff (camera, shoes) were inside the tent.  So I crawled back in, damp, and tried to sleep.  That rain fly really cuts down on what little breeze there was, so it became warm and damp and the frogs and wildlife set up a real symphony.  And the rain continued - all night long.  A real gully-washer.   In the morning, the tent was wet, the sleeping bag damp, the bugs were out in full force.  Not quite the accommodations of the night before.   After over two weeks of no rain at all it was mostly psychologically difficult to deal with rain two nights in a row. 
By 6:00 or so it started to get light.  I packed the wet tent, damp sleeping bag, and everything else.  The gas station with coffee was about two miles from the campsite, but it had real cream (most of the places use that powdered stuff), blueberry muffins, and a picnic table outside well away from the gas pumps.  That's nice, if you can put some distance between you and the gas pumps in the morning.  However, the next five miles or so along Beach Road (I think) on the way to Pensacola was about the worst road of the trip.  Narrow, two-lane, no shoulder - and a tremendous amount of continuous traffic.  Perhaps commuter traffic into Pensacola?  It was moving pretty fast for a country road, and frequently cars would pass.  That is, the first car behind me would slow for me, but the second car couldn't see me and would pass the first car.  By the time both cars came along side me, there was no room for the first car to nudge over to the left to allow me additional room.  I had to pull off into the grass a couple of times.  Once, a pickup truck passed another car coming from the opposite direction!  That's a little bit scary, seeing a truck approaching you head-on in the lane you're supposed to be in.   It was about five miles or so before the road gained a shoulder which made riding a lot easier.  And, looking at the map later, there really wasn't much in the way of an alternative route since it's near the coast and most of the adjacent land is swamp.      I opted to head for the north end of Pensacola, the Greyhound station, and a cluster of motels.  Got the ticket, made sure they had a box, checked into the nearest motel, unloaded the bike and prepared for about a 10-mile ride back south to the downtown area and the coast.  Only about 20 miles to this point, but it seemed like a lot more. Pensacola has a nice downtown area, historic, scenic, restored.  Seems like lot of government buildings.  I headed east again, along what I think was Rt. 90, and had a heckova time finding the Welcome Center.  It's set off to the side, along another road, but had a nice park, covered picnic tables, and an entrance to the Fishing Bridge. Fishing Bridge:  Many of the bridges down south were low bridges, causeways actually, with either a turn-bridge or a lift-bridge in the middle to let the ships through.  Many of these bridges were replaced with bridges with a very high section in the middle that ships can pass under.  However, they didn't tear out the entire old bridge - they just cut out a section in the middle.  So you can walk/ride out to the end of these old sections.  Lots of people fishing - and pelicans walking - along these half-bridges.      Yesterday I complained about the lack of bike facilities when crossing from Alabama into Florida - but this section was very bike friendly.  For example: the bridge to Gulf Beach, about three miles long, had a marked bike lane.  This was at the extreme edge of the roadway and there was about a 3-foot "shoulder" between the traffic lanes and the bike lane.  Interestingly, this must have been added later because you could see the old lane markings.  They shaved about a foot off of each of the two traffic lanes, making them narrower to gain an addition couple of feet on the side for the bike lane.  I'm sure AAA wasn't too happy about this.   Before I crossed the bridge I was sitting in the park and it started to rain - heavy rain.     It was around noon and I was about to give up the idea of crossing but it stopped and the sun came out so I went ahead.  Even after crossing the three-mile bridges the bike lane continued or there was a marked path along side the road.  Frequent signs along the bridge or roadway suggested "Watch for Bikes" or "Roadway Shared with Bikes" or something similar.   Another thing I noticed: the motorists all stop at the light behind the white line.  None of this creeping forward stuff.  Sometimes three or four lanes of traffic, but the first cars at the light all lined up at the white line, not at the imaginary line where the traffic signals are.   I had to cross another bridge to get to the outer island.  Pretty much a tourist area.  The right-turn led to the old fort and the sign said "Road Ends in 9 miles".  I didn't ride the entire distance, it was getting late and I knew I had the long 20-mile ride to get back to the motel.  The tourist area is centered around the intersection and it gets a little more sparse at you get away from this area.   But some dark clouds were appearing and I thought I'd better head back.  Getting caught in a rainstorm along a 3-mile bridge without any chance of cover didn't sound attractive to me.  Especially with the wind atop the high part of the bridge.   When I got back to the Welcome Center on the mainland I schmoozed the ladies there for a little more information.  The information they had was very car-centric. One woman did suggest another route back to the area I was staying.  It was along 17th Avenue, a minor through street mostly residential.  This took me to Texar (and that is NOT pronounced like you think it is, it "te-HAR" and she couldn't explain the pronunciation either!) and across back to the highway where I only need to ride a short distance.  Found a local rib joint, Smokey's BBQ, along Pensacola Avenue.  Great!  Pork ribs, pecan-smoked.  A mild sauce.  Baked potatoe and coleslaw, 10 bucks.  Picnic table type of setup inside.  Waitress kept refilling my soft drink.   Pensacola is in Escambia County, and the transit system is operated by the county, not by each city which is a good idea.  The Welcome Ladies, however, weren't at all familiar with the bus system.  I had noticed that all the buses were equipped with the bikes racks in front.  In fact, I saw two busses that had a bike on the rack.  Just for the cheap-thrill I considered taking a bus for part of the distance.  They did dig up for me a 60-page booklet with the various routes - but like any visitor unfamiliar with the terrain I couldn't really figure it out.  It listed about 35 routes, but some were evening and weekend.  Each route formed some kind of loop, and there were transfer points.  It may have been possible to take a bus from the outer islands all the way up to I-10 (which I was staying near) but it would have been necessary to transfer a couple of time.  Sheltered bus stops too.   Another thing the welcome center had was two internet kiosks - which was interesting.  Nobody was using them, and a sign suggested limiting use to 15-minutes or so.  So I check my email.  It did rain a little more while I was there - so it wasn't a bad day when it rains twice and both times I was under cover someplace.   After the rib dinner I got back to the motel before dark No more rain, I could have stayed out later but of course you don't know that at the time. 
This area around I-10, Rt. 29, Palafox Road, Pensacola Highway is known as Car City, and it is.  All kinds of car dealers.  Big ones, small ones, new cars, used cars, trucks, RV's SUV's, anything you want.  Not the most attractive riding area.   But if you stray away into the side roads and neighborhoods it really isn't a bad area.  Lots of trees and vegetation and this cuts down, almost eliminates, the traffic noise.  It was a lot more pleasant than I thought it would be.   About Greyhound:  this was my first experience traveling with the bike by Greyhound, so I got to the terminal around 8:30.   First, the bike box is different from Amtrak or the airlines.  It's smaller but wider and it was necessary to remove both the front and rear wheels to get the bike into the box.  I used their tape and secured the bottom.  I unloaded and secured the two pair of panniers from the bike and checked them as checked luggage.   Even after removing the wheels the bike, removing the pedals and turning the handlebars the bike wouldn't quite fit!  The front-rider lowboy carriers took some room and the kickstand I had was one of those mounted near the rear axle.  When I got done I had to tear a corner of the box, and the kickstand protruded about 6 inches.  Nobody beefed about that, however.   I put the bike in upside down, so this protected the gears and derailleur mechanism.  Of course the wheels went in along side the frame.  When I closed up the box and taped it it was slightly misshapen, but I figured it would travel OK.  I just threw the pedals in the box but forgot to pack the front handlebar bag in so that was one more thing I needed to carry on the bus, along with the tent bag.   There was a bus change in Mobile.  The first bus was a Greyhound, with plenty of cargo space and the bike box stood upright.  I was cautioned by the people at the terminal in Pensacola to watch the baggage handling in Mobile, to make sure the checked luggage stayed together, and got on the right bus.  The policy of Greyhound, I think, is that you are responsible for schlepping your own luggage, though they'll help.   The bus from Mobile to Biloxi was a Trailways bus, and the luggage compartment was smaller - and the box wouldn't fit upright.  They laid it down on the bottom, but put my bags on top.  Only about four people were on the bus for this first leg of the journey so there wasn't a lot of luggage - fortunately.  I was concerned about what would happen if they packed heavy boxes or luggage atop the box and potentially doing damage the dismounted wheels which were the most fragile.   But the bus stopped in Pascagoula and then Biloxi, so there wasn't much chance for damage.  In fact, the bus got off I-10 and followed Rt. 90 most of the way - the same route I'd traveled a couple of days earlier.   I asked about getting a bike box in Biloxi: No.  The terminal there didn't stock them.  So I carefully opened the box and talked them into saving the box for me.  I had a choice: either ride back to New Orleans, leaving Tuesday or staying with my sister and taking the bus to New Orleans leaving on Thursday.  Trying to keep my options open.  I'm pretty sure I can leave the bike in the Greyhound box and put it on Amtrak directly.   Only about a 20-mile ride from the Biloxi terminal to my sister's house in Ocean Springs.  Stopped at Fayards for a Po'Boy Sandwich.  It's a gas station along the route back to I-10, doesn't look like much more than a big gas station until you get inside and find out they have a full deli and tables - and make about the best Po'Boy sandwiches anywhere.  About the best of the trip.  Of course, I had learned about this on one of my earlier trips.  Unless I decide to ride back to New Orleans, this may have been the last day of extensive traveling with the bike. 
It was my sister's birthday, so we put the bike and bags in her SUV (gag!) and went out for breakfast.  At the bridge to Bay St. Louis she dropped me off to ride Beach Road, along the Gulf.  In looking at a map I saw a road I never noticed before that bypassed a lot of Rt. 90.  Lower Bay Road. I explored it and it was a much more pleasant ride.  It bypassed all of the 4-lane section and a good deal of the 2-lane section.  The road actually crossed Rt. 90, but turned into a gravel road which I took anyway, just to see.  It led into Pearlington, a large wide spot in the road, along the Pearl River and eventually back to Rt. 90 which is kind of hard to totally avoid, since it's the only road along the coast with marshed all over the place.  Stopped and watched the same two alligators in the pond - swimming alongside a half-dozen turtles, so I guess they must co-exist. Met up with another cyclists along the road.  He was a local, going east but decided to go back west to ride with me.  We got stopped by a turn-bridge so we watched the boats go through.  A ton of traffic from the west backed up, but not much from the east.  We decided to let it pass, got to talking, and the darn bridged turned again!  So we had to wait another cycle of boats to get across. This was right near the Rigolets area, the Fort Pike Historical Preserve and there's a picnic area and sheltered cover right nearby.  This was around 4pm or so, to late to go on to New Orelans (I wasn't ready to anyway) so I hung around and waited for it to get dark to set up the tent.  It isn't really a campground but it has everything except a shower and bathrooms.  A nice boat ramp to go down and soft-of wash up in the Gulf of Mexico! Beautiful night, soft breeze, the stars were out and it was reasonably cool as well.  Several picnic tables under the shelter so I had most of the conforts and conveniences of home and knew I was only about 30-40 miles from New Orleans. The only bad part - it was a 10-mile ride west the next morning before I found coffee. 
The hard part was the 9 miles before I found an open place to get coffee, but that went by pretty fast.  I think I sometimes miss a lot when I'm riding to find that first cup of coffee.  After that, it was another 6 miles to the Bayou Sauvage area, and I stopped there and looked around again.  I had time to kill since I wasn't leaving until the next day and was so close to New Orleans anyway.   I didn't have a map of New Orleans (this is my fourth bike trip that included New Orleans and I still can't find my way around!) so I decided to stick with Rt 90 all the way.  Turned out not to be a choice ride - it's a busy secondary highway with lots of businesses and industry.  I rode by Old Gentilly Road (the route I'd taken when leaving New Orleans earlier) but stayed on Rt. 90.  It turned into a suburban/business area.  Busy, nothing really interesting except maybe crossing over the high bridge that crosses the navigation canal.   I was at Broad and Tulane (Rts 90 and 61) which was near the motel I was planning on staying, by about 11:30 or so.  Really, I could have taken the train the same day since it didn't leave 'till around 2 PM or so.  So much for planning.  I considered riding to the campground on the other side of the river but I started to get tired and opted for the motel instead.  Rode down to the French Quarter (again!) then decided to unload the bike so I went back to the motel, registered, and got ride of some of the weight.  Took a shower, and a long nap - so I must have been really dragging. Got another map and decided to explore a little more of the city.  Found out that, coming into New Orleans, I could have easily found a way up to Lake Ponchatrain, ridden along the lake, come down through City Park and the Jeff Davis Parkway path.  Next time. So I did take the Jeff Davis Parkway, at least until City Park.  New Orleans has a lot of these parkways or boulevards, divided streets with trees and grass separating the one-way streets.  Jeff Davis has a path right up the middle.  Yes, you have to grapple with the intersections but the traffic is reasonably show and it's not bad.  Not all of the side streets cut through the path, only the major streets.   Returning downtown, I then rode out to the Garden District, only a short distance.  To avoid getting lost (again) I just followed the St. Charles streetcar tracks, then going off the tracks for a block or two into the side streets, making sure I could find my way back to the streetcar tracks again.  The Garden District isn't much different from the French Quarters, except it's all residental, bigger, and more spread out.  Old, though.   Lunch or dinner at a small tavern along St. Charles.  I saw a lot of police cars in the lot, so I figured this must be the place to go.  It was.  A combination plate that included gumbo, jambalaya, and red beans and rice.  A little spicy, but two big glasses of iced tea did OK. Riding into the periphery again, I stumbled blindly across the D-Day Museum, which my brother-in-law, Les, had suggested.  Full of WWII artifacts.  I got there around 4, and it closed at 5, so I didn't get to see much of it.  WWII afficianados would appreciate it.  Seemed to me they had a large contingent of WWII veterans active in the museum. Across the street was a new art museum of some sort - but in a brownstone building I recognized from a previous visit.  Previously, it was a civil war museum.  I didn't visit the art museum but I enjoyed the civil war museum a lot on the previous visit.  A little Political Correctness at work here? Back to the French Quarters for a little (free) entertainment, people watching, and then to the motel shortly after dark.
My usual practice is to take the pair of front and rear panniers, link them together with a threaded chain-link replacement.  Then I use one of the bungee cords that used to strap the tent/sleeping bag stuff bag onto the rear carrier. That way, I have two "bags" to check instead of four.  This is in addition to the bike, which this time cost me a total of $15.  I seem to remember it was more in Chicago - dunno why. I put the stuff I want on the train (toothbrush, book, etc.) into the top of the stuff bag and carry the thing as carry-on luggage.  This gives me the stuff I want plus I have the sleeping bag to snuggle into if I have to sleep in the coach car.   During a bike trip, you're on "Lived-Time" instead of "Clock-Time" so I don't wear a watch but depend on the clock in the bicycle computer if it's necessary. So I take the computer off the bike and put it in my fanny-pack.  The hard part, at the end of a trip, is transitioning from Lived-Time back into Clock-Time.  No problem checking the bike or packing it and I hung around the station for over an hour since I was so early.  Without a bike you can't go to far!   The train was very crowded from the start, and got more crowded as we headed north.  Alas, no sleeping compartments were available.  Worse, some fat girl squeezed into the seat next to me also going to Chicago! My mistake, I think, was dressing like a human being (walking shorts, sport shirt) instead of like a cyclist (grungy shorts, dirty cotton pullover shirt, look like an unkempt bum) for the trip.  Had I looked like a cyclist, I'm pretty sure I would have retained the whole two seats to myself.  This makes sleeping a little easier.  But it wasn't bad, once I shimmied into the sleeping bag.  Woke once during the night, walked around, went back to sleep.  I must have slept pretty good, because I don't remember any of the stops, particularly Memphis which is a 40-minute wait while the uncouple and re-couple cars.   One unexpected thing: my rear-end hurt sitting in the seats.  The tender parts from riding the bike.  No kidding, at that point the bike seat riding seemed more comfortable than sitting.  I never thought I'd have a problem sitting, but I did.  Spent a lot of time standing on the train.  Had breakfast on Friday morning on the train, as soon as the diner opened.  Eating on the train is expensive - around $9, not including tip, for bacon and eggs.  Get the sleeping car (cheap) if you can or else be prepared to bring your own snacks.  Even a cup of coffee from the snack bar was a buck-and-a-half. The train left on time, and amazingly arrived on time in Chicago.  I retrieved my bags, and the lady checking the tags told me to leave them, retrieve my bike from the downstairs shipping, then come back up and retrieve the bags.  This made it very convienient to re-load the bike.  The train arrived around 9 AM, and I was ready to roll out shortly after 10 AM.  Don't try and cheat but load the bike just as carefully as if you were going 100 miles, even though you're only about 10 miles from home. A very pleasant ride back to my apartment! Except that it was comparatively cold, aroung 65 degrees. It even rained a little on the way home. A bike lane on Canal Steet, a bike lane on Milwaukee, a bike lane on Elston, and a bike lane on Lawrence Avenue.  Compared to some of the other cities I visited, Chicago wins hands-down for being bike friendly.  I suppose it helps that I know my way around. 
From a note on the garage wall, I rode 1100.2 miles total. I spent 2 nights on a train, 9 nights in motels, 10 nights in campgrounds, and 7 nights at my sister's house.   When I left Chicago, it was cool 60's.  The south was hot, 80's..  When I returned to Chicago, it was cool, 60's.  Big temperature difference.  On the train ride back, I noticed the corn grew progressively shorter as we sped north.  Most of the trip was hot, but dry.  The only rain was the two days on the way to Pensacola but that was enough to make up for it.  Most of the trip, particularly the first three weeks, I seemed to always be riding with the wind in my face. Northern Texas and Louisiana is hilly, but further south it flattens out quite a bit.   Having friends or relatives at the end of a trip, or near the end, is a big plus.  You don't need to ride to meet a deadline or a ticket-date.  This is the flex-time of the trip: you may spend an hour, a day, or a week visiting - depending on the time it takes to ride the route you've planned.  The big thing is to SLOW DOWN.  Tough to do, psychologically, when you consider the miles in front of you.  Particularly in the start of a trip like this, you tend to rush and maybe bypass things you shouldn't because they'll take an hour or two from the day - and drop your distance by 20 miles or so.  Ride each day as if you'll never return again - because you may not. Camping is not bad, even guerrila-camping or stealth-camping where there are no campgrounds.  I passed a lot of places where I could have safely pitched a tent for the night.  Small churches in rural areas, isolated, are a good spot.  The grass is cut, you can hide behind the structure and not be seen from the road, and even find a water spigot.  I saw several locations along the way that would have served the purpose.  Asking directions is a good way to meet people.  I have the usual "guy-thing" about asking directions, but once I overcame that it became an important part of the trip.  Don't be surprised when people ask YOU for directions.  They figure, on a bike, you must be local.  And the bike makes you more approachable too.  Sometimes you even have a map and can help them out.  Dogs weren't really a problem.  I was never concerned about my safety, and was more concerned about attracting dogs out into the middle of the highway where they could get into more trouble than me! Sleeping is a great part of the trip.  In order to get a good sleep, you need to be both tired and relaxed.  If you don't have both, you won't sleep well.  At the end of the day you are (or should be) both tired and relaxed.  Tent or bed, it's really a great part of the trip, falling asleep each night. Time to start planning next year's wanderings....
If you've made it this far - thank you - maybe you can read a little further. The purpose of this site is to keep friends and family in tune to what I'm up to this summer - traveling from Washington, D.C. to New Orleans alone by bicycle.  I'm afraid that this site will only be a skeleton until late August when I can upload photos and enter more elaborate journal entries.  For the time during my trip (approximately July 15 to August 10) I will be stopping at public libraries throughout the Southeast to enter basic information of my whereabouts and plans and perhaps a few of the more interesting journal entries that I will be writing daily by hand. Please come back and visit again, and if you haven't yet, sign my guestbook.  Thanks!!!
  Show links to this Hide links to this      July, 2001 The idea for this trip came to me during the fall of 1999.  I had purchased Bicycle Across America by Barbara Siegert.  The author, a woman in her 60's, relates tales from her five cross-country bicycle rides.  I was amazed that someone at that age could accomplish such a feat many times over.  I basically figured, "If she could do it, so could I."  The imagination kicked in, and I thought about how a trip like that would incorporate many of the things that I derive enjoyment from:  bicycling, traveling, camping, being outside, getting lost and then finding my way, seeing new places, visiting friends, meeting new people and so on.   So, the decision to do a big trip came awhile back, but I had to wait for the opportunity.  As this past school year went by, I saw the opportunity blossoming for the ride to take place this summer.  Once I had the trip dates in my calendar, I could start planning.  I have enjoyed the planning phase immensely:  where I'll go, who I'll visit, what to bring, what to eat, etc.  So, after I finished a short ed course at UNO early this summer, I packed up my junk and drove to my parents' house in Northern Virginia.  The bike ride was definitely on my mind, but I put it on the back burner as my friend, Pat Lovett, and I backpacked throughout Western Europe (which was, by the way, a great time) for half of June and half of July.   I don't know exactly what to expect out of this trip.  I have done my research, but I will never know how it all feels until I actually go out there and do it.  I think traveling the Southeast at 12mph is going to be great fun - it's just fast enough to be making daily progress towards a goal, but it is slow enough to experience the world around me as I pass through it.  I am excited for the actual riding, but more so, I am excited for the adventure. There will be, of course, problems along the way.  I feel like I have planned quite well to minimize the likelihood of them, but certainly I will face some adversity - be it flat tires, poor weather, unwelcoming townfolk, sore legs...But, it is those tribulations that I will derive the most enjoyment from surpassing.  If everyday was 70 degrees with a tailwind, down hill, on smooth pavement without cars, and with a 7-11 every five miles, the trip would be much less of an experience.
I am very excited for the adventure that awaits me - certainly the biggest traveling one of my life.  I am excited to arrive at my doorstep in New Orleans a few weeks from now with a great accomplishment under my belt.  But, more than all of that, I am excited for the daily tedium of riding.  It will be boring and hot at times, but I hope to transcend all of that and derive pleasure from those things that would aggravate most people. I plan to head out tomorrow morning and make the 12 mile ride into the District of Columbia where my DC-residing relatives (aunt, brother, and sister-in-law) will be there to greet me.  All of us will ride around town for a little bit, do some photo-ops in front of the Lincoln Memorial, and then I'll cross the Potomac for the second time to head south.  This trip will start at one great river and end at another, and it will start in one beautiful city and end at another.  I think when I say good-bye to those folks it will really sink in:  four days to Chapel Hill, North Carolina and no familiar faces along the way - just pavement.   I'm excited.
Accommodations:  Aquia Pines Campground      It felt quite strange leaving my parents' garage and heading out to Georgetown Pike.  I have made that short jaunt by foot, bike, and car thousands of times before but this one was different.  This bike ride would not terminate here.  I headed into the city on some of the wonderful paved trails that Northern Virginia has to offer.  It was early on a Sunday morning but there were joggers and bikers everywhere.      Show links to this Hide links to this      It was special for my family and friends to meet me where I crossed into DC, Key Bridge.  We talked for a little bit and took some photos.  And then I was off, and as I thought it would, I felt awkward.  I wanted to turn around and just hang out with them -- you know, for the rest of the summer.          But I moved on.  I crossed the Memorial Bridge and unofficially started my trip.  From now on I will be heading south and west.  The ten mile ride to Mount Vernon (George Washington's home) was filled with great scenery and a packed bike trail.  I didn't mind the people really, soon I will be the lone biker.  Two different guys struck up conversation with me on this leg - nice folks wishing me well on my trip.      Leaving Mount Vernon, I had about a 25 mile stretch of riding on Route 1.  It may be the predecessor to I95 but it is still used a lot.  But nice shoulders and no big trucks, so no complaints about the road.  Well, except for one thing, it's filled with hills.  I can handle rolling hills just fine:  out of the saddle, in the saddle, repeat once or twice.  But, these hills are much more than that - half milers that can break your will to ride.  I learned quickly to pace myself - no hurry, take a break (repeat). I am pleased with how the rig has held up so far.  I got a flat in Triangle, Virginia (coincidentally, at about the same place I got one with my car five years ago - but this one was at 6mph not 70).  The flat was my fault.  I had the rear tire well underinflated and overweighted.  I changed tubes and decided to break out my new Conti tire that I had in my pannier.  It is a superior touring tire, and I can keep inflated to 110psi.  It is doing much better than the old tire.  I also took my sleeping bag off the back and tied it to my handlebar bag, and that seems to be helping.  I am using the gears on my bike like never before.  I am constantly shifting gears to let the mechanics help me with the work.  I think as this trip goes on I will become even more adept at the use of my 24 gears.  Finally on the rig side of things, my GPS came in handy a few times already.  I have used it to pinpoint my location on a map and figure out how much farther I had to go to the campsite for the night. The campsite I stayed at was quite basic, but it had what I needed:  flat, soft ground and a shower.  My sweat today was very salty probably due to the fact that I haven't worked out this hard for awhile, and I had to get all of those toxins out of me.  I think the half hour it takes to set up camp is the reward for a hard day's work.  Setting up camp while the legs are still throbbing and the endorphins are still pulsating has a very calming effect.  The smell of the campfires blazing, of course, brings back good memories.  Dinner, however, was not the normal camping-fare.  I walked a quarter mile down Route 1 to a Chinese take-out joint:  beef with broccoli and plenty of rice.
Accommodations:  Christopher Run Campground Quote of the Day:  "Work is for people who don't fish" Seen on a bumper sticker at the campground    After doing some research last night, I had to decide between going about 85 miles to a campsite west of Richmond or about 45 miles to a campsite northwest of Richmond.  The decision was easy this morning, because the legs were definitely sore.  I will be making the shorter trek today, and I think that that is the smart thing to do.  In the beginning of this journey it is very important to follow up moderate days (like yesterday) with a lighter day.  Later, when I get in better shape I can double up moderate and/or heavy days with less difficulty. I left the campground this morning after an hour of packing up my stuff.  I am finding that managing my load will be a major aspect of this trip.  I headed out of the campground and south on Route 1 for some more huge hills.  In Fredericksburg (home of Mary Washington College; yeah Michelle!) I started west on Route 3.  I passed a library sign, and I couldn't resist the temptation of air conditioning and internet access.  So here I am at the Central Rappahannock Regional Library in Chancellor, Virginia. -----      After some excellent navigational work through the wiles of the Central Virginia wilderness, I arrived at my destination.  The campground charged me five bucks for anywhere on the green behind the RV camping area.  As I rode through the RV camp a young man in front of his RV, with the Confederate flag flying high above on his makeshift pole, gave me a look of amazement.  I smiled and waved and rode on.  One could only assume what he was thinking.   Choosing a spot on the lawn didn't take long.  Although the area was large and without other campers, I decided quickly on the only spot in the shade.  I set up camp and headed up to the camp grocery in search of food.  Since town was five miles away I figured I would have to make do with whatever they had:  Hungryman Turkey dinner and a microwave.    Otherwise uneventful.  Plotted out course for next day in a gazebo by the lake.
Accommodations:  Bear Creek Lake State Park Campground Quote of the Day:  NONE due to the fact that I saw under 25 cars the entire day and not a single person (besides a few service station cashiers) outside of a car.  The campground was even on an honor pay system.    Today was my best riding day yet.  I was on the back back roads of the state.  I am finding, however, that those back roads, although they are the straightest line between points A & B, aren't necessarily the fastest route.  This is usually due to a large amount of hills that help rack up the miles and the pain factor quickly.  Large state highways aren't so direct but are easier because the road is well developed:  straighter and flatter.  I will keep that in mind as I plan my route through rural Alabama. So, back to the actual riding.  I had a great time on the unlined, empty state routes.  I was less worried about cars and was able to take up some more space in the road.  I had been on gravel state routes before on a cross country road trip (by car) I took after college, but those were only in rural West Virginia.  I didn't think that a state route that is marked clearly on my map could be all gravel, but I found that to be the case with Virginia State Route 608.  It travels through the heart of the Cumberland State Forest.  I was a little concerned at first at how the rig would hold up under those conditions - but it did just fine.  Those 15 miles were probably my favorite of the day.  An hour and a half in the forest with no one else around...just the rig and me cruising swiftly. I have noticed that a lot of the state routes in Virginia (I will probably find it elsewhere) really don't connect anything.  Nor are there residences on the road.  They seem to solely exist for the loggers and for fire-fighting access to the forests.  In fact, about thirty miles of my riding today was done on roads through forests.  I passed an occasional logging truck or VA Department of Forestry vehicle but that was about it.   I had my first dog encounter today.  As I was riding through one of the inhabited areas of the state I passed a house with two older Labs out front, a black one and a yellow one.  The yellow one gave chase, as I suspected one or both of them would do.  I was a little worried because normally I can kick the bike to 25 or 30 and out sprint a dog, but with the decked out darthcycle I wasn't sure I could achieve such high speeds.  The yellow Lab started giving chase, and I immediately pulled out my pepper spray.  I started spinning the pedals pretty hard and for a little bit of time we had a good little race going on.  In the end that poor old pooch was no match for even the weighty speed of the darthcycle - I pulled away to the sounds of winded barks.  I put the pepper spray back in the holster - not needed this time. After I set up camp, I had to decide whether to go pedal the one mile up the hill and out of the creek valley to the general store for dinner or to cook on my own.  I went with the dehydrated meal:  noodles and asparagus in an alfredo sauce.  Of course, when you open up the bag it looks like Gatorade powder but smells worse, but I am amazed what boiling water and a little bit of stirring can do.   The rest of the evening was quiet - just a removal of my first tick of the trip from my right shoulder blade.  Went to sleep to the sound of crickets.
Accommodations:  Days Inn Quote of the Day:  "I like riding my bike from time to time, but I ain't riding to'no Louisiana." The most interesting conversations occur outside of gas station food marts, and that is where I met the author of today's QOTD.  He thought I was crazy, but I took that as a compliment.    Awoke at 5:50 to rain coming in my tent.  I immediately ran outside and put on the rain fly (which I had taken off before I went to bed because it was so hot) and then ran my bike up to the bath house where it could stay dry under the awning.  Because I was up, I figured that I would try and find breakfast.  So, I suited up with my tevas and rain jacket and made the trek to the general store.  I ate breakfast on a picnic bench out front of the store and talked to some of the locals (one of which I asked for directions much later in the day ten miles away).  I bought lunch too and then headed back to the tent for a nap.  I awoke late morning as the sun peaked out and heated the tent up.  I decided to eat, pack up, and make use of the second half of the day. I was just about to leave for the day when the rains came again, this time much harder.  I was wet anyway, and I already had packed up, so I decided I'd head to Farmville.  I had a quick little jaunt (something like a time trial in the Tour De France) southwestward to Farmville.  On the way, I passed by some interesting Civil War sites.  Appomattox Court House is only about 25 miles from Farmville so there are some very interesting late war sites in the area.  I stopped at one of them where the Army of Northern Virginia denied the Union's request for surrender.  I won't go on, but I will say one last thing.  At these roadside sites there is, of course, a sign, but there is also a small radio transmitter where you can tune your AM radio and listen in to a more detailed description of the site.  Naturally I had to stop, pull out my radio and listen in.  The loop of audio that was playing had actors reading letters from troops that depicted what went on there.  It was funny to me that the voices of the Confederates had a thick drawl, and the voices of the Union troops had the classic Yankee accent (one that many Alabamians said I had when I lived there).    I got a pizza from Domino's in Farmville, and I decided to go for the Cynastix as well.  They were quite good, but they do not go well with a large deep dish pizza with tomatoes and mushrooms (mental note). I soaked up as much of the Gary Condit coverage as possible.  Quite interesting, as is Dubbya's trip to Europe.  I went to sleep early, because tomorrow I make a big attempt at Chapel Hill:  120 miles away.  I might make it, I might not.
Accommodations:  Olivia & Courtney's Apartment Quote of the Day:  This one has a little story that goes with it.  Picture it:  Bullock, North Carolina, Tammy's.  Tammy's, that's it - well, it's a gas station (no pay at the pump here) and a small grocery.   I had laid my rig up against the front wall of the food mart while I was in the bathroom around the corner.  After my trip to the bathroom, as I was rounding the corner, returning to my rig, I heard two men in their 60's looking over the bike.  One said to the other, "It's got everything on it, except a motor."  The other man laughed and replied, "Yeah, it needs a motor."  He then looked at me as I was approaching and then said, "Here come 'da motor right now." So, that is the quote of the day:  "Here come 'da motor right now."  And henceforth, I will refer to myself as "'da motor."      Today was an amazing day - my biggest daily mileage ever.  I think that is great but what amazes me more is the fact that I did it on the rig, with sore legs, and at such high rate of speed - the fastest of any day yet.  When I pulled into my friend's apartment, I was a little worried that maybe I had done too much, but the fact that I had a great appetite at dinner and that I slept soundly and for nine hours tells me that everything was okay.      I had a 54 mile morning, starting at 7:35am, cruising through southern Virginia and eating lunch in Clarksville.  I ate at Gino's Italian restaurant, and however cliche it may sound, I had the best Turkey and Ham sub of my life.  I lika the juice.  It was good.      In the morning I had also stopped at a small post office in Wytheville, Virginia to mail to New Orleans my Virginia Atlas, gloves and my long underwear top, all of which will be no longer needed in the South.  I can't say I felt two pounds lighter, but I think that over time my legs were happy to pay the $3.95 in postage.  The weather was cooperative - it never got very hot.     The day was otherwise uneventful.  I ate at a fruit stand where a moustached elderly lady was very sweet to me and thought it was cute that I was riding cross country.   My friend, Olivia, had a great pasta dinner waiting for me upon my arrival in Chapel Hill.  We all had a relaxing evening swapping stories of the past year since we last saw each other.  Later, Olivia had to study for her Accounting class, so I talked with Courtney and wrote in my journal before easily falling asleep.
I slept late Friday morning, did some laundry (showering with my clothes on isn't quite as effective as a good GE washer/dryer), and then took the S bus up the Chapel Hill.  I headed over to Carmichael Auditorium (former stomping grounds of MJ and MS [me]) in search of my track coach.  He wasn't in, but I did talk to the distance coach for awhile.  Strangely, he had heard about my bike trip (kinda cool).   Off to Lenoir Dining Hall where I had the decision of paying a la carte downstairs or paying $6.75 to go pig out upstairs.  Listening to my appetite (my legs were definitely in repair mode, so it was huge), I pigged out upstairs.  I sat down at my normal table, ate, and read The Daily Tarheel, just like I did when I was here.  It was all too strange but fun too. I headed over to Davis Library to get on the computers.  Now this joint holds an extra special place in my heart and strangely on my head.  This is the source of my many gray hairs.  They sprouted the spring of my senior year as I sat in a study carrel exactly seven floors above from where I am sitting now.  After my trip to Davis (I am typing this in on Saturday now), I checked back for Coach (he wasn't in) and then went to South Campus where Olivia picked me up after her class day.  We went over to Performance Bike, and I purchased some Clif Bars, Power Bars, another spare inner tube (a replacement for the one popped on day one), derailer cables (a spare item I should have brought with me in the first place), another Continental Ultra 2000 tire (it will be my new spare; threw out the one I took off on day one), and a big bottle of Endurox drink mix.  So, I am restocked and ready to go Sunday morning.  But, all of my work of culling down my load is negated by the eight pounds of stuff I just bought.  However, I think of it this way, most of that weight is food products that will be gone soon anyway, and I feel that as the trip goes on I will be holding on to just the stuff I really need.  I.e. I really need those derailer cables I just purchased, but I don't need the long underwear top, so I mailed it home.   Rolled around town and went to a social function with Olivia at a local restaurant where the students in the MAC program got together.  I talked to all of the former math teachers-turned-accountants.
  Accommodations:  Olivia & Courtney's Apartment Quote of the Day:  "I like poop -- I think it's funny." After I ate three bowls of Optimum cereal (14g of dietary fiber per bowl), Olivia and I got to talking about the power of fiber, and in the ensuing conversation she graciously blessed me with this wonderful QOTD. Slept late and then got a ride up to campus to fix all of the errors I made yesterday as I hurriedly entered my journals.   Because it is such a nice day out and my legs need to be loosened up a little bit, Olivia and I are going to go on a 25 mile jaunt around Jordan Lake.  She is quite the bike stud, so I hope she doesn't ditch me in rural NC.  I am going to strip the rig down and just have fun - not worrying about my stuff or my speed.  ----- Plans changed very quickly Saturday afternoon.  I had checked my email before I left the library here at UNC and noticed that my friend, Allen, had sent me a message saying that he would be in town during this weekend recruiting at a track meet at Duke.  Allen is the throws coach on the Track & Field team at Syracuse University and a good teammate and friend of mine from my track days at Carolina.   We got in touch and planned to meet with Kim, a mutual track friend and fifth year at UNC, for dinner.  But before that, Olivia took me on about a 20 mile stroll around Jordan Lake.  We went kinda fast , but it felt good on my legs and even better to ride with someone else.   Allen, Kim, and I had a great evening on the town - it felt, for a little bit, like I was back as a student here.   Allen is going to be in town for one more day, and I thought I would put off leaving town for one more day as well because this is such a chance rendezvous.   
Accommodations: Shared Holiday Inn Express hotel room    After waking up very late, I packed up my things and said goodbye to Olivia.  I headed back up Chapel Hill, this time with the rig.  I wanted to visit my friend Kim again, who would be working at the Student Rec Center (SRC).  The SRC also holds a special place in my heart, because that is where I used to sneak in my freshman and sophomore years when I was down in Chapel Hill visiting.  Many a squat workouts were performed there while I lifted under the guise of an everyday UNC student.          Anyway, I talked to Kim for awhile, and we got a stranger to snap a photo of us out front.  I headed back to the library for one last check of the email and update of this site.  Then I was back on the road.  I rode down to Franklin Street for some last minute reminiscing and then coasted back down the Hill, this time to the northeast (not towards New Orleans), towards Durham where my friend Allen was staying.  This side trip was out of the way, but I figured it was well worth it - I had allowed myself time in my schedule to do things like this.  The rig felt real heavy, maybe it was the extra stuff I was now carrying (from Performance Bike store), but it was probably because the day before I went riding without any gear and I was running on a little adrenaline trying to impress Olivia.    Allen and I went to dinner and then headed down to the brand-spanking-new indoor track that was built over the past two years to replace the decrepit "Tin Can" that we used to train in.  I had contributed some money ($$) over the past two years towards the program, so I was hoping that my name would be somewhere on the building's list of donors.  Well, we got there and the Eigth Wonder of the World was locked.  We couldn't believe it - for the first time in many years the facilities guys had actually locked up the track - they never did that for the tin can, well maybe that was why it was so decrepit.  So, I didn't get to see the plaque donning my name, but that's alright because, on second thought, I think you had to contribute ten thousand dollars while I gave more like ten dollars.  We had a good time, though, hanging out - I'll see Allen again in two months at his wedding.
Accommodations: Bill's Moto Inn Quote of the Day: "I have been sick to my stomach all day." Heard outside of Wendy's (after I ate there) as two employees conversed during a smoke-break.  Dave Thomas would not be proud of their professionalism.    Unfortunately, I have very little to say about today.  I had a lot of trouble getting the body going.  I have been getting enough sleep, but I think because it has been shifted a few hours back in the day, my body feels a little funny.  I'm not tired, just groggy. My atlases are great in the country, but are of little use in downtown areas.  So, to get out of Durham (the Holiday Inn Express was on the north end of town) I had to navigate using the compass to find my way southwest to my outlet road, NC Rte. 751.  I rode that for a while, a nice country road through tobacco fields.  I hit US Rte. 64 and headed due west for Siler City where I arrived in the middle afternoon.  At the first motel, the Heartland Inn, the only room available was the executive suite, which had a minibar and jacuzzi.  However tempting that was, I decided to stay across the street.  Anyway, who needs a jacuzzi when you have wood panelled walls and a 10 inch TV.
Accommdations: Eldorado Family Campground Quote of the Day: "Will Keep Children Call 625-1003" Seen written in magic marker on a piece of cardboard tethered to a mailbox somewhere on a backroad in the Uwharrie Mountains.  Does the FBI know about this service?  I am sincerely hoping that "keep," in this case, means baby-sit.    I hit the road in Siler City traveling due west on US 64 with Asheboro as my lunchtime destination.  From there I had planned on heading southwest on NC 49 which had a few campgrounds listed in my AAA book.  The 25-mile ride to Asheboro was no problem, but I was quite hungry on arrival.  I spotted a Food Lion grocery store and my mind was made up.  Grocery stores, I believe, are the perfect lunch stop, especially for a bike rider.  They have all that I need, plus AC and a clean restroom (an appreciated amenity).  So, I got my pre-wrapped sandwhich (the kind that comes in an isosceles triangular prism-shaped [I love geometry] box), some fruit, and chips.  Back outside, sitting on my rolled up sleeping pad, I enjoyed my lunch and said hello to the folks as they came and went from the store.   One middle-aged woman stopped and started up conversation.  She used to bicycle tour, and she pegged me quickly.  She was a native of Vienna, Virginia (crib!) who moved down to Asheboro and has loved the change of pace.  I grilled her on what my afternoon riding might bring me on NC 49.  She told me that the road runs through the Uwharrie Mountains, which are the oldest and therefore the most delicate mountains in the US.  We talked some more, but conversation drifted to what each of her six kids were up to (actually it wasn't that bad).  Later as she exited the store she wished me good luck again.  I watched her get in her 1970's white station wagon - kinda a cross between the one the Arnolds had in the Wonder Years and the boxy 1982 Grand Marquis, Juliette, my neighbor, had when we grew up (you know, the kind with simulated wood panelling on the inside).  She drove off, waving goodbye one last time. After eating I find it hard to jump right on the bike so I usually take that half-hour food-coma-time easy.  Olivia gave me a book as a present before I left Chapel Hill.  Briefly, the book, A Walk Across America, by Peter Jenkins is a story of a recent college graduate from Greenwich, Connecticut ($$$) as he walked across the USA in 1973 amidst all of the cultural and political chaos of the time.  It is an easy read, and I find it neat for a number of reasons, including a few things about it that are close to me:  Peter walked from the northeast to New Orleans; he walked down Route 193 outside of DC (the street on which I grew up); and he wrote the book at the New Orleans Baptist Seminary (a landmark along the railroad in Nola, and within a mile from Brother Martin High). I read about 15 pages and then found it was time to get scootin'.  Within a few miles on NC 49 I had been passed by about twenty trucks.  Trucks usually aren't a problem, but this road lacked a shoulder and the lanes were only average-sized.  I thought I'd stick it out because 49 is the only route to the southwest from Asheboro.  A few miles later, my heart skipped a beat as a pick-up truck laid on its horn as it passed me.  At first, I thought it was just some locals trying to scare me, but as the vehicle passed I noticed the CB antenna on the roof and the "Wide Load" banner across the bumper...quick assumption:  he was an escort vehicle.  I turned around and saw three houses, literally, barreling down on me.  I pulled off to the side of the road and let them pass.  After I caught my breath, I turned on the GPS to get my bearings and pulled out my map to find another way to go. Not too far down the road was Lassiter Mill Road which led to some other roads which eventually led to, according to my map, a campground.  Now this campground wasn't in my AAA book, but neither was the campground where I stayed on Day 2.  I made my turn to the left, southward, and passed tobacco drying barns and fields and fields of that leafy green cash crop.  As it does so often in the South in the summertime, around three, it started pouring.  With no other options, I pressed on for that unnamed campsite on Baden Lake.  After a while, my route took me on North Carolina State Route 1301 (nicknamed "Low Water Bridge Road") - it was all gravel and winded me through what seemed like a vast jungle of wilderness.  The road then sloped steeply downward as I picked up speed but kept my fingers on both brakes anxiously.  Two minutes of rocky descent led me to the Low Water Bridge.  I came to a halt about 60 meters above the bridge to see better what I was up against (and to snap a photo) - simply, it was a narrow concrete bridge like those that cross Scotts Run to the residences off Swinks Mill Road in McLean.  I saw that the way was clear, I let off the brakes and coasted the rest of the way down the hill, hoping to get up some speed for the inevitable horrendous climb that awaited me on the other side.  In the gravel, I made it, maybe 10 meters, up the other side.  So I shift all the way down and spun up the other side at 6mph.  The rain continued, but by this time the sun was peeking out at an angle above.  It was hot, rainy, muddy - I felt like I was fighting guerrillas in the tropical rain forests of Guatemala, but I loved it.  This was traveling.    I eventually made it out to the "main" road (I hadn't seen another car for two hours) and a few turns later I found my campground.  I don't know where to start with this experience...I'll try though.  It was seven p.m. when I saw a makeshift sign on the side of the road that read "Eldorado Family Campground."  Making the left turn, in the now just drizzle, I had my eyes peeled for an office, but all I saw by the sign was an old single-wide home that didn't look like it had been lived in during this decade.  I rode in low gear through the mud around the grounds, finding eight RV's (all trailers sans accompanying vehicles) and a bathhouse.  There was trash everywhere and two semis parked in a gravel parking lot nestled in the woods.  The bathhouse was the nicest edifice there - I leaned the rig against it, under the awning, and went walking - in search of humans.  I peeked in a room attached to the bathhouse that had a worn out sign on the front reading, "office."  Inside were two washers and dryers (circa 1970) and what appeared to be old tractor parts on the shelf.  Still no humans.  I walked back to the rig and debated my options:  stay here; ride 18 miles in the drizzle to Troy and hopefully find a motel; or ride 8 miles to the nearby National Park on Baden Lake that had, according to the AAA book:  only primitive sites, dump toilets only, no showers.  It was late, and I was tired, so I picked a site under some pine trees near a water faucet.  I set up camp quickly and then hit the shower, all the while looking for an occupant of one of the RV trailers. The campground had a screened-in-on-all-four-sides shed that had a full kitchen inside (inside used in the loosest sense of the word) - kinda nice.  I got some water boiling and had my second of two dehydrated meals, Teriyaki Turkey.  Inside the screened-in cage, I analyzed everything around me trying to get a sense of what the problem with this place was.  The cabinets were all labelled on the outside in very neat handwriting, with no misspellings on words like:  pots, pans, knives (that f to v thing can be difficult).  So, I took that as a plus, but the extremely neat handwriting was a little disturbing.  My mind was playing tricks on me.  After dinner, I went back to the tent to read for an hour.  Rain drops through pine trees can grow very large and make sounds similar to that of someone walking nearby.  But, after I realized that I was fine.  I fell to sleep with no problem because it was such a tiring day, but I kept "one eye open" throughout my sleep.  Still no humanoids spotted since the mid-afternoon.
Accommodations: Holiday Inn Express Quote of the Day, Runner-up: "Ed Smith Deer Processing" Seen on a sign in front of Ed's house.  This is a rarity for me, the urban-dweller. Quote of the Day: "Proclaim Your Southern Heritage, Call 1-800-MY SOUTH, Sons of the Confederacy" Seen on a billboard ten miles northeast of Albemarle.    Awoke with the sun.  Sleep was broken but good enough.  Around midnight I heard the winds come in and the temperature dropped, at least in my tent, a good ten degrees.  I knew that after the all-day rain yesterday, I had a nice cold front moving in with high pressure behind it (Thank you Dr. Konrad, UNC meteorology prof).  My bike was filthy and needed a lot of TLC, but I was not in the mood.  I did some minimal maintenance on it - I wanted to leave.  I broke camp quickly.  I made it through my visit there without seeing anyone and consequently not paying a cent.   My predictions about the weather were right.  The day was beautiful and my morale was lifted.  I cruised five miles in the dry, cool morning air to a general store in Eldorado where I got my "on-the-road" breakfast:  OJ (for Vitamin C), pound cake (for carbs), peanuts (for protein), and peanut butter crackers (for a good combo of each).  Yes, they are all high in fat, but nothing in a general store in the South isn't.   I was heading south on a main road in the mountains keeping an eye out for my right turn to the west, River Road (one of many River Roads in this country), when I passed by a house with an old man and his dog both sitting on the porch.  The dog was a pit bull mongrel (half pit bull, half super ugly).  Of course, when the pooch saw me he gave chase.  I was happy to have my first dog encounter witnessed by its owner, you know, in case there was a dispute about who started the whole thing.  The dog gave chase and I upshifted, got out of the saddle, and dusted the poor thing (Note to self:  I'm awesome).  However, in the confusion incurred by my little race, I missed my turn, and it wasn't noticed until I was a mile up a mountain (Note to self:  Amend previous note-to-self to now read:  I'm sometimes awesome).  I turned around and coasted back down to River Road - no biggie. Coming out of the mountain portion of the day, I found a general store.  They had gorpe (it's an acronym, if you know what it stands for please write it in my guestbook, but it has peanuts, m&m's, raisins, and other goodies), which is the all-time best bicycling food.  Enjoying my food on a picnic bench out front, I was interrogated by two nice kids and their father about my trip.  The little girl, about 8, asked questions about water & food, while the brother, about 12, asked about my GPS and the pedals on my bike.  I found their pattern of questioning to be interesting and the questions themselves quite intelligent, and because the father saw that I didn't mind talking to them, he allowed the questioning to go on for about ten minutes.  The father, himself, got into it too.  He wanted to know if I was documenting my travels on a website.  "Funny you should ask," I said, and then I proceeded to tell him about my site.  Hopefully you found it!   After that fun run-in I had the most difficult climb of the trip.  I crossed the Pee-Dee River (pronounced just like you think) and ascended out of its steep valley.  The climb didn't take more than twenty-five minutes but it was easily the steepest moderately-sustained climb I have had yet.  I pulled over a few times to catch my breath.  At one of my stops, I looked over my left shoulder and watched a tanker truck struggle up the hill.  It couldn't have been going faster than 15mph.  As it passed I waved and smiled to the driver, and he did the same for me with that "I know how you feel" look.   Ate for second day at Food Lion, this time in Albemarle.  Most people walk past as I sit on my rolled-up sleeping pad and make no eye contact.  I think those people are scared, not necessarily of me, but of something foreign to them.  Then there are those that smile, and sometimes say hi or start up a conversation.  Those people know - for they've got the Chi and they are happy to see that the Chi is visiting from the outside.  I smile back with a look that says, "Hey baby, I know where ya' comin' from." Traveling at a slow speed throughout the U.S. has allowed me to see all different types of police patrol cars.  I move through each county and state slow enough to catch a glimpse of them all.  Be it stateys, county or city PD, or sheriffs' departments, the officers have all waved to me; maybe because they are jealous of my journey but probably because they are just good guys.  I had my first run-in with law enforcement this afternoon and, not surprisingly, it was with one of those good guys.  I pulled off NC 24-27 to sit in the shade and rest during the hottest time of the day.  Along came a patrol car that pulled up beside me.  Out from his Carrabus County Sheriff's Department vehicle stepped a stout, bald officer in his mid-thirties.  He was shorter than me, so when I stood to make his acquaintance I positioned myself down in the shoulder ravine a bit so he would be able to talk down to me.  Officer C. E. Carlee simply said, "I was driving by, and I would be mad at myself if I hadn't stopped to see that you were alright."  My fret turned to appreciation as I explained that I was trying to stay cool.  We talked for about five minutes about my bike trip and his previous encounters with touring bicyclists (one of them, a female around 60 years old).  He was very caring for me and at the same time respectful of my journey and all that it entailed.  He wished me luck, and he went back to his vehicle as I did to mine. Pulling into Charlotte during rush hour was interesting but fun.  I have been here a few times before but only to UNC-C for track meets, so I had not seen the big skyline before. At the motel I did a load of laundry in the bath tub and fell asleep watching The Best UFO Evidence Caught on Tape Ever, Part II (apparently the first one wasn't convincing enough).
Accommodations: Executive Inn Quote of the Day, Second Runner-up: "Pinecrest Mobile Estates" Seen on a sign in front of a trailer park. Quote of the Day, First Runner-up: "Whoooooohooo!!!" A passer-by at a food mart in South Carolina in response to my declaration that my trip was 1200 miles long. Quote of the Day: "God be whitchuu!" After I had eaten my meal at McDonald's, I returned to the counter to order three Nestle's chocolate-chip cookies and a carton of milk for dessert.  Johnna, my lovely server, saw that I had a map in hand and asked...(what follows is a replication of the dialog and actions that took place leading up to the QOTD in that empty McDonald's in Chester, South Carolina at 8:40pm): Johnna:  Where are you traveling to? Matt:  New Orleans. Johnna:  Why are you passing by here? Matt:  I'm riding my bike. Johnna:  What kind of bike?  [she then leans over to pick a carton of milk out of the commercial frig that is at floor level] Matt:  A bicycle.   Johnna:  [Almost falls over and hits her head on the floor]  Here baby, let me get you another milk [and she does]...(to the entire work crew): Hey everyone!!  This boy is riding his bicycle from Washington, D.C. to New Orleans! MANAGER:  [Working the fryer, and then enter stage left]  God be whitchuu! Matt:  Thank you, ma'am.    I took my time getting ready this morning.  In fact, I barely got out of the hotel by the check-out time of noon.  I was tired, and I had a lot to do:  blow-dry my laundry, bathe my bike in the bath tub, and pack up everything.  Once on the road, my body didn't want to cooperate.  Again, getting out of an urban area with just my atlas proved to be difficult.  Around mile 8 or so my body starting warming to the fact that it would be a riding day, but just around then I got lost in a large residential area twice the size of the McLean Hamlet, rife with dead end streets.  I finally found my way out and saw a Harris Teeter grocery store, so I decided to take my lunch break even though I had only made it three miles south of Charlotte proper.   Across the state line, I instantly felt something new.  Maybe it was just because I was now way out of suburban Charlotte, but nonetheless, things were definitely different.  Kudzu appeared for the first time on the trip.  According to my railroading buddies in Alabama, kudzu was introduced from Japan in the late nineteenth century and railroads were leading pioneers in its use.  Kudzu shored up rights of way and kept other weeds around the track to a minimum.  It's too bad that the stuff is everywhere in the South, because in the winter time it looks like a hideous dead brown vine.  Great kudzu website here:   http://www.cptr.ua.edu/kudzu/. My goal was to stay in Rock Hill, South Carolina.  I thought that because it was one of the larger cities in the state and home to Winthrop University (a Division I school) it would have, at least, one motel.  Bad assumption.  I rolled through the entire town on the main drag, US 72, and saw no such hoped-for accommodations.  Winthrop is a nice looking school - it kind of reminded me of Franklin & Marshall College but a touch bigger.  Winthrop is the alma mater of Andrew McFalls (LHS '94) - I passed by the arena where he played bball and achieved multiple conference (I don't know which one) player-of-the-week awards. Leaving Rock Hill on US Rte. 72, I felt disheartened.  It was 6 pm and I was headed towards Chester, 18 miles away - and I wasn't even sure if I would find a motel there.  On the edge of town I stopped on the side of the road to eat a Clif bar, ingest a lot of water and prepare for an unanticipated ride to Chester.  Morale was low, but I hopped back on the saddle and started rolling down and out of the hill that is Rock Hill, South Carolina.  Within a mile I passed by a handsome new middle school with a large black and red electronic message board out front.  In stone above the board, the sign read, "West Saluda Middle School," and on the electronic sign below was displayed the school's QOTD and present weather conditions:  "'Without Stress, there is no progress.'  Temp:  88  Time: 6:16PM."  I wanted to stop and take a photo but I had used my last photo on a pic of the SC state line sign (I'm not even sure if that one took because when I snapped the photo the camera made a "hey I'm not sure if I got that one," sound) and my other roll of film was buried deep in my left saddle bag.  For one of the first times on this trip, I was under stress.  I wasn't worried - I wasn't freaking out - but I was under stress - and I decided to take advantage of it.  The 17 miles that followed may have been my best yet.  My now golden brown legs stroked the pedals efficiently and tirelessly.  I cruised into Chester in just over an hour, found my hotel, and was so excited about my ride, I just pedaled up to the office and while I was still on my bike, I opened the door with my right hand and asked, "Do you have any rooms?"  Seeing a positive nod, I dismounted the rig, ran inside and probably blew the lady away with my positive energy.   I showered and went to Mickey D's.  But before I was blessed with one of the funnier incidents of the trip (see above - at least to me it was funny), I sat in the restaurant and wrote in my journal:  It is now 8:30 here at McDonald's, and I have 38 hours to make it across the state (about 120 miles) to the Calhoun Falls, SC post office before it closes Saturday morning at 10:30am.  I'm beat, but I've got a few different battle options, most of which put me there at 10.  Another option, I may consider Saturday morning, is calling and pleading with the postmaster to leave the package on the front step or perhaps with a local merchant.  I hadn't mentioned this before, but before I left my parent's house in Virginia, I mailed myself c/o "General Delivery" a large package of trip goodies to Calhoun Falls, South Carolina.  I picked that city because it is a border city and I didn't want to hold on to atlases any longer than I had to.  Moreover, it was about mid-way on my trip, and also quite importantly, it was a city I'd pass through before heading into the twigs of central Georgia and southeast Alabama.  In the package I had assembled: Georgia Atlas Alabama Atlas 12 new CD's (more on that later) Power & Clif bars Two pounds of Endurox drink-mix powder I certainly could go on without most of things, but the atlases are a must.  I'm not crossing in to Georgia without that atlas.  It just happens that, unless I really haul tomorrow, Friday, I'll end up going through Calhoun Falls on a Saturday afternoon or Sunday when the post office is closed.  We'll see what happens. * John Donne
Accommodations: Ramada Inn Quote of the Day, Runner-Up: "My prayers are with you." At a food mart outside of Clinton, the clerk asked me about my trip, and after I went through the story with her, she simply asked, "What's your name?"  I responded, and then she blessed me with this QOTDRU.  I have found that many people want to know my name.  I can only hope that they want to know it for the same reason as this nice lady did. Quote of the Day: "Welcome to Whitmire, Pearl of the Piedmont." A warm-hearted middle-aged woman started conversation with me at a foodmart as I was leaving Whitmire.  She was very interested to hear about all of the places I have been to, so she jokingly chimed in with this QOTD.    After an enthusiastic ride yesterday, it was hard to wake up this morning.  I eventually pulled myself out of bed and went to the lobby of the Executive Inn for their "continental breakfast."  I found that continental breakfast has varying meanings across this great land of ours.  Here in Chester, it meant OJ and a cinnamon roll no more than two inches in diameter.  I gobbled that down and headed back to McDonald's because the Executive Inn breakfast just wouldn't cut it for this calorie-burning machine.  As I walked over to McDonald's, I thought to myself what this day had in store:  about 90-120 miles of riding to put me in position to pick up the package at the post office in Calhoun Falls by 10:30 tomorrow morning.  At first, I was daunted by the task ahead of me - I was quite tired.  But walking through the grass that separated the McDonald's from the adjacent bank, I instantly caught that morning grass smell.  That smell always wakes me up.  It is the smell of a new day and new possibilities.  I told myself that I could do it.    My morning ride was uneventful:  30 miles to Whitmire.  I spotted a Piggly Wiggly supermarket on the way into town and decided it was time for lunch.  This place was perfect, it had a bench out front so I wouldn't have to sit on my rolled-up sleeping pad as I ate.  I leaned the rig up against the wall and sat on the bench to stop my sweating so when I went in the inevitably cold store I wouldn't catch pneumonia.  Not long thereafter, a beat-up early 1980's Ford Ranger-type pick-up pulled into the parking lot with an old, grizzled driver.  He parked the vehicle and waddled his way up to the bench.  He sat on one end of the bench-built-for-three, and I sat on the other.  It was an eerie silence for a few minutes as we both sat, but as I got up and prepared to go into the store, I said, "hello," and he returned the favor.  Back outside, ten minutes later, he still sat there.  I wondered, "Does he ever actually go shopping?"  I don't remember who started it, but we got a little small-talk going until he decided to finally get up and go inside the Piggly Wiggly.  Upon his return, with two pouches of chewing tobacco, he sat back down.  I decided to try a little harder:  use the map trick.  I pulled out my map and he instantly scooted over towards me.  Words flowed from his mouth like water:  what kind of hills were where, what the best backroads were, where I could find a place to camp, etc.  His description of the surrounding area was interrupted every minute or so by him standing up taking a pace forward and giving a power spit (he was a pro - a good eight to ten feet) into the parking lot.  At first I was thrown off by this action, because I would be talking to him and he just stood right up and walked away from me, but once I realized what he was up to, I understood.  Anyway, he imparted quite a bit of knowledge of the area on me that afternoon, most of which I found to be true as I actually experienced the area.  We said our goodbyes, and he headed back to his truck. After he left, I pulled out my book for some afternoon reading and relaxing.  The more I sat, the worse I felt.  There was no way I could handle another 60 to 90 miles today.  The positive vibes I had in the morning had clashed with the reality of my exhaustion.  I reviewed my options again in the atlas and decided to stop short of my goal and settle on Clinton, about 20 miles away - and hopefully find a motel.      However, once I got going, I found (like I usually do) that I felt fine.  But, I think it was a smart decision to stop in Clinton.  I'll call the post office in the morning and see if they can leave the package for me somewhere, and if not, maybe take an extra rest day before getting my package Monday morning.  In Clinton, I did a load of laundry, this time in an actual washing machine with laundry detergent, at the hotel.  Otherwise, I took it very easy and enjoyed the air conditioning.
Accommodations: Calhoun Falls State Park campground Quote of the Day, Runner Up: "Adopt-A-Highway Litter Control Program:  S.C. Parole and Probation" Seen on a roadsign.  Luckily, today was not clean-up day. Quote of the Day: "Do you want it all the way?" Let me explain - what follows is the dialog between me and a female employee at Snake's burger place in Calhoun Falls: Employee:  What would you like? Matt:  Yeah, I'll have the Hamburger plate. Employee:  Do you want it all the way? Matt:  Excuse me??? Employee:  Do YOU want it all the way? Matt:  Do you mean fully dressed??? Employee:  Yeah... Matt:  No, I don't want it all the way, just part of the way - with ketchup.    First thing this morning I called the Calhoun Falls post office to ask them about my package.  I knew that I wouldn't make the 65 miles by their closing time, 10:30.  The clerk I talked to acknowledged that my package was there waiting for me.  I gently coaxed her into helping me out of my quandary.  I told her about my trip and that I would like to get my package but not wait until Monday to do it.  I asked her if she could leave it with a local merchant and after a few ahh's she agreed.  She told me it would be waiting at the Amoco station across the street from the post office.  I then checked out and made the three mile jaunt from my motel off the interstate into the actual town of Clinton where the post office and public library were.  I mailed home a few more items, including my South Carolina Atlas (my route from Clinton to Calhoun Falls was direct) and a case of 12 CD's (12 different ones would be waiting for me in Calhoun Falls), totalling a little over two pounds.  At the library I quickly checked my email and typed in a few of my journal pages.  I had to move quickly because of overcast skies and what looked like impending rain.   I ate across the street from the library at a service station.  Around noon the fire siren went off.  This one, like the one in Fort Montgomery, New York, is pneumatic and takes a while to warm up, but once it does there is no hiding from it.  The fire house was located adjacent to the library and therefore across the street from me where I was sitting on the curb of the gas station.  The alarm got so loud that customers pumping gas got in their cars and rolled up the windows or ran inside.  Hearing the siren gives me a good reminiscing feeling of Fort Montgomery.  But, the good feelings the siren evokes are quickly diminished by the fact that it is near deafening.  It makes me wonder:  wouldn't pagers be better???  Instead of having a siren at the top of a pole they could have an antenna, and they could let technology do the work of what brute force currently does.  I ran back inside to use the restroom before I hit the road - the store was all abuzz with talk of the siren - I overheard the cashier say that it is the fire station's weekly Saturday noon test.  Lucky her. The ride to Calhoun Falls was entirely in the afternoon which made me worry.  I usually like to knock out a substantial amount of a day's ride before lunch when it is cooler.  Fortunately, today wasn't all that hot and the ride went real well.      The miles came easy and before I knew it I was in downtown Calhoun Falls where I easily found the Amoco station.  As I leaned the rig up against the front of the building, I looked inside and could see the cashier immediately reach under the counter for my package - I guess that they don't get many cross-country cyclists there.      Now very heavy, I headed two miles north of town to the state park, on man-made Richard B. Russel Lake.  After I pitched the tent and went through the daily necessaries, I threw on the tevas and went for a calm, cool, peaceful swim.  The water was murky but very refreshing.    After a shower, I got on the bike and rode out of the park and to Snake's, a highly-recommended (by the Amoco folks) burger place/gas station.  I ate my greasy dinner on the bench outside as the sun went down.  I felt good after a very productive day, and I found myself excited to get back to the tent to read my book.
Accommodations: Travelodge Quote of the Day: "Ain'tcha a little wet?" Heard at a red light in rainy Athens.  I knew instantly that I had a QOTD on my hands, so I glanced a peek over my left shoulder and noticed a group of Georgia peaches in a Ford Explorer.  The author had her back-seat window down and when she smiled her braces glistened under the sunlight that was trying to peek through the clouds - this young peach needed a little more time on the windowsill.    I crossed Richard B. Russel Lake into Georgia during the fourth and fifth miles of the day.  Although state lines, as far as I am concerned on this trip, are just political boundaries with no real implications except different sales taxes, it still felt good to move from one state to another.  I know that I can't make it to Louisiana without first going through a slew of other states, so with the crossing into Georgia, I am one step closer to my goal.    On my morning ride I passed a huge (I counted 45) group of motorcycle riders out for a Sunday spin.  The encounter was a little mysterious.  Many of the riders were wearing orange shorts that said, "Cycleworld of..."  I couldn't see where they were from, because their guts overhung the word after "of."  Perhaps they were going out on a dealer-sponsored ride.  Even more strange was that there were three vans (an equivalent of sag wagons for motorcyclists?) and a hearse following the riders.  Ohh well, all of the guys paid no mind to me, but I got a few, "whoo hoo"'s from the lady passengers.   Shortly after the sign welcoming me to Georgia, I had also noticed a sign welcoming me to Elbert County, which was the self-proclaimed "Granite Capital of the World."  I had always thought that that was New Hampshire's claim to fame.  I ate at a Winn Dixie in Elberton (not surprisingly, the county seat) where I, as usual, leaned my bike up against the front of the building and relaxed for a few minutes before I headed into the chilly grocery store.  I noticed that fire lane enforcement was not high on the Elberton PD's list of things to do.  There were at least six cars parked in the fire line simply because it was close to the entrance and it was in the shade created by the building.   After I purchased my lunch I took a seat on a bench in the antechamber of the grocery store - it was perfect temperature.  I said hello to folks as they entered in the store and most said hello back with no apprehension, despite the fact that I was in my cycling apparel and they in their going-to-church-finest.  Two teenage male employees approached me on their way back in the store from corraling buggies in the parking lot.  I have to give them credit for initiating the conversation, but I felt that they needed to expand their adjective database beyond, "cool."  Soon, we ran out of things to talk about, and I continued to break eye contact with them, hoping that they'd understand that I just wanted to read my book in peace.  After a few more minutes of discomfort, they got back to work.   In Elberton, I noticed quite a few gravestone stores, and I passed by the Elberton Granite Museum.  But, unfortunately, like the Sistene Chapel, it was closed on Sundays.  Outside of town I had another memorable dog encounter...  Minding my own business, I was cruising along U.S. Route 72, when I looked up and saw a young girl (about 10 years old) riding an ATV just off the other side of the road.  She, also, seemed to be having a good time on her Sunday spin.  Well, running at her side was a golden retriever.  The dog, upon spotting me, quickly lost interest in his mistress, and made a B-line towards me.  (Football players pay attention!) Luckily, the dog was a poor geometer, as his pursuit angle was horrible.  He didn't account for my swift closing speed and flew passed me at about four feet from my left knee.  By the time he slammed on the brakes and reversed, it was too late, I had put plenty of distance between us. Shortly after my dog encounter, the sky quickly darkened, and I was hit with a fierce head wind and a drop of about ten degrees.  Knowing that I had a short time to find shelter before the thunderstorm hit, I pressed on looking for a bridge for refuge.  Fortunately, I didn't have to go far.  After an hour wait under an overpass, I hopped back on the bike and continued westward under overcast but now quiet skies.  Ten miles later, the rains came again, this time with no thunder, but because I was in no hurry and I had found great shelter, I stopped.  I was in Carlton, Georgia (photo below), which was nothing more than a beautiful post office and five abandoned store fronts.  The 'strip mall' did, however, have a rickety but charismatic aluminum awning, which was a perfect place to set up for awhile.  I leaned the bike against a store window and sat down on my rolled up sleeping pad.  I read my book while the rain tapped against the ceiling above.  It reminded me of when I was five, and I would color in my coloring books on the front stoop of my parents' house during rain storms.  I felt then, as I did today, special to be outside during a storm but safe from its ill effects.    Eventually, the rain dwindled to a drizzle, and I decided to make my final press towards Athens, where my cousin Jenny attended school a few years back.  In town, I checked in, did my laundry in the bathroom sink, and went in search of Sunshine Cycles, a bike store I found in the Yellow Pages.  Fortunately, it was close and looked to be a reputable place.  I decided that is where I would take my bike in for service tomorrow.  The bike store was directly across the street form the 40 Watt, a famous nightclub where R.E.M. and the B52's used to perform back when they were young musicians with a lot of talent and little exposure.  I did some more exploring through downtown Athens, which seemed to be a great mix of the quaintness of downtown Chapel Hill and the hilly contours of the UAB area of Birmingham.  I certainly liked Athens - I just wished Jenny was here to give me a more in-depth and personal tour.  I ate at the Broad Street Bar and Grill where the requisite red and black memorabilia adorned the walls.
Accommodations: Holiday Inn Express Sunshine Cycles opened at ten, so I slept in a little and took my time getting ready.  On the way to the bike store I noticed my speedometer malfunctioning - giving me a speed reading of zero when I knew that I was going 15 or 20.  I debated shelling out 30 bucks at the bike store for a new one, but I decided to hold off - maybe the problem could be fixed with some MacGyver work.  And anyway, this trip was more than just a number on my odometer.   At the bike store, I explained my situation to the mechanic, telling him that I was traveling cross country and I just needed some drive train and brake tuning.  He said that he was booked with repairs until Wednesday (two days from now).  But, after some mild pleading, a reemphasizing of the fact that I was just passing through town for a day and all I needed was a tune-up, he gave in.  I left all of my gear, except for my trusty journal, at the shop and headed to campus. I went straight to the library and tried not to stick out too much with my UNC track shirt on.  Apparently, no one cared, or probably they just didn't want to get near me because I stunk (despite the bathroom sink washing of my clothes).   I spent all morning and some of the afternoon at the library.  Around lunchtime, I got myself lost (on purpose) on the way to the student union.  It was a good chance to see the campus (beautiful!).  After lunch I went to the neighboring bookstore to look for postcards.  Now, I have been to at least ten college bookstores for whatever reasons over the past decade, and UGa is the only one that has a Clinique counter inside the store.  Not just that, but the girl with the painted face behind the counter works solely for Clinique (no asking her for the location of the postcards!). When I checked into Athens last night, I told myself that I might only be taking a half day rest - leaving in the mid-afternoon after I picked up my bike.  After lunch, however, my body was telling me to rest.  Because I seemed to be doing okay on my schedule timing, I decided to take a full day off.  After I picked up my bike (I tipped the mechanic five bucks for helping me out - he greatly appreciated it), I went motel shopping again - the Travelodge was booked, so I headed to the Holiday Inn Express.  I took advantage of the guest laundry in the basement and washed every textile good that I had with me (except for my nylon trail shorts and rain jacket - I can't be in the laundry room naked!).  After dinner I stopped by a natural food store where I purchased some GORPE (what does it stand for?!?) and other energy-supplying sundries.  Two more hours at the library, and then I was back at the motel sound asleep.  Athens has been good to me.
Accommodations: KOA Kampground    The Holiday Inn Express had a wonderful spread for their "Deluxe" continental breakfast, so I decided to indulge.  The big breakfast was a great welcome compared to the sparse ones of weeks past.  Before I left town, I ran an errand at a local formalwear shop where I got fitted for a tuxedo for my friend Allen's wedding.  It was only a mile ride from the motel to the store, but because it was 80 degrees and rainforest humid, I entered the shop quite sweaty.  The young women helped me out and refused my tip even though they deserved it for dealing with my b.o.  Adjacent to the formalwear shop was a barbershop.  It was still only mid-morning, so I stopped in and shed some of my deadweight (my fro). On my way out of town, I passed by an off-campus bookstore and noticed a poster advertising UGa Track and Field, much like the ones we had at Carolina.  On the poster was All-American shot putter Reese Hoffa.  Neat for me because he is a guy I competed against when I was at Carolina.  Let me rephrase that, he and I were in the same meet together.  And I would watch him throw in the finals long after I was finished for the day in the prelims.  Anyway, it was cool for me to see the poster because it kinda gave me a small world feeling - something that happens when you travel and you realize this world is much more interconnected than once thought. Yesterday I did plenty of walking and a tiny bit of riding, but relatively speaking, I didn't do much.  In just that short time, my body has slowed down.  The metabolism wasn't churning like usual.  I thought that would be a problem: jump-starting myself.  But, surprisingly, sometime in the early afternoon, after lunch, all gears were turning smoothly inside my body.  I was fully awake, and happy to be riding again.  The legs felt pretty good, and my fatigue level was moderately reduced from my day off in Athens. Besides my errands in the morning, the day had no out of the ordinary experiences.  The bike felt like it was supposed to, tuned.  I pumped the miles out easily and enjoyed the Central Georgian scenery.  I did, however, have another unpaved road to ride on outside of McDonough.  This one was different than other gravel roads, because its base surface was a soft Georgia clay that gave way easily.  I had difficulty navigating that road and at times had to walk the bike due to lack of traction.   McDonough also holds a special place in my heart.  It is home to the Norfolk Southern Railway training school.  My first year out of college I spent a total of six weeks there learning to be a railroad conductor and later a railroad engineer.  In McDonough, I know where all three Waffle Houses are, I know where the best BBQ joint is, and I know where there is a great running trail (where I used to spend my days after class reviewing in my mind a locomotive's air brake system as I jogged around).  This time in McDonough I picked up a sub for dinner at Blimpie and then pedaled over to the campground.  I figured there was no need to go exploring down by the school, but it was neat for me to know that it was nearby (the locomotive horns in the distance reminded me of that fact).   The two elderly couples that worked the front desk at the KOA were blown away when I told them that I was bicycling across country.  They asked if I had a Harley Davidson or a Honda, and I reassured them that my vehicle make was a Cannondale (with a two-cylinder super-charged engine).  I was even followed out the door by one of the guys, because he didn't believe me.  To say the least, I stuck out big time at the KOA.  I was the only tent camper amongst 70 RV's.  Everyone gave me the eye, as I rode past them, while they sat in their lawn chairs in front of their mammoth mobile edifices.  The KOA "security" (two overweight old guys in a golf cart) kept an eye on me throughout the evening.  I understand their feelings - what is a single male doing on his bicycle riding across the US??? - he must be crazy.  Exactly.  And that is fine with me.  I just smile and wave at everyone I see.  Maybe people will realize it's not so crazy after all.  It's just different.   So, I ate my sub at my designated picnic table there in McDonough, Georgia.  The roar of I-75 could be heard nearby.  This place was less of a campground and more of an RV stop for Atlanta visitors.  Whatever it was, it served my purpose:  clean showers, potable water, and a place where I could lie my head down and feel safe. Tomorrow I must start doing what I have been putting off for awhile:  crossing the Appalachians.  When I was stationed in Birmingham working for the railroad, I often went on day trips for work through eastern Alabama and western Georgia.  I remember being surprised at the size of the mountains there.  Nothing huge (about 1500 feet), but plenty more than I expected for being at the southern edge of the chain.  I am a little nervous for the challenge ahead, but I think I'm ready for it.
Accommodations: Ramsey RV Park Quote of the Day: "I like people." Robert Lovett - read today's entry for the complete context of this QOTD.    It wasn't exactly cool out this morning, but it certainly was cooler than normal.  As usual, it took me two hours to eat breakfast, work on my bike, and break camp, so by the time I got moving it was 9:00.  The air still felt nice.  There was humidity, but instead of it being oppressive, it was refreshing.  My morning ride was excellent, in fact it was going so well that after seeing a sign for a public library in Hampton, I was tempted to just continue on.  But, I thought I should stop.  It has seemed like public libraries are hard to come by, and because I won't be passing through any major metro areas for a while, I figured I'd take advantage of the opportunity. I spent an hour at the library, just enough time to check my email and type in and proofread a day's entry.  At this pace, I won't be able to stay current with my website, but that's okay, because it is more important to do it right than to hurry it and end up doing it half-ass.      I ate at a Winn Dixie in Griffin.  After my standard triangle sandwich, chips, melon, yogurt, and a banana I sat and wrote the postcards that I purchased in Athens two days earlier.  The afternoon ride was uneventful but very enjoyable.  I rode quickly through the afternoon heat like it didn't bother me.  By three-thirty I was at a gas station in Woodbury buying a gallon of spring water for 99 cents.  That's when things changed... I gulped my water down and was headed out of the parking lot for my last eight miles of the day when I heard three deliberate honks of a horn coming from behind me.  I could tell the honks were for me because there wasn't much traffic around at the time.  I looked back and a man in his pick-up truck was gesturing for me to stop.  I thought he maybe saw that I had a flat tire, so I looked down and saw nothing; I thought he maybe saw that I left something behind at the gas station, so I looked back at where my rig earlier rested and saw nothing.  He pulled his small dark-bluish-purple pick-up next to my right side and started asking me about my trip -- the standard questions:  "Where are ya going?" - "How long ya been ridin'?" - "Where did ya leave from?"  He was in his 60's, in good health, and with a dark single-tone tattoo on his left forearm.  He had a juicy central Georgian accent and had no hesitation in his line of questioning or in his storytelling.  He'd ask me about my riding:  how the trucks are treating me on the roads, where I'm sleeping at night, and how does it feel to ride alone.  He told me of other cross country riders he has met in Woodbury, a Swedish couple that was riding truly cross country in a U-shaped route passing through Georgia early in their trip.  He beamed when he told me about a young man that he met while on a business trip in a Georgian beach town, who was canoeing around the eastern half of the U.S.  We talked for a total of ten minutes.  At the end of the conversation I gave him my website address, and he gave me his business card.  Robert Lovett was my acquaintance's name.  We said good-byes, and I left Woodbury with a smile. On my wonderful eight-mile ride from Woodbury southwest to Warm Springs, I thought to myself, "I'm going to see him again."  Something about Robert was different than other people I have talked to, even those that I have held extended conversations with.  He had a solid character and was fully engaged with my trip.  I told him before I left that I was heading towards Warm Springs, and he recommended the campsite that I was already planning on, one just outside of town.  So, I knew that he knew where I was headed.   Without much surprise, about a half-mile from the campsite a pick-up sped ahead of me, pulled over, and out stood Robert flagging me down.  I slowed in anticipation of what he had to say.  He told me of a friend, Mr. Bill, an avid bicycle rider, who lives on nearby Pine Mountain.  Robert said he had called Mr. Bill, and he would like to meet me.  Robert added, "Now, I know you have met a lot of weird people on this trip, but I'm not one of them.  I just think it is great that you are riding across the country."  Robert said he'd be back at 6:30 to take me around Warm Springs and then up Pine Mountain to meet Mr. Bill.  I believed that Robert was being honest with me, and without hesitation I told him I would love to go.   But first, Robert sped ahead again to the RV park.  When I showed up a minute later I found Robert in the office shooting the breeze with Mr. Ramsey.  I later learned that Robert knows the Ramseys well because Mrs. Ramsey is the mayor of Warm Springs and Robert, in his line of work, has a lot of dealings with her.   The charge to stay for the evening was ten dollars.  I parted with Robert again, and we reaffirmed our date time of 6:30.  This park was interesting to me.  Again, I was the only tent camper, in fact, I would say that I was the only camper.  The RV's that were there belonged to families that actually lived there.  The husbands came home from work throughout the early evening as I set up camp.  And the kids played wiffle ball on a green by the pool.  My accommodations were simple:  sleep on the lawn next to the Ramseys' two-floor aluminum-siding home and use the pool's bathhouse.   I later wondered why Robert just didn't part with me when we first set our meeting time of 6:30.  Instead he drove to the RV park not just to talk to Mr. Ramsey but to herald my arrival and to ensure that they had a place for me to stay.  It seems that in the countryside of the U.S. people know customer service and hospitality better than anywhere else. After I showered, I sat waiting for Robert on a shaded picnic bench near the Ramsey home.  Robert showed up on time and stepped out of his car bearing gifts.  He first handed me a new baseball cap that said, "Georgia Rural Water Association."  (he had told me earlier that in addition to managing water systems for Woodbury and Warm Springs he is the president of that statewide association) and a book titled, Miles From Nowhere.  According to him the book was written by a woman who has toured the U.S. extensively on bicycle - the stories she tells inspire Robert to take off and ride.  I thanked him for the hat and told him that I could get the book on my own.  There was no need for him to give me his only copy, especially when I am in the thick of reading another book right now.  He also told me he would have brought me some of the wine he makes on his property in Woodbury but was afraid that there wouldn't be a way for me to carry the bottle (true). We both sat down at the picnic table, and he told me that Mr. Bill was expecting us at 7:30, so in the meantime he had some memorabilia to show me and then he was going to drive me around Warm Springs (where FDR died).  Robert had a packet of photos, maps, and emails he had collected over the past few years in his visits with the Swedish couple that passed through Woodbury and Nat Stone, the guy that was canoeing around the eastern U.S.  As he opened up his manila folder of goodies he looked me square in the eye and said, "I like people.  I think it is great that you are biking across the country.  This country was built by people like you."  I was very flattered by his high impression of me.  We sat for about ten minutes, and he went through every photo he had of his previous encounters.   We hopped in his pick-up and headed into Warm Springs where Robert gave me a short but extensive tour of the town.  I got a lot of the history on FDR's connection with the area, the technicalities of the springs themselves, and Robert talked about his family too.  I could tell he was enjoying taking me around - and I too was enjoying listening and asking questions.  In fact he even told me, "I just enjoy showing you around.  It is fun to tell people about where you're from."   As Robert drove me up Pine Mountain he reminded me that I will be doing the same climb tomorrow on my bike.  And hearing his engine struggle up the slope, I got worried that my engine would be doing the same tomorrow morning.  He threw in a little story of when he was younger and went for a bike ride with a young lady up this mountain.  He said he was having trouble making it up the hill and he desperately wanted to get off the bike and walk it for a while because he could barely turn the cranks.  But, he joked, "If she wasn't going to stop, I sure wasn't going to get off the bike and embarrass myself."  So he said he struggled up the mountain, trying to hide his grimacing.   Mr. Bill and his wife own a log-cabin antique shop where they work during the day.  And recessed down a 100 foot driveway was their home (I later learned that they owned another home in Hampton and spent most of their time there - coincidentally, I was in Hampton earlier today checking my email).  When we pulled up to the log-cabin shop, Mr. Bill (that's what Robert calls him, maybe because he's Robert's senior) was out front preparing his small (I might add though, it was a perfect size) RV for roadside sale.  I stepped out of Robert's pick-up and Mr. Bill greeted me with a big smile.  This man had a huge aura surrounding him.  He was at least 6'3", in his early 70's, and in great shape.  His legs were muscular, his hand shake firm, but what I noticed most was his very cheerful laugh.  We exchanged greetings and headed down the short driveway to his home.  I instantly felt comfortable.      Mr. Bill's wife fixed us some cokes and we sat out on his side porch.  For about an hour, Robert, Mr. Bill, and I talked about bicycling, family, railroading - anything.  About twenty years earlier when Mr. Bill retired, he purchased himself a retirement present - a guided bicycle tour on the dirt roads from Montana to Alaska.  I, of course, was enthralled with any story he had to tell of his journey.  He also told me about bicycling the C&O Canal towpath recently - all 186 miles from Cumberland, Maryland to Washington, D.C.  Since I know a third of that course quite well we exchanged some stories.        It was my favorite time of the day, the hour before sunset.  The time when the sun creates subdued colors and the air has calmed down from a long day of heating and rising.  I think I smiled for the entire time I was there.  I was amazed by these older fellas' comfort with me, someone just a fraction of their age.  Never did they call me nave or joke about my inexperience in life.  I was equally amazed by these guys' physical condition and comportment.  Robert was very polite and interested in everything anyone had to say, and Mr. Bill was in such great shape and his childish but throaty laugh made him a pleasure to be around.   At the end of the hour, Mr. Bill's wife showed us around the inside of their home, we snapped some photos, and Robert and I were on our way back to the pick-up.  Before we left, Mr. Bill invited me back - he said next time I'm passing through town just give him some advance notice and they'll fix me dinner and let me stay the night.          There was nowhere to eat in Warm Springs to my liking, so Robert brought me to the BP station where I scrounged for dinner while he waited in the truck.  On the way to the campsite we talked about my route to New Orleans from Warm Springs, and I told him that I was nervous to head through the backwoods of Alabama where I will be as alone as ever.  Robert told me to call him if I ever needed any help.  He said he had colleagues in the Alabama Rural Water Association that would help me at the drop of a hat.  Back at the camp site, we said our good-byes and he snapped some photos of me with my bike in front of my tiny tent.        The trip, in my mind, has taken a new turn.  I think I had this encounter at the perfect time.  I am beginning to tire physically and more importantly, emotionally.  Although the riding has been good lately, I have found myself just wanting to get there.  In my conversations with Mr. Bill and especially Robert, I remembered that this trip is more than just getting to the destination.  Robert's enthusiasm about my travel made my enthusiasm multiply. For whatever reason, very few people do stuff like this.  I relish in the knowledge that I am a pioneer in my adventuring.  I sat in the dark at the picnic table at Ramsey's RV Park with my miner's lamp shining on my potato chips and chocolate milk, thinking to myself, "This changes everything."  Tomorrow will be more than just another day closer to New Orleans.
Accommodations: Howard Johnson Express Inn    My sleep was broken last night, but I was in bed for eight and a half hours so I felt fairly rested when I awoke.  I packed up and headed southwest towards Columbus, Georgia and its ugly kid brother across the Chattahoochee River, Phenix City, Alabama.  That would be only a 40-45 mile ride, but I thought that a shorter day would be good for my legs.  And anyway, the ride was going to have at least one big climb in it, Pine Mountain, so a 60-mile mountainous day was out of the question. I stopped by the post office I spotted the night before in Warm Springs as Robert toured me around town.  I mailed back to New Orleans a few things:  Georgia Atlas (except for the one page that I needed to make it to Alabama), the gift hat Robert gave me last night, my UNC hat (my hair is now short and no longer needs to be hidden in public when I take my helmet off), and my pair of long spandex pants (I bought these for any emergency where I found myself in cold weather, but I am now so far south the odds are against needing them).  The package weighed two pounds, but I thought that it was worth the stop and the postage because that would be two fewer pounds I would have to lift over Pine Mountain. The climb over Pine Mountain was rough, but don't get me wrong, it's nothing like any of the French Alps those studs devour.  Granted I am carrying a lot of weight, but those guys can climb for hours on end, this only took 20-25 minutes.  I threw the bike into granny gear and crawled up the hill at about 5 or 6 miles an hour.  I probably could have run faster up it, but then again, I am carrying my living-quarters and necessities.  The climb consisted of a long 8-10 percent grade followed by a short 12-15 percent grade.  I turned on the GPS/altimeter for the steeper portion of the climb just to see what kind of work I was doing.  I climbed that portion, 204 vertical feet, in under four minutes.      At what I thought was the top, the road flattened for a little bit as I passed by Mr. Bill's shop and home.  I then had some rises and falls in the road, with more ascent than descent.  I finally reached the top when I saw nothing but downhill ahead.  I was 1204 feet above sea level.  Georgia isn't known for its tall mountains, but in my book, it was the highest I've ever been on my bike.      It's really hard to describe the descent.  And statistically-speaking I can't portray it easily either.  My speedometer on my cyclocomputer failed for the entire descent and the speedometer on my GPS was giving me funny readings.  But I was getting what seemed to be accurate readings from the altimeter:  a descent of 460 vertical feet per minute maintained for 40 seconds - the ears were a poppin'.  I was disappointed that the cyclocomputer speedometer wasn't working, and when I got to the bottom of the mountain I checked out my GPS speedometer and it had registered a max speed of 88.5mph.  Now I know I was going fast because cars were having difficulty passing me, but I highly doubt that I was going that fast.  It was probably more around 50.  The GPS probably got some inaccurate readings because my head was directly above it (GPS picks up very weak satellite signals and any occlusion of line-of-sight to the sky decreases the unit's accuracy) as I tucked down into my Spaederdynamic stance. In Waverly Hall, Georgia at 11:00am I spotted Cooper's Grocery store and decided to stop and call it quits for the morning.  I had some Lunchables along with yogurt, a banana, and an apple.  As usual, I read my book after lunch and had short conversations with passers-by.  One fellow in a beat-up pick-up truck offered me a ride to Columbus, but I turned him down telling him that that would be cheating.   I encountered quite a few hills on my approach to Columbus from the northeast, and later I encountered a lot of traffic in downtown.  I wanted to stay in Alabama for the evening because although it is only a mile between Columbus and Phenix City, I would have another state under my belt.  Crossing into Alabama on a secondary bridge over the Chatahoochee, I was dismayed to see no sign welcoming me to the state.        I quickly learned that crossing into 'Bama for the evening may have been a mistake - I couldn't find a motel anywhere.  I should have remembered from my younger days as a railroader -- I did a lot of traveling out this way, and I always stayed in Columbus because lodging in Phenix City was so sparse.  After riding a few miles around town I crossed back into Georgia on another secondary bridge.  I headed south for US 280, the central artery in town.  I thought that I would definitely find something off that road, either in Columbus or Phenix City.  Intersecting 280 I looked west towards Phenix City and noticed a billboard for a Holiday Inn Express in Phenix City off 280  (2 miles away).  I saw nothing so promising towards the east, so I hopped on my bike and crossed the Chatahoochee for the third time of the day.  This time I got a nice state line sign.  I thought, "I'll  be in Bamy for a while,"      I ended up staying at the Howard Johnson's adjacent to the Holiday Inn Express for no other reason than that it looked to be cheaper.  I went to my room, a little aggravated by the heat, and a little frustrated that my short day was five miles longer than it needed to be as I hopped from Georgia to Alabama, back to Georgia, and then back to Alabama.   After cooling off and resting I ventured out on to 280 on foot and walked a mile westward towards some restaurants.  I ate at the nicest Italian place in town - a huge plate of spaghetti w/ meat sauce and a salad for seven bucks.  Perfect.  My frustration was quelled and my body replenished.
Accommodations: Blue Springs State Park campground Quote of the Day: 'I don't know where that is, but it sounds far away.' A passer-by at a grocery store in Eufaula in response to my declaration that I left on my trip from Washington, D.C.  An uneducated statement or profound political commentary???    I was on the road by 8:45 this morning headed due south.  I would be paralleling a railroad route towards a paper mill in Mahrt, Alabama.  I was familiar with this area of the state again from my railroading days.  The route was hilly and filled with trucks reeking of paper pulp (who thought something from a tree could be so nauseous).  But the shoulders were large and the scenery was beautiful.  I had a pleasant conversation with a farmer at a gas station somewhere along the way.  We both complained about the trucks, but we mostly talked about my trip.  Twenty minutes later he passed me in his late 80's Dodge Dakota and gave me a toot and a wave - that made me smile.  It was a 42-mile ride to Eufaula along the palisades of the Chatahoochee.   I pulled into town around noon and headed for the Winn-Dixie.  The conversation there blessed me with the QOTD.  Two elderly women stopped to talk with me as they were walking by.  They said they saw all of my bags on the bike and knew that I must be traveling.  I told them about the trip and they gave me the QOTD.  I was a little thrown off by them not knowing where our nation's capital is, but we continued to talk and I continued grinning in delight of their sweetness.  I closed the conversation as they were walking away by saying, 'Take care, ladies.'  They looked like they got weak in their knees.  One of them replied, 'Ohh, okay baby.'  I think they liked me.   I left Eufaula after some reading and resting.  It was hot - as hot as I have felt it yet.  Outside of town, climbing a hill, a blue sedan passed me and then pulled into a driveway and then the driver waved me over as I rode by.  I stopped and talked to the woman driver, about 40 years old.  Her septuagenarian mother sat silently in the passenger seat eating her Sonic french fries.  The woman wanted to wish me luck on my trip.  We chatted for about two minutes, and I told her that I was headed for Blue Springs State Park.  She beamed about the fact that the park was near her home (both of which were 15 miles away - apparently she and her mom went in to Eufaula for some fine lunch dining:  Sonic).  She told me about the park, mentioning that the word around Blue Springs was that there is now an alligator living in one of the ponds.  In Texasville, I took a left on to Barbour County Route 53.  For the next five miles I basked in the wonder that is Alabama.  CR 53 wasn't more than 15 feet wide and looked as if it hadn't been paved since its original surfacing decades ago.  The tarmac was a course aggregate that created significant resistance on my thin tires, but I glided through it all because I was in such a good mood.  I had U2 on the CD player blasting in my right ear and rhythm running through my legs.  The vegetation was lush and the houses that spotted the way were true homes, no trailers.  You trudge through a hundred miles for a few miles of pure pleasure like this.    I made it to Blue Springs buzzing.  The state park was only one or two hundred acres large, but the camp sites took up at least half that area.  I was one of two tent campers there, and there were a few other small RV's.  It was a Friday night and the camp was filled only to about 5% capacity.  I wondered if the place ever fills up.  The primitive site was $5.20 (state parks always charge an uneven amount - it's probably the state legislators setting strange taxes rates). I had plenty of places to choose from.  I looked for a site farthest away from the pond (away from the gator!), but none of those were flat.  I settled on a flat one in the shade that was still far enough away from any danger.  Today was an awesome day of riding, and heavy on miles too - my second biggest yet.  The endorphins still pumped through me for a full hour after I finished riding mostly because I stayed active in the heat as I set up camp.  I did, however, feel a deep-seated tiredness inside.  I can make it another day or two without rest, maybe three, but that'll be it.    After the daily evening chores, I sat to eat an energy bar before taking a shower and finding dinner.  I had purchased a cookies & creme Clif Bar at a service station earlier today.  This would be my first Clif Bar of that flavor.  I opened it up and noticed that it looked different than most Clifs - it looked to be made of sandlike grains adhered together around a central core.  I took a bite and after two chews I looked back at the bar for my next bite, only to see about twenty mite-like insects in the bar.  I spit out what I had in my mouth and immediately washed with water.  I suppose it could have been worse, I could have inhaled the whole thing without looking.  My body is pretty resilient at this point of the trip, and I don't think any of those insects will hurt me.  I took the remaining three quarters of the bar and got into the discus stance and hurled the infected bar into woods (Coach B would be proud of my knee-tuck). I listened to the National Weather Service on my weather radio as I ate a different energy bar.  Tropical Storm Barry is on its way towards Mobile, as was I.  I've made it this far, I'll just press on tomorrow and keep me ears peeled to the radio.  At this point of the trip I have to start thinking about how I'm going to cross the Mobile Bay.  I have four options:  Option A:  hitchhike over the bicycle-prohibited I10 bridge; Option B:  hitchhike through the tunnel on US 90; Option C:  Ride into Mobile then north 6 miles on Alt 90, cross the bay on a secondary bridge, and then ride south another 6 miles to get back on to US 90; Option D:  ride through the panhandle of Florida, along the Gulf and then cross the bay at its lip on a ferry.  Options A and B aren't out of the question, but I would rather not hitchhike.  From Blue Springs it is exactly equal distance for Options C and D, but D is more majestic, and I'm all about majesty.  Option C doesn't sound fun, D does.  I don't have to make the decision for another day and a half of riding, so I will wait to hear where Barry is going.  There are few campgrounds and even fewer towns large enough that look like they may support a motel here in this part of the country.  So, I must divert from my Chapel Hill to New Orleans straight-line path that I have been sticking to.  I have no option. For dinner I walked to the only business in Blue Springs, a BBQ restaurant.  And, however clich it may sound, I had the best pulled pork sanwhich I've ever had.  Added to that I had a baked potato, beans, a tall glass of Barq's, and a slice of pound cake for dessert.  Maybe food tastes better when you are camping, or maybe the best barbeque is in Blue Springs - really I don't care which statement is true, maybe they both are. When I checked into the Howard Johnson yesterday in Phenix City, I asked the clerk if I was in Central Time yet, and she told me that Phenix City for some reason stays on Eastern Time (my speculation:  Columbus, Georgia across the river is five times the size and the little brother wants to keep time with its elder).  She couldn't really tell me where Central Time starts, but I assumed that it was somewhere on the outskirts of town.  I never saw a sign today (I wish I had, I've never biked across a time zone before), but looking at the clock in the restaurant I realized that I have made the change.  I will be using the extra hour not to ride but to sleep. And so I did, at nine.  I fell peacefully to sleep under clear starry skies.  Today was good.
Stats: 4:34:44 ride time 13.2mph avg speed Accommodations:  Travel Inn Quote of the Day: 'Where you from again???  I gotta tell my buddies 'bout 'dis.' Closing comment from a convenience store conversation.    Last night's sleep was perfect.  The stars were out, the air was dry and cool, and I slept like a baby - for nine and a half hours.  I woke up this morning refreshed.  The legs were sore, but I had a lot of energy.  With a relaxed rhythm I ate breakfast, packed up, and quietly rolled out of the park.    I had an uneventful first 10 to 15 miles of the morning, but that didn't make it bad.  I cruised through the county roads, enjoying the warming sun.  This part of the U.S.A. seems to be full of rolling hills that can be steep at times but are not very long lasting like they have been earlier in the trip.  I am definitely in the Piedmont of the Southeast, and it won't be too long until I'll be at the Gulf of Mexico. Enjoying a nice downhill coast, sometime in the mid-morning, I didn't prepare myself for the inevitable bridge that lay at the bottom of one stream valley.  The bridge and the road were separated by almost two inches and the impact of the bridge lip on my rear tire was quite violent.  Not surprisingly, within two wheel revolutions of the impact, my rear tire hissed loudly.  After five seconds of cursing myself for letting this happen, I slowed the rig to a stop and leaned it up against a utility poll.  I think early in the trip, a few seconds of anger at myself would have progressed into many minutes if not a half-day or more of frustration.  But, I have matured in the past three weeks.  As long as I am safe and I have the tools to fix the problem, I don't get phased anymore by mechanical mishaps or anything else. My tubes, tire irons, and pressure gauge are not surprisingly kept at the very bottom of one of my panniers, so I took my sweet ole' time getting to them - unpacking everything on the shoulder of that Barbour County road.  I was humored by the location of my make-shift repair shop - this road was completely devoid of houses except for where I set up shop.  Midway through my repair job as I sweated through the tire-pumping process I looked up to the large window in the lone edifice on this road to see a middle-aged woman staring at me.  Immediately, she took her hands out of the horizontal blinds that she had propped open to sneak a peek at this crazyguyfixingabike.  I smiled and went back to working on the rig.  I did, however, think to myself, 'Lady!  Don't just sit there, a glass of ice-water would be nice.'   But, I moved on and found myself in Ariton, Alabama by 11:00.  I picked up some refreshments and the QOTD at the general store in town.  I asked the author for a mileage estimate to my lunch stop, New Brockton.  'Twelve miles,' he said, which is what I had predicted.  Perfect.  I rolled out of that one-caution-light-town and as I climbed a hefty hill on the outskirts  I heard an old pick-up chugging up the hill only slightly faster than I was.  I sensed the truck off my left knee, and I saw out of my peripheral vision that it was a 1950's Carolina Blue pick-up - my kind of truck.  I turned my head to get a better look at what was going on just two feet away.  In the cab were two enormous black guys, about my age.  I immediately pegged the passenger as a spitting-image of my college teammate, James Wagstaff (Note:  'Wags' was also a starting offensive tackle (340+ lbs.) on the football team and is now with the Miami Dolphins).   Nonetheless, these guys were intimidating merely by their size and the fact that they were only inches away.  They immediately quelled my anxiety with a simple remark from the driver, 'Hey friend, where ya comin' from?'  My stone face turned to a huge smile as I gladly exclaimed, 'Washington, D.C.'  A one minute conversation ensued as we moved at 8mph up a hill that gradually flattened towards the top.  Once I saw that they were creating a minor traffic jam behind them (three cars), I thanked them for saying hello and wished them a good day.  It is those chance encounters that are the essence of enjoyment for this trip.  Those guys didn't need to stop and say hello, but they did it anyway.  I also learned that a great way to get a positive response out of a stranger in an unsure situation is to open your conversation with a, 'Hey friend.'  Ohh, and the passenger after seeing my smile had the exact same smile as Wags does.     I ate lunch ate a Piggly Wiggly in New Brockton.  The grocery store had one cashier, one bag boy, and one manager, but a plentiful selection of food.  I declined the bag boy's offer to carry my groceries out to my car.  I sat outside on a long glossy wooden bench which was in great shape despite having only a small awning overhead for protection from the elements.  I took an extra long time today to eat and rest, partially because it was so hot and partially because I had already set my sights on Opp which was a meager 15 miles away.  In the lack of a rush I got to enjoy conversations with the proud store manager and one long-time resident who kept asking me if I was in a bicycle race.  I'm not sure if he ever got the idea that I was just riding across country for fun, but at least he made an effort at talking.  He also assured me that I would be able to find a motel or two in Opp, which was comforting because according to my weather radio, Tropical Storm Barry was only a day or two away. The temperature read 94 degrees at the local bank as I left New Brockton.  I felt fine though.  I took the first few miles out of town slowly, until my body was awakened and ready to pound out some miles.  And so I did.  Through quiet barren roads, I swiftly plodded - past a half-dozen Baptist churches and their accompanying picnic grounds and graveyards.  Properly reflecting their settings, the churches were aptly called such beautiful names like Mt. Olive.  I had U2 again playing in my ear, and before I knew it I was in the metropolis of Opp.  I had two choices for motels in town (like my acquaintance said I would).  I chose the Travel Inn merely because it was across the street from a service station where I stopped to purchase a Florida Map.      The cashier, a woman in her young 30's named Sassi, was floored at the revelation that I was riding my bicycle across country.  She told me to hang tight while she called the local news station.  After she waited on hold for a minute or two, I, wanting to get out of the freezing interior of the Chevron Food Mart, wrote down my name and where I was staying.  Sassi, was anything but, so I was hoping that she simply and only used that information for its intended purpose, a TV interview.   Outside the store I spotted an Alabama State Trooper pumping gas into his majestic blue and gray (mostly gray:  this is the South) Crown Vic.  I struck up a conversation with the statey, telling him about my journey.  My objective was to get advice on how to cross the Mobile Bay, a task that I'll have to encounter in the next two or three days.  He said he couldn't help me with my request because his jurisdiction was the southeast portion of the state, not all the way west to Mobile.  He was, however, inquisitive about my route up until Opp, so I shared a few sentences with him and then headed back to my rig. As I was getting my stuff together to walk the rig across the street to the motel to check in, I was accosted by a family from Paducah, Kentucky that was passing through town on their way back from the Gulf Coast beaches of Florida.  Both the son and daughter snapped photos of me, why I'm not sure.  The father jokingly said they wanted a picture of the bicyclist that made it almost all the way from D.C. to New Orleans before he was hit by a truck.  Yeah real funny    After a shower I gave the Alabama State Police in Mobile a phone call to pose to them the same question I posed to the trooper in person earlier.  It took a minute or two to make the operator understand what I was doing and that I really was on a bicycle.  But, after that she was very helpful.  We discussed each of my four potential Bay crossings.  Two were immediately out of the question for riding (but not for hitchhiking, if push came to shove), one because it was the interstate and one because it was a tunnel.  I was left with two options, a bridge crossing 16 miles out of the way to the north of Mobile or a ferry crossing at the lip of the Gulf of Mexico.  After some research (using my headphone cord as a measuring device on my map) I found that they were almost identical in mileage.  So the question was begged, a boring bridge crossing or a fun ferry ride?  The former was too drab, the latter was something novel and besides it would require me to go through Florida - and unplanned odyssey.  Florida it would be, now I just have to see what Mother Nature will do.   I walked to the Arby's for dinner and the IGA grocery store to pick up some Wheaties Energy Crunch cereal (very good) and milk for breakfast.  More Gary Condit coverage before bedtime 
Quote of the Day: 'C'mon man, let me in!'  Heard at my motel room door at 3:15am after a round of loud knocking.  Needless to say, I didn't comply. The storm that seemed imminent yesterday late afternoon didn't pass during the night.  In fact, according to The Weather Channel, it didn't look like it will be in downtown Opp until midnight tonight.  So, I could've conceivably headed out and done a good 40 miles of riding and then hunker down again, but my legs were so beat that they felt bruised.  And, I was fine where I was anyway - I had a grocery store across the street, a great book to read, and the most basic of cable TV to watch.  Relatively speaking, I was in paradise. I tracked the storm throughout the day in my journal: My location:    31.3N  86.3W 4am 27.8N  86.6W   Moving:  NNE @ 6MPH 8am 28.2N  86.4W   NNE @ 6MPH 1pm 28.6N  86.5W   N @ 6MPH 10pm 29.9N  86.2W  N @ 6MPH And later in the afternoon I wrote:  It is so odd to me that this trip which has been planned for months is now held up at its waning moments by an impending hurricane that is directly headed for my path.  Kinda frustrating, but I'll just wait - no hurry.  I have been busy this entire summer with my classes at UNO, my trip to Europe, and this bike trip.  I could be bumming around in New Orleans or here.  I would rather be there, but here is okay, so I'll just be super-rested for my last four days of riding. I went over to the IGA sometime around dusk to pick up dinner and some granola bars. I ran into Sassi (Chevron clerk) who was shopping with her girlfriends.  We exchanged 'hey''s (hers more southern than mine), but no mention was made of the TV interview that didn't come to fruition.  Despite the Alabamians lack of interest in a TV news story about my ride (I'm not sure, after all, why the interview didn't happen), as I walked back to the Travel Inn, I felt a renewed admiration for the state of Alabama.  There is something about the 'Heart of Dixie' (as it is so called on their license plates) that is special.  It is hard to explain in words, but I know I felt it when I lived in Birmingham, and I feel it again now.  And I feel it in Peter Jenkins' words as I read of his travels through this state.  Alabama:  its people, its land, its roads, its contours - has got something special about it.  Sometimes it is so colorful that it's full of character, and sometimes it is so devoid of charm that it strangely feels full of character.  Hard to articulate, but I'll leave it at this:  Alabama is juicy.  Now it's up to you to explore what I mean.   Back in the motel room I assembled a package to send home to New Orleans.  I got rid of a lot of stuff that I hopefully won't need over my last four days, including:  one pair of cycling shorts, one shirt, the cell phone charger, and a few tent stakes that hadn't been used yet. I lay in bed for most of the day and alternated between watching TV and reading my book.  One passage, in particular, inspired me for the next days' journey; Peter writes about leaving town after a period of rest  As always when I left a town with fluffy beds and instant food, it would take me all day to get my body and mind into flowing gear.  Flowing gear would make me move effortlessly while I looked, watched and listened. I hope the storm will pass tonight, so I can merrily be on my way - my last leg to New Orleans.  A few hours into the ride tomorrow, I'll be sure to kick it into flowing gear.
Accommodations: Holiday Inn Express Quote of the Day: 'Don't forget to put his cell number.'   That's cell, as in prison cell, not as in cell phone.  Overheard in the Opp post office between two women discussing their imprisoned husbands and the need to properly address letters to them.    I slept late and after breakfast I checked The Weather Channel.  Tropical Storm Barry had moved through Opp during the evening and was currently centered 25 miles southwest Selma - the forecast for Opp was partly cloudy skies, no precip.  I called the public library in town to see if it was open so I could update my site.  The elderly fellow on the other end said that the library was closed for the day because of the storm and that he was just in the library for a few moments to make sure that nothing was damaged.  How cute. I took my time getting my stuff together and heading out of the motel room.  I wasn't really in the mood to ride quite yet, but I knew that I had to put some mileage in.  After getting lost a few times in downtown Opp I found the post office (a new modern one) on the outskirts of town where I mailed a package of stuff to New Orleans.  My last errand in town was at a gas station food mart - where I picked up a triangle sandwich and chips.  Most likely lunch will be eaten on the road, because according to my map, my path into Florida went through no dots.         I headed out of town south on US 331.  There were few cars on the road but plenty of fallen branches from the storm the night before.  The wind blew hard out of the southeast and into the left side of my face.  The five or so miles on US 331 were a pain because I didn't really want to be riding (yet) and the wind slowed my pace to a meager 10MPH.  Fortunately, I made a right turn off of the main route and into Conecuh National Forest.  I now had the wind at my back.  For the next five hours, I would not see more than two people, one car, and two dogs  Somewhere in the northeast corner of the national forest, as I rode along an old paved road, I passed a house with two large yellow lab-like (but much bigger:  100lbs. each) dogs standing sentinel out front.  'No big deal,' I thought, I've encountered many dogs on this trip.  But these dogs were different:  they were bigger, faster, and apparently hungrier than any of those I've met before.  Going about 20MPH, I had each dog, fangs exposed, about a foot away from each of my ankles.  I rode hard for about ten seconds to see how intent they were on having me for a meal.  And although they never chomped down on me, they never slowed nor backed off from their locked-aim on my ankles.  So, like I have before, I pulled one of the cans of Halt! pepper spray off of my front handlebar bag.  But, because there was no shaking these guys with speed or shouts of, 'No!' I decided to unleash the pepper spray on these unsuspecting but nevertheless vicious canines.  They each got three seconds-worth of liquid in their eyes, first the dog on the right and then the dog on the left.  As I stood out of my saddle to put more umph into the rig's drivetrain and therefore separate from the predators, I glanced over my left shoulder to see the two dogs furiously rubbing their faces into the grass of the road shoulder.  'They'll get over it,' I told myself.  So, yes the Halt! does the job of saving people from dog attacks, but there is a caveat  Pepper spray irritates humans and canines - we all know this.  Obviously, it irritates eyes and mouths first simply because of their exposure, but it will also irritate skin - it just takes time.  I found this out the hard way.  Apparently, when I was spraying those blond marauders, I got quite a bit of spray on my fingers, legs, and water bottle (mounted on the down tube of the rig).  Recovering from the chase, I took a swig from my water bottle to only feel five seconds later not refreshed, but like I was sucking on twenty red-hots.  There wasn't much I could do but take hits from my Camelbak water and swish it around my mouth.  Meanwhile, during the ten minute latent period, I was unknowingly spreading the spray all (read:  ALL) over my body.  So just as I was getting over the red-hot predicament with my mouth, my body felt like it was frying.  Granted, it was noon and the temperature was in the high 80's, but it felt like I was in the high 200's.  It wasn't really painful but just very irritating.  I kept riding, trying to focus on something else to take my mind off the feeling that I was entering Dante's third ring of hell.  I eventually pulled over under a shade tree and went searching for my bar soap in my left saddle-bag.  And there in the middle of desolate southcentral Alabama, I took a very rudimentary shower:  taking water into my mouth from the Camelbak, spitting it into my cupped hands and rubbing the water and bar soap over my burning body.  I knew that time would be the biggest healer of this ailment.  I hopped back on the bike, only slightly relieved and pedaled on, just waiting for the heat to dissipate.  This feeling was certainly better than being mauled by dogs, but at the time, I had a hard time rationalizing that in my mind.  I was mostly just mad at myself for getting myself into this situation:  irritated by heat and now with less than half of the Camelbak water left as I entered the hottest time of the day.  I had learned my lesson though:  get the pepper spray exclusively on the canines not the human using it. The lack of water didn't prove troublesome until after lunch when I was deep into the forest on quicksand-like roads.  I was depending heavily on my compass, GPS, and atlas to navigate through the wiles of the unsigned, unpaved roads.  I knew that the town of Wing, Alabama was on southern end of the forest, on the Florida border.  Surely, there would be provisions there.  As I felt the weight on my back wither down, I knew I had to conserve energy and water (inside my body and out) to make it through this predicament.  My pace slowed, but I was sure that I would make it through this because I felt fine and felt no panic or hurry inside of me.  Fortunately, by this time (about two hours after the dog incident) the irritation had completely ceased.  I listened to a faint NPR signal and slowly revolved the cranks.  And anyway, in a pinch, I could purify water from one of the many streams in the forest.  But, it never came to that  Going southwest of Forest Road 14, while in the process of dismounting the rig to portage it over a fallen tree, I heard a motor vehicle in the distance behind me.  I waited for a few moments and saw a dark green Ford F-150 pull up.  'Ahh -- humans,' I thought.  The driver-side door read, 'Dept. of Agriculture United States Forest Service.' The 'Ahh -- humans,' turned into an, 'Alleluia -- humans!.'  I stopped the truck to ask if I really was on Forest Road 14.  In the ten minute ensuing conversation I learned a good bit about these guys' jobs (keeping the roads of the Conecuh clear for passage), why some National Forests have houses in them (they are residences that preexisted the creation of the National Forest), and how I was to make it to Wing (I really was on FR 14, headed the right way).  They offered me water out of the cooler they had in the bed of the truck.  They repeatedly apologized that the water was a little warm.  I assured them that I was not picky.  So, my Camelbak took on some water, and these bad-asses in Carhart apparal (they deserved to be wearing it) rode over the branch I dismounted for, and off into the distance.      I finally made it out of the Conecuh National Forest, and into downtown Wing - a service station.  I bought two gallons of water - ingested one in the parking lot, and stowed the second for the remaining haul of the day.  Before I left Wing, I called home and talked to my dad assuring him that Tropical Storm Barry was no threat and that I would be in Florida in minutes.  The plan, at the time, was to stay at a campsite fifteen miles over the state line. You would think that at this stage of the trip I would be out of spine-tingling events or merely too tired to have any, but crossing into Florida and taking a photo of the rig leaned up against the pretentiously large welcome sign, I felt a huge sense of accomplishment and excitement.  I had ridden my bike from my parent's driveway to Florida, a place I had been twice before (once for family vacation and once for a track meet) but only getting there by airplane.  The excitement also stemmed from the fact that this part of the trip was unplanned for.  I never thought Florida would be on my list of 'ridden-through' states, but for the next twenty-four hours I would be cutting through the far reaches of the Floridian pan-handle.  And every second that I was in this state I would feel like I was adventuring to a higher degree.      Going due south again, I suffered from the same wind resistance that I had earlier (wind knows no state lines).  I made it to my potential campsite, outside Baker, around 6:30 under drizzling skies.  According to the wayside sign, the campsite was three miles off the main road I was on.  Although I felt good, I was not in the mood to ride three miles up some gravel road to a campsite that I had little knowledge about (only a mark on my Opp-purchased map indicating a camping area).  I decided to make a break for Milton, 20 miles away.  It was off of I10 and would surely have a requisite motel or two.  I turned right out of Baker and on to U.S. 90.  I would be on this road off-and-on all the way into New Orleans.  In fact, my place of employment is on U.S. 90.  Those twenty miles to Milton went by in a little over an hour and were a great joy.  The drizzle was light enough so as to not create a nuisance but heavy enough to keep me cool.   I found the Holiday Inn Express that I expected would be there - within one hundred feet of I10.  I checked in, ordered pizza, and did laundry.  I loved doing this bike-touring thing, especially today, because you never know how a day will turn out until its over.  And when you think things couldn't get worse (pepper spray on the epidermis) just persist, and you will have rewards (endorphins pumping during a fantastic stretch of flat riding with the wind at your back).
Accommodations: Gulf State Park  Quote of the Day: 'Hold on Bryan, Daddy's going to the bathroom.'   Heard inside the bathhouse of the Gulf Shores State Park as I brushed my teeth.  The author, in a stall, was trying to remotely control his son who was running all over the bathhouse and at the time of this quote, peeking into the stall.    I left the Holiday Inn Express and made the three-mile ride into town to the library under a light, chilly rain - the kind that would be refreshing at the end of a long day.  But, this rain irked me and portended a rough day ahead.  The Milton Public Library was in a municipal complex halfway up a hill in a residential part of town.  I explained myself, like usual, to the clerk at the front desk and was given an hour at a terminal.  In that time I finished one day's entry, updated the other days on the Table of Contents, and checked my email.  Promptly at one hour, the clerk asked me to relinquish my spot to a waiting patron.  I gladly complied, but not before helping an elderly fellow seated next to me - he was having trouble closing out Internet Explorer.  I showed him how to click on the 'X.'  He responded with a, 'Thank you, sonny.' A light rain fell throughout my morning of riding through the extreme western portion of Florida's panhandle.  For safety in the low-visibility conditions I made sure my red flashing light and amber strobe were on the entire morning.  Unfortunately, the strobe light uses up my rechargeable batteries very quickly.  Just outside Pensacola, I noticed that it was out of juice, so I pulled over to a park, which was nothing more than a parking lot on a man-made island between bridges in the Pensacola Bay. As I pried open the battery cover to the strobe light, my knife slipped and went squarely into my left thumb - leaving me with a half-inch gash that bled steadily.  I went straight to the first aid kit mounted under my saddle and patched up my self-inflicted wound.  This injury coupled with my multiple calluses on the palms of my hands ached and throbbed throughout the rest of the day.   I ate on the front curb of a gas station north of Pensacola under an awning - the standard fare:  a triangle sandwhich, chips, yogurt, fruit, and cookies.  Although I was wet and probably should have gotten back in the saddle to warm up, I sat, rested my tired body, and finished the last twenty pages of my book, A Walk Across America by Peter Jenkins - a very good book, not the best I've ever read, but still a fun, fulfilling, and easy read.  Whenever I got frustrated with the author's amateurish writing style, I had to remind myself that Jenkins was my age when he wrote the book, and he simply set out on his journey never intending to become an author.  I know my writing has plenty of problems, so I passed over his and concentrated on the great stories he told.   I remembered what my friend Olivia told me when she gave the book to me back in Chapel Hill.  Instead of mailing it back to her when I was finished, like I first suggested, she told me to give it to someone else.  I kinda took her advice - I scribbled a note on the title page - something like: To whoever picks up this book:  Please take this book and read it.  I hope it inspires you and opens your eyes to America's beauty like it has for me as I do my own journey from D.C. to New Orleans.  -Matt Spaeder  8/7/01  www.crazyguyonabike.com/doc/spaeder I left the book atop the leftmost public phone at that gas station at the corner of U.S. Alt 90 and U.S. 90.  [Please sign my guestbook if you have the book!  I'd love to hear from you.] Surprisingly, Pensacola had a good bit of hills, which taxed me more than I had hoped.  The light rain that was only a slight bother before, turned into a downpour for about thirty minutes as I rolled through downtown.  Not wanting to stop, I pressed on.  The rain finally finished completely, the sun came out, and the temperature rose.  I passed a General Nutrition Center in a suburban mall southwest of town and stopped in because it was Super Tuesday (the first Tuesday of each month is 20% off with a GNC Gold Card!).  I loaded up on Power Bars and the like.  'Eighteen miles to the state line,' the girl behind the counter told me.  And I was off. I rode steadily through the mid-afternoon down roads that wound through flat forests.  It didn't seem like the Gulf of Mexico would be on the other side of today's riding, but sometime around five, I saw my first resort condos rise out of the distance, and I knew the beaches and water couldn't be far.  I climbed a tall bridge over the Intracoastal Waterway and paused to take a photo of the waterway, the Gulf of Mexico, and the small spit of land in between, which would be my land for the next few hours.  Atop the bridge, exhausted and wet, I felt an incredible feeling of accomplishment wash over me.  The pain in my hands, the water in my shoes, the salt in my eyes, and the lactic acid that pumped through my blood vessels were momentarily dissolved from my active thoughts - I had ridden my bicycle from Washington, D.C. to the Gulf of Mexico.  I remembered when I was very young and it was a big deal for my brother and I to ride from our neighborhood to the next neighborhood over, Potomac Overlook.  And, a few years later we adventured into downtown McLean.  Now, I have made it halfway across the country to a body of water named after another nation.        I crossed back into Alabama in the late afternoon and battled winds as I traveled westward towards my place of rest for the evening.  At the huge Gulf State Park I went inside the park ranger hut to pay my $5.08 for a night's stay.  On the wall was a filing system that had one slot per campsite.  Only a few of the RV slots were occupied, and all of the tent camping sites were vacant - except now for me.  I only wondered about the lack of tent campers for three minutes - the three minutes it took me to ride from the hut to my site.  After leaning my rig against the picnic table, I instantly became intimately acquainted with the Alabama State Bird:  The Mosquito.  They were all over me.  Adjacent to my campsite was standing water and there was a canopy of trees over the grassy area of my site.  It was as if the mosquitoes had been waiting for human flesh to feast on.  I took my left saddlebag off the rack and searched through it for my insect repellent, all the while walking at a fast pace to try to keep some of those things off of me.  I caked on the DEET insect repellent which had only a moderate effect on the bugs.  I decided to set up camp on the other side of the camp road away from the water and away from the visible swarms of bugs.  As I buzzed (pun intended) from having the DEET flow through my blood, I quickly and sloppily pitched my tent.      I showered and rode a quarter-mile to the camp store, where I bought a loaf of bread, a mini-loaf of ham, and chocolate milk.  The clerk at the store told me to watch out for the alligator in the lagoon.  I think he told me this as less of a warning and more of a tourist tidbit.  He said the gator usually swims by the store at sunset.  So, as I ate, I sat by the lagoon on a bench waiting and watching for strange ripples of water.  I saw nothing.   I went back to the tent to relax and fall to sleep.  The air was thick and heavy, and I went through three pairs of rechargeable batteries in my fan trying to stay comfortable.  Now, without a book, I had little to do but write in my journal ("Worst day yet:  rain, then wind, then mosquitoes") and look at maps.  I fell into an uneasy sleep around ten.
Accommodations: Dauphin Island Motel    I awoke at 2am to the sound of rain on the outside of my tent.  I needed to go to the bathroom, but the prospects of going right outside the tent and being eaten by mosquitoes wasn't appealing.  On second thought, nor was making the 50 yard trek to the bathhouse.  I did, however, opt for the bathhouse, and I moved there with alacrity, hoping that the bugs wouldn't get me in transit.  Back in the tent, I quickly realized that I had some unwelcome guests piggyback in from the outside - more mosquitoes.  One by one I swatted them off of me and waited for them to take up perch on the inside of the tent.  I squished each one, leaving a small smattering of blood on the tent cloth.  This activity went on for a while, as I tried to rid my body and tent of about ten of those critters.  It was stuffy in the tent and the light mist falling (or rather, sitting) outside didn't help.  I told myself that I'd try once more to sleep before starting my day extra-early. At 3:15 I gave up and decided to eat breakfast and get my day rolling.  I ate inside my tent and then quickly broke camp.  One last trip to the bathhouse to shower and wake myself up.  I put my two last good rechargeable batteries in my strobe light and at 4:15 I left Gulf Shores State Park - taking with me memories of the worst night of my trip.  But my dismay with my current situation didn't seem to matter, once I was back on the rig.  I rode through the light mist two miles into town, not seeing a single soul.  I couldn't say that I felt energetic, but I was happy to be moving on - and moving on early. The Waffle House in downtown Gulf Shores burned bright as a beacon of civilization (and air conditioning).  I decided to stop in for a second breakfast.  There were no worries of looking like the strangest person there, in my spandex, as it was 4:30 in the morning and in my abnormalcy I fit right in.  After my deluxe breakfast I walked the rig across Alabama Route 182 to the Circle K to pick up a four-pack of Duracells - they would light my way to the ferryport. So, brightly lit up I rolled another two miles into a more commercial section of town.  There I got a better look at the road to Fort Morgan where I would catch the ferry across Mobile Bay.  After a quick glimpse at the tight two-lane unlit roadway, I decided to wait for daybreak.  I leaned my rig up against a storefront in a small strip mall and went to sleep on the concrete using my rolled up sleeping pad as a pillow.  Sunlight woke me up at 6:15, and I was rolling seconds later.  The ride to Fort Morgan was 19 miles and despite my lack of sleep, went by easily.  Morning talk-radio out of Mobile kept me company.  Fort Morgan, Alabama was nothing more than a Civil War-era fort and a handful of houses.  There was no sense of community.  No stores, no gas stations, except for a convenience store at the ferry dock which was closed when I was there.  I settled for two Sprites out of the soda machine.  After sitting down on a bench for a few moments I quickly realized why Fort Morgan wasn't so inhabited - mosquitoes.  They were everywhere and tenacious.  I walked out the ramp to the ferry about 50 feet over the water and just sat, so I could be left alone.        The 45-minute ride across the bay was scenic, but unsettling at the same time - a storm brewed to the northwest, my direction of travel.  I tried not to worry about it, because there was really nothing I could do.  I did make friends with a fellow New Orleanian, who I learned had a daughter in high school who needed tutoring in Algebra II.  We exchanged phone numbers, and I promised that I would call once in town.  [Spaeder-note:  This connection proved fruitful, as I was able to tutor the young lady throughout the fall semester, hopefully improving her logarithmic (and other mathematical) abilities.]    A light rain began to fall as I rolled off the ferry ramp and on to Dauphin Island.  As I rode away, one of the ferry's deck hands shouted to me:  'That's quite a storm ahead.  I saw it on our radar.'  A little worried, I rode, basically because I had little else to do. According to my map, it looked like there was a four-mile-long bridge between Dauphin Island and mainland Alabama.  It took about fifteen minutes to ride across the island and to the base of this bridge.  Just as I reached the bridge the heavens opened and dumped not just rain but pools of water.  I found refuge under a bank's drive-up window shelter.  The three tellers didn't give me any trouble for the twenty minutes I waited there, probably because they didn't receive any business during that time.  After the near monsoon slowed to a heavy shower, I decided to assess the situation on the bridge.  After climbing the first tenth-mile up the bridge to where it levels out and provides a good view of the entire span, I decided to call it quits.  The bridge was four miles long with a huge rise in the middle for boat traffic - all entirely too dangerous in the present conditions.  I turned back and decided to tackle this problem later. I rode to the nearby gas station to ask the clerk about the library and motel situation.  My hope was that I would bide my time in the former until the rain passed or check in to the latter and make an attempt in the morning.  My options were limited:  no library on the island and only one choice for motel.  It was still early in the day, around noon, but I thought I'd give the motel a chance.  I was tired of being wet and tired (literally).  The clerk at the Dauphin Island Motel did help me out by checking me in early, but he made a point of the fact that he was doing me a favor.   I checked in, slept, and woke up to partly sunny skies around five.  I was tempted to take off again and make it to Mississippi, but opted to eat, get to sleep early, and wake up at 4am for an attempted 150 mile assault on New Orleans.  Final duty for the evening was to purge all unneeded items:  two dehydrated meals, candy, & spare tires.  I wanted to be as light as possible for my big day.  Asleep by 8:30pm.
Accommodations:  Best Western Quote of the Day: "ERN3HRT" Seen on a license plate in Ocean Springs, Mississippi.      I was up at 4am and out the door by 4:50.  Brightly lit, I rode off of Dauphin Island and on to the bridge that was impassable for me yesterday.  It was a queazy but exciting feeling to be on this bridge alone over a big body of water in the near darkness.  I felt safe, because I could see cars coming for many minutes in advance.  Predawn light flickered in the sky as I made it over the huge rise in the bridge.  Yesterday, from a distance, this rise seemed tame, but now that I was climbing it I realized just how big it was.  At the very top, I paused my pedaling and coasted to a near stop.  I was about 50 feet above the sea, and yet again amazed at the places this bike trip has taken me.      Back on land, I really wasn't "on" land - I was on a bridge over marsh with the Mobile Bay to my right and high scrub brush to my left.  One boat of fishermen leaving the slip for the morning shined their flood light on me and give me a wave and a loud, "Hi!"  I bellowed back with a, "Hello!"  Each minute in the morning brought more light and more pick-ups on the road en route to their oyster boats for the day. I rolled through Bayou La Batre, the shrimping home of Forrest Gump, and stopped quickly at a gas station for some water and to pump up my front tire - it had been losing air slowly throughout the early morning.  Every few minutes I glanced at the time and my average speed to calculate and recalculate how I was doing and my ETA in New Orleans.  And around 8am, I crossed the state line (sorry, no sign) into Mississippi, right on schedule.  It was warm, but certainly not the worst it's been, but I noticed that I was drinking much more water and sweating more than usual.  I was able to find water throughout the morning with no problem, but I did wonder why I was consuming so much.  Nonetheless, I figured if I kept up my pace I would make it into the Big Easy around sunset.  A few miles west of Pascagoula my slow leaking front tire pinch-flatted.  This occurrence was the turning point of the day for me.  I could barely muster the energy to change the flat (a front tire, the easier of the two, nonetheless).   Once I completed the change-out, which took 15 minutes, ten more than it should have, I unwillingly got back on the bike.  I was now off of schedule, but more importantly out of inspiration.  I told myself that New Orleans wasn't happening today, it just wasn't a smart idea to make that assault in this heat, with my dead legs.  Once I made that decision, I actually felt considerably better - the pressure was off, and I could just enjoy the day.   I rode about five more miles to Gautier where a green sign of an iconographic person reading a book caught my eye - a library was nearby.  I stopped in for an hour of much needed cool air and computer-time.  I updated my website with information concerning where I have been and my new ETA in New Orleans:  5:00pm tomorrow. The rest of my day consisted of slow riding through resort towns and the boring 6 lane stretches between them.  Two more flats on the front tire began to make me wonder if it was a good idea to purge my spare tires in the motel last night.  At that time I thought I had my two best tires on the rig, but maybe I was wrong.   I stopped for forty-five minutes at the wayside Mississippi Vietnam Veterans Memorial.  The structure wasn't anything impressive, simply an open marble structure the size of a small house.  But inside were large photos on the walls of every serviceman from Mississippi that perished in the war - with their name, rank, and hometown listed underneath.  It wasn't the memorial itself, of course, that was intended to impress me, it was feelings evoked by those photos of guys my age or less that were killed in action while fighting for freedom.  I don't know how many there were from Mississippi, my guess would be about one thousand, but I made sure to glance at each photo, even for only a second or two.  Doing some research (looking in the yellow pages) I found a bike store in Biloxi where I stopped in for two more tubes and to shoot the breeze with the kind shopkeepers.  One of the men asked me whether I was riding the Southern Tier of the Transcontinental Route (there are three main cross-country semi-friendly bike routes and the southernmost-one passes through Biloxi), embarrassed that I was doing less than half of that, I explained where I've been and where I'm going to.  They were, nonetheless, excited for me especially because the trip was almost over.  We chatted some about New Orleans and the French Quarter  I checked into a Best Western near the casino-section of town, and immediately took a shower and gulped down a large Papa John's Pizza.  I relaxed the rest of the evening, except around nine when I went for a short walking tour of that part of town as I was in pursuit of an evening snack.  Before I went to bed I wrote in my journal, 'Tired.  Wish I were home.  But excited for tomorrow.'    I was very happy how the trip had been going, but that night my senses were dulled with fatigue. 
   My morning riding went by easily, as I knew that later that day I would be home.  I did, however, continue to have some trials and tribulations mechanically.  Actually, the rig itself, performed wonderfully, as it has done for the past four weeks.  The cyclocomputer, which had been giving me fits for the past many many days finally quit on me.  The problem, a loose wire connecting the sensor to the computer, has been creating a few gaps (nominal ones, only a couple of minutes at a time) in my distance calculations.  But, today no matter what shimmying I did with the wire, the computer would just give me a zero reading.  I decided to plain ole' forget about it and simply calculate my mileage the old-fashioned way - with a map.  Consequently, I don't have my ride time or average speed for the day.  But, this problem seemed kind of fitting:  the ride isn't about numbers or mileage, it's about the journey (in the broad sense of the term).   Besides, that inconsequential problem, I got another front tire flat outside of Bay St. Louis.  Like the three flats yesterday, I thoroughly inspected the tire for debris and again was surprised to find nothing.  There were a couple of small holes that I patched up with double-layered inner-tube rubber (from the tube that just went flat) and duct tape.  I was hoping that my jerry-rigged tire would get me home.  To cover my butt, however, I checked a yellow pages in Bay St. Louis for a bike store on my route home, and to my surprise found none.  I did stop, however, at a Wal-Mart in Waveland and purchased a tire and one tube (so I now was carrying two spare tubes).  [Spaeder-note:  I was in such a tizzy at the Wal-Mart that I didn't bother to check the valve type on the tube.  I had accidentally purchased a Shrader valve.  I didn't realize this until two days later when I was unpacking my stuff.  Fortunately, I didn't need it anyway.] Shortly after my Wal-Mart visit U.S. 90 took on a new look - no longer serving Gulf coast resorts, but now ducking through flat scrub brush.  I crossed the state line into Louisiana around 1pm and encountered bridge after bridge over swamps and bayous as I made my way southwestward.  I have been out this way on day rides, so I was somewhat familiar with the territory and I knew where my water availability was.  By this time of the day the morning clouds had mostly burned off and it was very hot - easily in the low 90's.          There was a possibility that there would be some students waiting for me at Brother Martin High School at 5:00pm, so I tried my best to stay on schedule, despite one last flat tire (a rear one).  An impending thunderstorm kept me on my toes, but fortunately passed to the north.  I am told that New Orleans is one of the largest cities (in area) in the country.  Much of that land is uninhabitable due to topographical reasons, but it added a little frustration for me because I was in New Orleans proper by about 3:15, and I knew I still had a long way to go.  I reached the city-like part of New Orleans by 4:30, and despite running low on water I just rode non-stop.  I could taste victory.    WARNING:  If you can't stomach grotesque sites, kindly scroll over the following photo quickly.  This ride was brutal and I saw some ugly sites - here's one of them:    I rode along the railroad tracks of the railroad I used to work for, then adjacent to Lake Pontchatrain where I used to go for Saturday afternoon bike rides, and then by Brother Martin where I currently work - no students waiting, but I wasn't surprised.  I kept going south on Elysian Fields Avenue into the French Quarter, and then I rode down Decatur Street.      I'll forsake any philosophizing here for the sake of brevity, but I will say that I was amazed that I had made it so far - that it really was possible to ride my bicycle halfway across the U.S.A.  The streets were abuzz with activity as it was a warm Saturday evening.  In some ways I felt like I was in a bubble, unaffected by the things and unconnected to the people around me, and at the same time I have never felt more alive, more in tune to my surroundings.  The feelings that washed over me throughout those last ten miles are hard to explain.  My mind and body were playing wonderful tricks on my mood and emotions - triggering intensities that had not been felt ever before.  My physical and mental elements had been working full throttle over the past four weeks (and prior, in training and planning phases), and now they were signaling my emotions and feelings to soak up the success.   The last few miles took me down St. Charles Ave. where I raced (and beat) street cars to Audubon Park - finally, through the park and to my apartment on Magazine Street.  My landlord was out washing her car, and asked, 'How was your summer?'  Too excited to really elaborate, I just smiled and said, 'Great.'    Show links to this Hide links to this

TOP FIVE ITEMS THAT I WISH I HAD WITH ME... 5.  Digital Camera - for easier and cheaper posting to the website. Although my $30 35mm camera got the job done, having a digital camera with me would have been a treat.   4.  Dictaphone - for on the road journal entries.  All too often I thought of something that I wanted to write about, something I experienced, and by the next time I could write at a pit stop the lucid description had left my memory.   3.  More Training - would have enabled me to go farther, faster with more time to stop and smell the roses.  I was traveling in Europe for the month prior to my bike trip.  And although I was active and managed a few jogs in random places and was in pretty good shape anyway, I wasn't as prepared for this trip as I could have been.   2.  Rear View Mirror - for the obvious.  It's an easy safety precaution to take that can have definite safety advantages. 1.  Business Cards - for all of the people that asked about the trip.  So many times people would question me about what I was up to and some actually asked if I had a website.  A card provides a tangible memory to folks (I still have Robert Lovett's from day 18) and is a handy record of my website address.
Neil Gunton - He is the mastermind behind crazyguyonabike.com.  He runs the site for free and has provided help to me over the phone and via email on a wide range of technical issues - not the least of which was standing guard over my site this summer as some of my tactless students posted unsavory guestbook entries.  When I started my journal in April, 2001  I was one of the first five journals on the site.  Since then the site has grown tremendously, and its features have made it more user friendly and fun.  Its growth stands as a testament to Neil's excellent vision and attention to detail.  The trip itself was very fun for me, but the ability to have a wonderful place to post my thoughts and photos multiplied my enjoyment.  So, thanks to Neil for not just the creation of the free site but also the superp administration of it. Olivia Seney, Courtney Everett & Allen Bradd - All three of these folks are fellow Carolina grads that graciously opened their apartment (or in Allen's case, motel room) to me as I passed through town.  Chapel Hill wasn't exactly on the way but knowing that I had a place to stay and old friends to visit made it worth veering off course.   Dave Blazejewski - Dave is a good friend of mine that I met while working on the railroad (insert joke here), and has remained so even after my locomotive days were over.  He resides in New Orleans and provided (whether he knew it or not) inspiration to me during the spring of 2001 while I was planning the trip.  Dave is an adventurer in his own way, spending any free time he's had in the past or now in the present, traveling the U.S.A. and more often than not, chasing trains.  It was good to bounce ideas off of him while I was conceptualizing the trip, and he was sure to give me any interesting railroading trivia and geography about the places I'd be riding through. Harry Hardin - Harry is my roommate here on Magazine Street in New Orleans and provided a ton of logistical support to me this past summer, including:  paying the bills, receiving mail and packages, mailing my mail to me during the summer, taking the "before" and "after" photos, allowing me to use his computer after mine was fried, and on and on.  But, most of all, he has had to deal with my strange lifestyle, that in the spring of 2001, revolved around planning for this trip.   Mom, Dad, Mike, and Shannon Spaeder & Gail Mierzejewski - Owning a dog is a wonderful thing.  Samantha (my geriatric black beauty of a Labrador Retriever) has given me a lot of joy over her twelve years of life, but of course she wasn't allowed on this trip.  I did entertain an option (momentarily) of putting her in a trailer and hauling her myself south to New Orleans.  However, the Spaeders in Northern Virginia and D.C. willingly (with a sigh) took care of her for the time I was riding the rig.  This may not sound like a big task, but I know that they have grown accustomed to life post-Sam and would rather not have the hair, the whining, or smells in their domiciles.  So, I thank them hugely for taking Sam in.  Without this help, the trip could have never happened.  I would also like to thank Gail for volunteering to fly with Sam (as baggage -- that is: the dog as baggage, Gail as a passenger) on a USAir flight from BWI to New Orleans on August 31st.  Sam needed a way to get down here, and Gail volunteered to brave the heat and humidity of Nola to help me out. Guestbook signers and website visitors - I'd like to thank the readers of www.crazyguyonabike.com/doc/spaeder for checking out my site throughout the summer and afterwards too.  Thank you for your patience as I took way too long to finish this thing.  In under a year there have been over 11,000 individual page requests on my site alone making it the tenth-most popular journal on all of crazyguyonabike.com (and the best ranking journal for an under-one-month-ride).  I know that there are a few people that can account for a large amount of those hits, but I feel that the journal has had widespread appeal.  Thanks to everyone for signing my guestbook, and if you haven't yet, please do.  It was a great inspiration to read, during and after the trip, the postings to my guestbook.  Knowing that people were reading the site made me enthusiastic to not just write but also ride and experience more things.   Mom and Dad Spaeder - No, they weren't going to get away with just being thanked for taking care of the dog.  As I planned the trip this past spring I knew that I would have a hard sell on my hands convincing my parents that I should go.  Sure, I am at the age where I don't need to ask for their permission, nor was their blessing necessary, but I did want to feel in my heart that I wasn't hurting them emotionally by riding my bicycle alone through the South.  They did basically, all I could ask them to do:  ask questions, show their concern, but wish me luck.  I made a pact with them to call at least every other day, and fortunately I was able to keep to that (actually, I was able to call almost every day).  I think that helped, as well as the two of them reading on the website about what I was up to.  I do know that this trip made my mother worry a lot (so I am told by my family members and her co-workers and friends), so that is why I must thank her even more so for being so "cool" (for lack of a better word) with me on the phone when we talked.  So, a big thanks goes out to Mom and Dad for handling the situation perfectly, just as they have handled most everything with me over the past 24 years.  And one more thing, although the Spaeder family wasn't a traveling clan as the children grew up, Mom and Dad did instill in me an intellectual curiosity, a strong work ethic, and a tolerance for others that were essential for this trip. I sincerely I hope I didn't explicitly forget anyone.   Finally, I would like to thank all of the people on the road that provided me with funny, touching, and long-lasting memories.
This trip, by far, exceeded my expectations.  It was more of everything than I thought it would be:  more fun, more difficult, more exhilarating, more work, more surprising, etc.  All too often people (myself definitely included) walk through life not living it to the fullest.  For four weeks my life centered around a goal, and I felt completely alive.  My mind tired but never got bored nor inattentive.  To anyone thinking of doing a similar trip, I say, without reservation, "Go for it!"   This trip was much more than being about Matt Spaeder.  It was, more importantly, about visiting places and people other than those familiar to me.  On that note, and in conclusion, I'll finish with a passage I wrote in my journal on a bench outside a gas station on day 12 in Fort Mill, South Carolina:  This country is filled with mile upon mile of what we metropolitan inhabitants call "fly over territory," simply because that is as close as we'll ever get to it:  viewing the land from an airplane window.  But that land is filled with beautiful wilderness and wonderful people.  Sure, many of them are parochial in their views and tacky in their exterior home decor, but on the inside many of them are great people.  They'll sit and talk for awhile and never look at their watch.  They'll wave at 'ya on the highway or give a thumbs up.  Their interests may be different than mine, but their hearts know what dedication, caring, and kindness are all about. -ms
  February, 2003 I've decided to take a different approach with this journal.  Compared to my previous journals, you'll see that this one is much less wordy (phew!).  I'm going this route, because I think I went a little overboard on some of my other journal entries - going into extra-fine detail in areas where it wasn't needed.  Moreover, I've taken some very good photos -- I'll let them speak for the trip.  Also, I didn't get to write in my journal on the road after day one, because I was way too busy, so recalling each aspect of each of my days would be too difficult.    I don't have scanned-in detailed maps of each day's route like I did for the previous two trips, because my maps were either ruined in the rain or burned as fire-starters somewhere on the C&O Canal (where they were no longer needed - the navigation home from the canal is easy).  I've acquired, via the wonderful world wide web, some great and not-so-great maps that I'll share with you throughout the journal.  I'm not going to worry too much about trying to depict the terrain on a two-dimensional map, because frankly the computer screen won't do the topography justice.  West Virginia is called the Mountain State for a reason, and no amount of staring at contour lines or ridges on a map will make that fully sink in.    From a navigational (of this site) standpoint, I have a few things to say...   First, the mileage data is approximate.  I didn't bring my cyclocomputer with me, because I was on such a short trip, and the C&O Canal portion was fortunately marked with mileposts.   Secondly, CLICK TO ENLARGE!!!  I've got a ton of photos and maps (i.e. the light green map above) that had to be shrunk down to comply with the parameters the webmaster created.  To see my images in their full-sized glory, simply click on them.  Then when you're ready to return to the journal entry, just hit the back button on your browser.   Or try another option:  if your connection speed is fast enough and/or you don't mind waiting for large images to load, you can set this site to always give you the "Large" versions of the pics.  To do that is also quite easy:(1) Click "Options" at the top this page.  (2) Select "Large size pictures," and click "Set option."   You can give one of those techniques a try to view the large version of the photo below...    Okay, I'm almost done...Since I won't be writing a concluding entry for this trip, and I won't be writing much in the daily entries, I wanted to share a few thoughts.  First, this trip kicked my ass.  But I loved it.  Mile for mile this journey was much more difficult than my trek to New Orleans of two summers ago.  The mountains gave me incredible elevation variations that ached my legs on ascent and my hands as they worked the brakes on descent.   The weather varied between raining and 40's on day three to sweltering hot in the high 90's on days five and six.  I corrected many of my mistakes that I made from the New Orleans trip including packing a little better and training a lot harder, but I still underestimated how far I could go in a day in the mountains.  Sixty miles, fully loaded, up and down big mountains just isn't possible for more than one day.   On two separate nights on the Canal I went through all of my matches as I tried to start a fire to heat up dinner, all to no avail; I ate beef jerkey and snack-mix both times.  I was frustrated like crazy by multiple flat tires from a slightly ill-positioned brake shoe that slowly shredded the sidewall of my tire with each unsuspecting pull of the brakes.  But I made it home - somehow.  I learned from the experience and won't let it (or my other mistakes) happen again.   Yes, there will be another trip.  I don't know when, but I'm hooked -- and I've got miles and miles of America to explore.
         
  Accommodations:  Blackwater Falls State Park Quote of the Day:   "I dunno.  It's gotta be a West Virginia thing."  Overhead in the deli/gas station/convenience store in Grantsville as two Maryland women discuss their boyfriends.  One of their beaus is from West Virginia, and the two women can't figure out why he's been acting strange lately.      My experience with Greyhound was excellent.  It wasn't that anyone provided me superb customer service, rather it was simply that Greyhound provided me the opportunity to ship myself and my bike almost anywhere in the U.S. with little hassle.   From the depot in Northeast DC we traveled south over the Potomac on the 14th Street bridge and west along the Geoerge Washington Memorial Parkway.  From my perch on the right side of the bus I had a good view of the river that I'd be intimately involved with for the next week.  After an hour ride to Hagerstown I departed the bus and carried the bike box over to a nearby McDonald's for a second breakfast and a relaxing read of the Hagerstown Herald.   I walked my box back to the bus depot, lay it down outside and sat inside, reading magazines.  The depot in Hagerstown was about the size of a small double-wide home and was staffed by one elderly woman.  During my layover I chatted with two seniors at James Madison University from Woodstock, Virginia en route to New York City.  They were Greyhounding to Baltimore and then north to the Big Apple.  They were excited because besides touring the normal attractions in NYC they had tickets to the Late Show with David Letterman.  Pretty cool.   One more Hagerstown bus depot story...A white van pulled up with a uniformed officer and two large men.  The officer asked the ticket agent for one ticket to Baltimore and one to DC.  She obliged.  He paid her, and wished his newly released cons good luck; "I hope to never see you again," the corrections officer said with a smile.  He shook their hands and left.  Of the twenty minutes that we shared together in that depot the men spent all of it smiling and much of it trying to win the attention of a young lady.   My second Greyhound dipped in and out of valleys as we made our way up to Grantsville via U.S. Alt 40, making brief stops in Cumberland and Frostburg.  At my destination the bus eased to the side of the road and the front door opened.  The driver quickly but not hurriedly followed me out and then opened the baggage bay, and I pulled the bike box out.  As quickly as he got off, he was back on -- I heard him kick off his brakes and slowly pull his diesel away.  The trip thus began:  one day to the start of the river, then four or five days following it to Alexandria.        The afternoon was a ton of work getting over the mountains, but the scenery was spectacular.  One check of the map near Kearney told me that I'd have a great coast down into the Potomac River valley.  The map wasn't wrong.  I cruised into Gorman very excited to see the river for the first time since DC.  A nice waitress filled up my water bottle free of charge at a restaurant at the river's edge, and I was off to cross into West Virginia for the first time (no sign though).      I paralleled the river for a dozen or so miles keeping it to my right, pulling moderate climbs as I got closer and closer to the start of the river.  In Henry, WV my route broke away from the river and started heading more southward toward Davis, which was my camping spot for the evening and an excellent staging point for a pilgrimage to the Fairfax Stone (the headspring of the river) the following morning. John J. Rambo (straight out of First Blood) seemed to be passing through Thomas, WV at the same time as I was - fortunately we were going in opposite directions.  What this guy lacked in brawn, he made up for in weirdness.  I don't remember who stopped whom (I think I was just traveling slowly and I eased to a stop at a safe distance from him as he began talking to me), but I remember a brief exchange with him on the main drag of Thomas near a city water fountain.  "Rambo" was wearing a bandanna around his forehead, a cut-off heather grey sweatshirt-turned-t-shirt, and a large camping backpack (circa 1982) with a tattered grey bedroll strapped on top.  His monologue consisted of three consecutive elements: 1)  "The people in the grocery store are mean." 2)  "Don't drink the water." (pointing to the water fountain) 3)  "The trucks are trying to run me over."     I think I just nodded at each of his declarations or said, "Okay," and then our "conversation" was over.  As I rolled away I looked over my left shoulder and saw him giving the finger to a passing truck.  The Rambo similarities were too obvious to ignore - and I spent the rest of my time in Thomas thinking about this guy taking on the local police in a crazy guerrilla battle. I stopped at the grocery store anyway (no mean people there), picked up dinner and breakfast, packed them away and rode the last few miles to the campground in Davis in the post-sunset light.
  Accommodations:  Mountaineer Motel Quote of the Day:  "Yeah, it's got a motel, but I wouldn't stay there - it ain't been American owned for a while."Heard from the convenience store/deli proprietor in Bayard, WV in response to my question, "Is there anywhere to stay in Mount Storm?"  More details below.                                      I made an unplanned stop at the post office in Bayard, West Virginia and sent home as much stuff as I could do without.  It didn't end up being a lot, but every ounce off the rig was well worth it for my legs.  I asked the postal clerk for places to find a sandwich, and she directed me to next door.   My club sandwich was excellent and about halfway through eating it, the proprietor's husband and son walked in the store to say hello to their wife/mom.  Before that though, the middle-aged man and his nine year-old son inspected the rig as it leaned against the front wall of the grocery.  I recognized the man from the day before.  I passed through Bayard yesterday evening going in the opposite direction, and I remember having this one man stare me down as I rode through town.  At the time, yesterday, I thought the stare was one of anger, but as soon as he walked in the store today I could tell that it was really a stare of curiosity.  I sat, eating near the front door of the grocery as the father and son walked in.  After a quick hello to the owner, they stopped by my table and struck up conversation.  The father and son had big smiles on their faces as I told them of my travels.  The father mentioned that he had seen me the night before.  Well, anyway, we chatted for a little bit, and then I told him that I was hoping to make it to Cumberland tonight and if not, that I'd like to stay somewhere along the way.  Right about then I was given the QOTD by his wife who had joined the convesation midstream.  Her comment didn't really sour me to the conversation, but it did make me think about what I was going to find in Mount Storm.  Anyway, we talked for a total of ten minutes as I finished up my sandwich and packed up the rig.  The man told me about how he'd always wanted to ride the C&O Canal from start to finish but never got around to it.  In the 80's, he said, he had ridden about 60 miles of it with a buddy and enjoyed it a lot,  but never got around to riding the whole thing.   My ride to Mount Storm had huge climbs and descents that took a lot out of me.  It was a pattern that I'd repeat often:  climb at 4 to 5 mph for 20-30 minutes and then sit in the saddle and enjoy the descent at 30mph.  During the course of one of my climbs one particular beat-up blue mid-80's sedan passed me twice, each time going in opposite directions.  On the second pass the passenger threw a plastic beverage bottle at me hitting one of my saddlebags.  Nice.  I guess that must have been exciting for them. I made it to Mount Storm, which consisted of the motel, a volunteer fire department, a few houses, a library, a West Virginia DOT facility, and a convenience store (which I didn't see until I was riding out of town the next morning).  The proprietors of the Inn were a husband and wife, looking to be of Indian descent.  They had their five year-old son with them.  It was odd to see anything but a white person in this part of the country, but to say that these folks weren't Americans was simply simple-minded.  Anyway, they gave me the keys to my chalet.    Before I moved in I inquired about food, first borrowing the yellow pages to call pizza places, all to no avail.  Mount Storm was too far away from any business's delivery zone.  So, I asked the owner if there was a gas station nearby, and he told me that one to two miles down Route 42 (the road that intersects the road that I was on as I came into town) there was a BP station.      How this place made money (I was the only guest at $20) or why this family, most-likely not from West Virginia, chose to live here were objects of my curiosity.  But, I never got to learn those things because I didn't see the owners again during my stay. I stripped the rig down and suited up in the drizzle for a short jaunt to the BP station that the owner had told me about.  After about three or four miles down Route 42 I got a little frustrated, because I was unable to find what I was looking for.  Just before I turned around, I stopped at an office for a mining company that had a light on.  The gentleman told me of the BP station, another one or two more miles down the road.  I thanked him and huffed in frustration at my bad direction-giver back at the motel.  Anyway, I got some goodies at the BP and then headed "home." After dinner, I took a shower and while drying myself off in the bathroom hit my head on the single exposed 60 watt light bulb that lit the bathroom at 6'1" off the ground (note:  I'm 6'2").  The light shattered, and I found myself tip-toeing out of the bathroom in barefeet.  After dressing and eating, I cleaned up the mess.   The local news stations were out of Pittsburgh and were centered around the mining disaster in Quecreek, Pennsylvania.  At the time the miners were still stuck underground.  Even though my day was centered around finding the headspring of the Potomac and following the flow downriver, my journey took me extensively around Maryland and West Virginia coal-country.  The news struck more of a chord with me today than it would have if I had never made it to this part of the country.  Maybe that's what traveling's all about:  seeing new places and experiencing new things so as to widen the realm of understanding of all things.

  Accommodations:  Antietam Creek Campground on the C&O Canal    Visit Number ONE:  Hooligans 2:09 a.m.  Awoke to the sound of fireworks being shot off from the banks of the nearby creek. 2:11 a.m.  Dialed 911 and told dispatcher of my quandary and location.  Referred to the National Park Service's C&O Canal Ranger number. 2:13 a.m.  Spoke to the Ranger Dispatcher and again explained my situation.  Fortunately for me (for proving that there was a problem), the fireworks were still booming away while I was on the phone.  I was told that the ranger on duty would be calling me soon. 2:15 a.m.  Ranger Nayler promptly called and said that he had just returned home from a different call.  He said that he would suit back up and be on his way. 2:33 a.m.  The dispatcher called and told me that Ranger Nayler was on his way - should be there in twenty minutes.  I sat silent in my tent while the fireworks became fewer and farther between.  I could hear faint conversation between two male voices.  I was separated from the scene of the crime by about 30 yards of thick forest, but a semi-direct path led from them to me.  I didn't want them coming my way, so I just sat still and hoped that these innocuous but annoying pains remained the former and didn't move so they could get nabbed when Nayler arrived. 2:54 a.m.  The phone rings again:  the dispatcher.  "The ranger has arrived.  Walk around and see if you can find him."  I thought it was a strange suggestion, but I hadn't heard anything for ten minutes, so I thought the coast was clear.  I headed out of the tent with flashlight, knife, and pepper spray at the ready, and walked up to the tow path.      Visit Number TWO:  Ranger Nayler, National Park Service The ranger was a middle-aged man with a moustache.  Don't let the olive green uniform fool you, this guy meant serious business, and was packing heat like your everyday street cop.  Ranger Nayler traveled alone but carried confidence and curiosity with him.  He said he had found evidence of the hooligans, spent fireworks, and that the lone car parked by the creek had dead plates.  He was glad that I called this in, and he told me he was going back to look for the suspects.  He said that everything would be fine and that I could go back to sleep, and then finally he asked whether I was alone.  And then that was it.  My experience was over.  I don't think anyone was caught, but at least I got a little peace of mind.  I tip-toed back to the tent and surprisingly fell right to sleep.        Visit Number THREE (and by far, the best):  Gail, my ladyfriend  Gail made the 80 minute trip (it ended up being much more than that because of bad signage in Sharpsburg) from her apartment in DC out to Antietam to bring me a BBQ dinner, some bike supplies, and many smiles.  I went for a swim while she cooked our turkey burgers on the grill and snapped some photos, and then we relaxed together over a good meal.  Plus, she brougt a ton of chocolate.  Around sunset she headed back home to make it to work the next morning.  (Thank you very, very much for coming!)

Sometimes, Lori rode with me; other times, she rode around the BWI trail with Karen or Kelly instead.   The distance to work was seven miles each way.  I started by driving my bike to a mall near work and riding one mile to work.  As I got used to this, I moved the car farther and farther away until it was about 4 miles away from work, parked in a MARC station, a month or so later. I got stuck there for a while.  There wasn't another good spot to park between there and home.  Besides, there was a big hill.  It was enough to convince us, though, that we could keep it up.  So we got ready to buy new bikes. Then, we saw the map.  Maryland puts out a little map that rates roads for bikability.  A line through the middle of the state indicated the path of the American Discovery Trail (ADT), a trail from coast to coast.  We thought that sounded like fun.  My contract was scheduled to end in February, and there were some other travel opportunities we wanted to pursue, but we decided to add a bike trip to our plans. We bought our bicycles, both hybrids for stability and for use on trails, and by August, I was biking at least 3 times a week the entire 14 miles roundtrip to work and back.  By October/November, though, the weather was too rough and I dropped off to hardly riding at all again.   We did some planning and purchasing over the winter and early spring.  We found that the ADT had major portions which were not suitable for bicycle touring, but we also discovered the Adventure Cycling maps.  We had to figure our own way up to the Adventure Cycling routes, but we didn't think it would be too much trouble, what with the C&O Canal towpath & Pennsylvania trail system almost getting us all the way from DC to Pittsburgh.   There was some panic as we bought last minute items, and we were on our way.  The following pages are my journal, kept on a Handspring Visor, and transferred directly to the site via modem whenever we could get a good connection.  There are also some essays by Lori.  Because we couldn't find a keyboard for the Visor (we bought the Edge to conserve weight, but its interface is different enough to prevent using the keyboards that work with the other Visors), she decided to keep her journal on paper.  Using the Visor means that my entries are generally terse.  Lori is now transferring her journal from paper to the site.  These entries will appear at the bottom of the site as she gets them in.  Her entries will likely have a lot more detail than mine.  (She is the writer, after all.)   As we went along, I tried to incorporate changes in the kind of information included based on reader comments. Seattle is Very Far Away We realized pretty early that we just did not go fast enough to get across the country with the time & money we had set aside.  We tended to go 30-35 miles on days we rode at all, and we took lots of breaks.  My impression from other sites is that ardent cross-country cyclists hit 70-100 miles/day.  We also realized that it wasn't the goal of going across the country that was so interesting to us as much as it was the interest of seeing people and things along the way.  So, we stayed at lots of B&Bs instead of camping, and we kept to a slower pace, allowing us to see and experience the country around us (Lori even participated in pottery contest in Cambridge, Wisconsin).   The weather was terrible, too, for the month after our first two weeks.  The wind and the rain slowed us down and discouraged us greatly.  Approaching Chicago, we were considering stopping there at the beginning of June.  But we rested well in Chicago with our friends, we received encouragement from several sources, and we really looked forward to seeing Minneapolis.   So, we decided to keep going until we got close to the Fourth of July, then find some nice little town to spend the holiday.  I think we picked a great place.   The original title of these journals was Washington to Washington, but we changed that to Washington to Wherever when we revised our objectives.  Otherwise, I didn't really change anything after-the-fact, so these journals are pretty much my feelings as things happened (or within a day of things happening).  I think it will be a few more weeks before we can really review the trip and answer one of the two questions we get asked most: "Did you enjoy the trip?"  Apparently, it's not obvious from the journal entries.   I hope you enjoy this site.  I think that Neil performed a great service by giving us an easy way to keep folks in touch with our goings-on.  So, now the bike trip is over and we return to normal life.  Well, not really.  The bike trip was just another leg in our 2001 Life Odyssey.  After trips to the American SouthWest and New Zealand, followed by this here bike trip, we are ready to settle down and find work.  We'd like to find work overseas, especially Scotland or Ireland, so we'll be spending some time searching for work.  I guess we could keep a journal on the search and eventual migration.  Hmmm. If you know of anyone in Ireland or Scotland who needs a configuration/release/project manager, drop us a line.  Somewhere around Minneapolis, I thought it would be cool to get to 1500 miles because the journal entries added up to something within 100 of that.  I was elated when we got to Bayfield, and I could say we had ridden over 1500 miles.   Unfortunately, I had entered the same day twice in these web pages so the total was wrong.  We've removed one of the entries, now.  And, sadly, we didn't quite make it.  But, as I said before, we learned early that for the trip to be fun, we had to make sure the objective was seeing stuff and experiencing the country, NOT making arbitrary mileage goals.
"Wouldn't it be fun if we rode across the US on our bikes?" he asked his wife, L, almost as a joke, pretty sure she'd say no. "Sure!" she said, surprising J.   And that's how we decided to ride across the country on our bikes.  It turned out that the ADT is not really suited for a cross-country bicycle trip, though it looks great for a walking trip.  So, we settled on Adventure Cycling's Northern Tier (see http://www.adventurecycling.org/routes/notier.cfm). We didn't want to start in Maine, so we are going to start with the C&O canal (see http://www.atatrail.org/seg-maps/cno15.htm), which should feed us into the Great Allegheny Passage (see http://www.atatrail.org/seg-maps/overmap.htm).  This will drop us just outside Pittsburgh.  We'll take US 30 into Ohio (see http://www.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs.cmu.edu/user/spok/bike/raccoon-creek.html), and use the cross-state trails in Ohio (trails CT & K, see http://www.dot.state.oh.us/bike/Default.htm) to get us to the Northern Tier, which will take us through Indiana, Illinois, Iowa, Wisconsin, Minnesota, North Dakota, Montana, Idaho and Washington.  The end point of the Northern Tier is Anacortes, Washington.
      
We have our bags, finally -- thanks to College Park Bicycles! -- and our camping gear.  I think we have nothing left to buy except some food.   But we still have to pack and practice using these weird clipless pedal things.  Today, we go out for a spin around the BWI trail.  Hope we don't kill ourselves before the trip! I wanted to list people who've been nice to us: The camping guy at REI (not the bike guy) Chad at College Park Bicycles Everyone at Sun&Ski up at Arundel Mills Mall Ann at Columbus Outdoor Pursuits (Ohio) --> http://www.outdoor-pursuits.org  Jessica at Allegheny Trail Alliance (PA) --> http://www.atatrail.org Bud in Upper Sandusky Those Happy Kids at J'ville Pub & Grill And, this website was very helpful --> http://www.his.com/~jmenzies/urbanatb/trails/canal/canal.htm  It has good milepost lists for the C&O canal, including a PDA-friendly version more stuff I want to remember to look at again later: Wisconsin: Wisconsin Trails (http://www.dnr.state.wi.us/org/land/parks/specific/index.html) Glacial Drumlin State Trail (http://www.glacialdrumlin.com/)
We're trying to figure out whether the advantages of the C&O canal towpath outweigh the disadvantages: Advantages  Disadvantages  Haven't stayed at a place that lets my PDA modem hook up, so the reports will continue to be intermittent.  These first few days were entered from a library in Hancock, MD.
This is what I wrote in my PDA: 1:10pm:  Lunch at White's Ferry (19mi).  Snack bar is closed for season.  There are picnic tables to rent -- only $1.50.  Unfortunately, no one was around to take our fee.  The ferry runs all year, though, and boy, is it loud. 2:50pm:  Viaduct at about Milepost (MP) 42 (we started at MP16.6). We had to walk our bikes across.  There were very bad ruts in the packed dirt path for 3 miles north of the viaduct.  Too much sweat! 5:19pm:  Brunswick.  MP55.  Stopping for the night.  Asked direction from car person -- bad idea.  His sense of distance is all out of whack.  Only restaurant not closed on Monday & Tuesday apparently is King's New York Style Pizza.   Only one hotel is here and it is "always booked," according to the locals.  Called George's Mill Bed & Breakfast  (http://www.georgesmill.com).  They're in Virginia, but they sent a truck for us.  That was an awfully nice thing to do.  It kept us from having to camp. 6:00pm:  The B&B is wonderful!  It's an ancient stone house that has been in the family for 8 generations.  Lori's taking a bath and I'm sitting on the porch.  I forgot to get our mileage, but it's something over 40 miles.  I plan to sleep for hours. Finished the book I was reading (Stonehenge).  I don't recommend it.  It's a bit of a slog to get through with little reward for the effort.  I'll leave it on the bookshelf here.  Started Blindness by Henry Green.
The bike shop is closed down.  The owner got lime disease.  We had wanted to get bikes tuned and buy a new spoke wrench.  We had lunch at Blue Moon Cafe.  The hill up from canal to bridge to Shepherdstown is huge (and not really worth it). 7:39 pm:  MP90.9  Camping.  Lots of river traffic.  Met a mushroom hunter.  Travelled 5 miles on a hilly detour.  It was the fastest 5 mi of trip so far.  Dinner was prepackaged dried strogonoff & cilli mac.  Not bad. (Note:  our mileage won't match the mileposts because a) we've gone off-canal a couple of times for food and lodging and whatnot, and b) the mileposts are not exactly a mile apart.  Sometimes they're more, sometimes less.
2:07 pm:  Hancock-MP124  Econolodge is uphill without easy walking access to town, but the town itself is well-situated from paths.  From Ft Frederick to Hancock, we took a paved rail-trail.  The 10 miles of asphalt was nice, but sunny and hot.  This is the most bike-friendly town by far so far.  But the bike shop is closed on Wednesday.  Trying to decide what to do about Cumberland and detours.  We may stay longer.  Late lunch/early dinner at Weaver's.  Great pie.  Odometer works when I clean contacts and press hard to connect.
Will be taking a rest stop here until tomorrow because of the bikes and because we could use the rest.  The gravel is tough on the wrists.   Lori's parents drove up to bring us shoes that Lori ordered and bike maps for Ohio that I had ordered.  Neither had arrived when we left.  It was nice to see someone from home, and I think for Lori to have someone to talk to.  We did laundry and ate every single meal at Weaver's.  Yum-yum. Nothing wrong with our bikes, really, just got them cleaned and tightened.  Boy, the brakes are good now and our wheels are true.
First calamity:  John's chain broke.  We made it all the way to the C&O parking lot across the river from Paw Paw.  On the way up the hill, the chain snapped.  We spent half an hour re-linking the chain.  Half a mile later, it snapped again.  Walked up the rest of the hill to the PawPaw Patch B&B, where we did have a reservation.   The closest bike shop is in Cumberland, but we can't seem to interest anyone in taking us there.  Our cell phones are only sort of working.  Dang, we're in a tight fix. We did walk through the amazing 3000 ft Paw Paw canal tunnel.  It was pretty dark and scary inside.   This chain has made us realise how vulnerable we are.  We're also seeing how much we just expect things to be available.  Imagine a whole town without a taxi service!   
The owner of the Paw Paw Patch B&B was nice enough to give us a ride to Cumberland to get a new chain.  Then, he was extra nice and gave us a ride across the state line.  So we only rode 13mi on the bikes today, but we're a lot further down the trail than we had expected to be. In Meyersdale, the trail starts at a restored train station.  The station has some great model trains.  We spoke with an enthusiast for quite some time before heading off.  Actually, we had to talk longer than we planned because I came up with a flat tire, a tear right through the tread.   First, I patched the hole with a sticky patch, but it didn't hold air.  I replaced the tube with one of our spares and put a dollar bill inside the tire to help cover the hole.  Lori transferred some of the weight to her bike.  Two of the bike shops on our list turned out to not be bike shops (and one was rather snippy about it).  We'll have to wait at least until Ohiopyle to get a tire.  (If there, after all, tomorrow is Sunday.) The trail is pretty rough for about a mile from Meyersdale.  It is mostly large gravel, but after the bridge (great bridge!), the trail is very fine gravel and hard-packed dirt.  The fine gravel is much nicer than the C&O, but there are patches of the large gravel that are destabilizing with our weight and inertia.  The trail has been pretty level, perhaps a might downhill, but this was negated by the headwind-the worst so far.  Feels like a storm is coming.  We saw several waterfalls along the trail.  The benches seem to be well-placed.  We also saw some huge tri-bladed windmills.   Lunch was at a gas station in Garrett.  We are sleeping at the most well-placed lodging on the trip.  It's directly on the trail.  Amazingly, no one else is staying tonight. 7:54 pm: The B&B has a litte porch-side snackbar, so we had burgers for dinner.  Several older locals sat around talking about deaths and lawnmowers. We played Scabble (Lori won).  Some bikers came in with scary stories about the Ft Hill/Confluence detour.
Lunch at The River's Edge.  Very nice and relaxing.  We're sitting on the porch listening to the river flow by. Mile and a half detour around tunnel on trail was no worse than any part of the C&O.  Detour from Ft Hill to Confluence was a nightmare-410 ft climb in a little less than a mile.  We had to walk it.  Then it was 6 miles downhill.  At 30mph, the bikes really wobble.  Yesterday, we met two road bikers on their way up to Meyersdale and back.  They're from Columbus.  One of them caught up to us here.  He lost the other one on the unfinished part of the trail. The other guy showed up after an hour with a torn sidewall. 5:44 pm: Ohiopyle (31mi)   We had to move from room 14 to room 13 because the AC didn't work. Finished Blindness.  It's very artsy, with only a little bit of plot.  His descriptions are fantastic, but the book didn't do much for me.  No books here.   

Lots of bugs today and a bad headwind, but we hope to make it farther today and rest tomorrow. We met the trail manager today.  He was nice, but we complained about the lack of restrooms north of Connellsville.  Connellsville had a nice-looking bike shop right on the trail. 8:08 pm: McKeesport, PA (62.43mi).  Our longest ride yet.  We definitely pushed too hard. The trail just ended in the middle of nowhere.  A kid on a mtn bike gave us horrible directions up huge hills through the woods.  We wound up at some subdivision on the wrong side of the river. A pair of older women argued over directions for us.  They also showed us the swimming pool and pictures of ducks.  After some bad hills, we made it into McKeesport.  Unfortunately, I got us lost again.  After stopping at a gas station, we got back on track and stumbled into the Angel's Inn. It's pretty much a hostel.  We're moving from one room to another because the first one stank (and I broke the bed by sitting on it).  This used to be a convent. McKeesport is a hole.
We're taking a day off because we pushed too hard yesterday.  We'll probably take another day off in 2 days so we can get our bearings and get ready for Ohio.  We'll be near the Pitt airport, so I imagine there'll be some nice hotels there.  Looking forward to some luxury.   It's raining today.  Now that's a nice coincidence.
Short, but scary, urban ride today. Yesterday, we spent so much time driving around in the rented truck that we stayed another night in McKeesport.   I have to give PA thumbs down on drivers and signage.  Drivers do unexpected things and turn left in across your path with no warning.  And all that was while we were in the truck.  We spent a lot of time driving down roads without names or numbers, because the theory seems to be that only the minor streets need signs.  Maybe everyone just knows what the roads are.  I was surprised that this was true even on the US routes. But we did get to take in a movie at a new Loews at the Waterfront.  The Mummy Returns.  (Movie review: If you don't expect much, the movie is pretty funny, but Brendan needs a better script.)  And we got to grab some Indian food and visit a mall.  Picked up The Subtle Knife (Philip Pullman), 2nd in a series that started with The Golden Compass.  (Lori is reading this now.) There are few shoulders here near the city.  We used side streets when we could and I even used a few sidewalks on hills & bridges.  Lori hates that.  The trucks could give us a little more space, if you ask me.  I couldn't get any good pictures of the bad spots. We stopped to talk to a gate guard at Kennywood.  He told us it is the oldest amusement park in the US.  He also threatened to call an ambulance for us.  The park opens tomorrow.
My odometer broke again today.  This time, messing with the contacts did nothing.  So we got new ones for me and Lori.  I figure if one goes out, we'll have the other for backup.  The brand is called Cat Eye. Our bank's web site is temporarily unavailable due to the "apparent financial difficulties" of their ISP.  I wonder how ProcureZone is doing. There is a terrific thunderstorm.
When we got back, we found a fruit and cheese tray left for us by Stacey at the front desk.  She wished us good luck on the bike trip.  That was nice. And we could use luck the way my bike keeps breaking.  We started to clean our bikes and discovered that one of my spokes had broken.  We got out the cool spoke wire kit, but it requires a saw!   So Lori, angel that she is, has ridden -with my rear wheel strapped to the back of her bike-down to the bike shop we stopped at yesterday.  She's wonderful.
Three states in one day!  Lori says that WVa doesn't count, but I say if we went through it, it counts.  We could tell we were in WVa because the five miles were full of night clubs.  And the shoulder went away.  In Ohio, the shoulder comes back, but it's a divided highway. Our first real traffic scare came in East Liverpool.  An idiot pulled out of a gas station into our path almost hitting Lori.  Then another idiot pulled out of the other exit of the same gas station and stopped, blocking the road.  But it is a relief to be in Ohio, even if we did go the wrong way up a huge hill before calling to get good directions to the hotel.  Mapquest's directions to the East Liverpool Motor Lodge are WRONG.  And the motel people failed to mention the big hill up the parking lot to the motel.   The world is just not oriented for bicycles. For those of you playing along at home, we travelled 32.16 miles today-about 3 or 4 on trails, most of the rest on US30, and a couple on East Liverpool streets.  It was pretty hilly with two killer bikable hills, two walking hills, and a 2 mi 7 per cent grade down to the river crossing. My knees are sore and Lori's a bit bruised, but we're less than 20mi from our Ohio bike map route.  The worst part of this has been feeling like we aren't sure where we're going.  We hope the bike route maps will make us feel more secure. 3:23 pm: Called our mothers and grandmother, but none were home.  There's a huge crowd at the special Mother's Day buffet here at the hotel.

Finished The Subtle Knife last night and started Venus (Ben Bova).  It's quite startling to go from the rich narrative of Pullman to the stark storytelling of Bova.  I don't know what Pullman has against God and religious figures, but he is setting up some great battle to come in the next book.  His description is great, and the story hard to put down.  It's a shame that he has set up a false dichotomy:  those who want to help humanity with learning and those who want to submit.  As if a society could exist without  submisssion.  And as if submission could mean anything without knowledge. I can't wait for the last book. 12:33 pm: Lisbon, OH We've stopped at a very nice little library to check our mail.  The library has stained glass and lots of hardwood.  It was erected in 1897.  In E. Liverpool, we rode 2mi to breakfast at Bob Evans.  When we got to the top of a monster hill to get onto US30, we found it prohibitted bikes.  But the nice ladies at a Walmart gave us good directions to Lisbon.  There were gentle hills, mostly, along this route.  I'd hate to have gone the other direction, though. Another chilly morning.  Downhill wind is quite cold after a sweaty uphill.  Some headwind and some sidewind.  We can't be more than 5mi from our maps (Cardinal Trail).   7:45 pm: North Georgetown, OH - 35.5mi I don't know who thought the Cardinal Trail was bikeable, but they were wrong.  The route the Walmart ladies gave us was better.  The hills are unbelievable and the roads are very rough.  It's almost as if someone threw down a bunch of gravel and then poured tar lightly over it.  It makes our hybrids shake something fierce; I'd hate to be on a road bike going down these hills.  I lost count of the number of hills we had to walk. But I will give them this:  the traffic is very light. So I ended the day discouraged.  My knee hurts and I'm tired.  I can't keep doing these hills.  Surely, there's some flat, somewhere.  I'm also disappointed in the maps. We're camping tonight.  The maps implied a camp ground in the wrong place, but advice at a restaurant got us here.  The campground is very nice.  We put our bikes under a pavillion because we heard it might rain tonight.  The skies look clear now, though. When we rolled into the campground, a sign on the way in said "closed mon".  The office & restaurant had a closed sign, too.  We decided to camp anyway and pay in the morning.  As we were looking around at the sites, the owner came out and we were saved!   I hear a woodpecker and other birds and there's even some road noise for Lori.  I also hear either a burro or a choking dog.   Our first dog was today, too.  It was a little yap dog that couldn't even reach our pedals.
Now this is more like what I imagined Ohio to be like-only colder, wetter, and with more oil wells.  The rain started early this morning.  It was gentle and looked like it wasn't going anyplace soon, so after breakfast at the campground's restaurant, we packed up and headed out. The rain continued until a little after lunch.  It continued to be cold and gray, so I didn't get any pictures of the farmland or the little oil wells.  I did take a picture of the little frog that visited our tent this morning. Today was a much better day, and I'm now more confident that we'll get to Indiana.   Especially if the rain stops.
Started off wet, but the rain has stopped now.  We're having lunch at the heavenly hash restaurant. Our Cardinal Trail maps call map 16 rolling farmland, but we didn't get to farms until 2/3 the way across the map.  In Canal Fulton, the road signs take you onto a road called Market St instead of Marshallville St.  It eventually will become Marshallville St, but there is a bridge out.  You can detour around it, but it isn't well-marked and you're a bit nervous because the map doesn't say anything about Market St.  But there seem to be more and more bike route markers as we head west. 4:34 pm: Hampton Inn, Wooster, OH - 33.5mi They greeted us with towels.  Wooster is a nuclear-free zone.  There's a Fazoli's restaurant here! Rain started up again, so we're doing another hotel.  It's supposed to be dry tomorrow, but thunderstorms on Friday.  The wind started about 5mi before the end--hope that'll push the rain out. Had a jerk drive behind me on a hill holding his horn button down today. Pretty farms this afternoon.  Too bad about the weather-this'd make some nice pictures. For those of you playing along at home, these are the towns and townlets we passed through.  Some of these are not much more than cross-roads:  north canton, canal fulton, marshallville, madisonburg, wooster. 5:12 pm: Interesting note:  I've been selected for jury duty.  I'm supposed to appear 12 July.  Hmmmm. 9:49 pm: I guess Wednesday is our movie day.  We went to see the worst movie of the year--A Knight's Tale.  It started with We Will Rock You, moved to Golden Years, and ended with American Thighs.  Can you name  those artists?  If so, you're too old for this movie. The theater was something else.  Neon everywhere.  The bathrooms had black and white diagonal striped doors, black and white square wall tiles, and green and purple stalls.  It made me motion sick.
I'm willing (though reluctant) to ride in rain, but fog is too dangerous.  No rain this morning, but the fog is pretty thick, even this late.  I thought we were going to do some real riding today, but that doesn't seem to be playing out.  And it's supposed to rain again this afternoon and tomorrow. Lori didn't sleep well last night. 9:49 pm: Rm412, Holiday Inn, Mansfield, OH - 36.49mi It was a 3 dog day.  Just west of Jeromesville, 3 dogs came after us all at once.  Neither of us was bitten, but these dogs were very scary.  They were quite irritating.  And that was a shame because in Jeromesville we met the nicest folks so far.  Two women at J'ville Pub & Grill were very interested in our trip.  They wanted to feed us, but we weren't hungry yet.  They tried to give us sandwiches, but I really wanted to get on the road since we got such a late start today.  They qave us a tshirt and a sweatshirt.  They also gave us their number in case we got caught in the rain.  An offer of a pickup is going to be hard to beat. Though it threatened through the day, we made it all the way without any rain.  Instead, it was hazy and humid.  We had to stop and clean our glasses fairly often.   We learned two valuable lessons about maps today:  We left Wooster and headed west.  Instead of going back north 5mi to meet the trail where we left it yesterday, we thought we'd meet it as it came south on the west side of Wooster.  We rode 9mi of the hilliest road since North Georgetown.  We were exhausted almost immediately. But we perservered and made it to yet another depressing steel town.  We did have a nice dinner at a nearby dive, though.  We left the Cardinal Trail today (map 14 has a typo) and started on Trail K.  K will take us to Indiana and the Adventure Cycling maps.    
Short day today.  The rain came on harder than we expected.  And the flat tire (Calamity no. 4) didn't help.  Now I've had flats front and rear.   How come none of these calamities happens to Lori?  Actually, I'd rather they happen to me.  And either way, we're both stopped. Well, the tube's been replaced (it was stuck to the tire), but the rain really made it hard to see-and to be seen.  This old motel on the old Lincoln hiway is our first seedy stay.  The knobs on the shower are mislabeled, and there is no bath tub.  But it's dry, and there's a restaurant next door. There was another unplanned (and not well-signed) detour today.  No idea what was going on, but part of Millsboro Road was closed (bike route K, map 32).  We had to bike about 3mi off-route.  We had to guess how best to get back on the route. 
Beautiful riding day.  Whenever we were headed east or south, we had a tailwind.  I can't imagine flatter land.  That's nice because it means we can afford to take detours.   It was also nice because I broke another spoke.  We spent a lot of time trying to put in a new one, but we just couldn't manage it.  The spoke that broke was one that attaches to the cassette side (gear side) of the rear wheel.  There seems to be no way to get a new spoke in there without removing the cassette. Bud Miller confirmed this for us.  We hobbled about ten miles into Upper Sandusky without the spoke (I adjusted some of the remaining spokes to make the wheel straighter-at least enough to keep the rim from hitting the brakes).  After we checked in, I called Bud Miller's bicycle shop and asked for his hours.  He told me he closed at 3.  I had called at 3.30!   But he said he'd drive out to the hotel and pick up the wheel. In fact, he took us back to his shop and replaced the spoke, cleaned out the axle, and trued the wheel.  He also told us biking stories-he was head of GOBA (Greater Ohio Bicycling Adventure) for several years. We also had stopped earlier to fool with Lori's front derailleur.  Her chain had been rubbing.  It seems okay now. I think we could have made 60 or 70 miles without the mechanical difficulties.  Oh, well.  Tomorrow will be a short day, too, because we want to take the next day off to avoid the thunderstorms (and to go to a bookstore, etc).  So we'll probably stop by Bud's church, too.  (He told us that when he heard we were from DC, he was worried we'd be liberals.  We told him that, well, hey, I mean we are from DC after all.) We took the opportunity to get some pictures developed and to play miniature golf. 
Took in a service at a very friendly church in Upper Sandusky.  The folks at Trinity Evangelical Methodist church really made us feel like family. The weather was beautiful for our ride today.  Of course, we're both a bit sunburned.   We rode into Findlayfrom the south and had to bike north and west to find a hotel.  But the hotel is very nice and we look forward to a day off tomorrow.  We need to hit a bike shop and a book shop.  There's a hundred per cent chance of thunderstorms tomorrow.  Rain is one thing lightning quite another.  Of course, there's rain scheduled for the next week (and highs in the low 50s!), but no lightning. Still, we can't really camp with this wetness, so we may have to figure out an alternate route for the week. 6:27 pm:  Forgot to mention the dogs.  There were several today.  Many pretty much stayed in their yards.  A very big St Bernard barked at us, but he couldn't be bothered to move.  I think he was trying to pretend to be a dog, but he's really just a bear. But we had 3 dogs come out of their yards at different points today.  One was an Irish setter.  He had a little trouble keeping his balance on newly cut grass.  I watched him run alongside Lori, barking up a storm.  Then, he slipped on the grass and hit the ground-boom!-all four legs flying.  So when I rode by, he came into the road. A loudly shouted "back!" seems to keep them from getting too close, but the adrenaline does get pumping. 

The towns are just not placed properly.  We're going to stop here and then leave the K trail to go join the Adventure Cycling maps in Paulding.  This takes us north only to come south again, but it seems our best bet with the wind and threat of rain. We were off-route the whole day.  We took US224 all the way from Findlay.  It was quite a joy to see the wind batter and push away the clouds.  The blue slowly spread across the sky.  Unfortunately, it meant we spent the whole ride fighting a relentless headwind.  It was like riding uphill. So I made up a song about the wind.  Imagine this with an Irish lilt: Hear the wind blowing, It's calling your name. Hey, Lori!  Hey, Johnny! Hear the wind blowing, It's taunting your name. Hey Lori & Johnny, go home! Well, we laugh at the wind And we laugh at the rain, We laugh at our butts 'Cause we laugh at the pain. We ride through the day and we sleep through the night We see people thinking, "Hey, they're not too bright." Hear the wind blowing, It's calling your name. Hey, Lori!  Hey, Michael! Hear the wind blowing, It's taunting your name. Hey Lori & Michael, go home! We ride through the highlands,  We ride through the low. We sometimes ride fast And sometimes quite slow. When trucks pass us by They cause quite a fright,  But they cancel the wind So I guess that's all right. Oh! Hear the wind... 4:35 pm:  Rm 9, Lee Bell Motel, Ottawa, OH - 25.5mi Hey, you can't beat $37 a night. 
We raced the rain and won.  The morning started beautifully, but the wind can beat you down.  The wind and the fear of rain were enough to bring us here-not to mention our sore bottoms.  The options were 40 miles here or 65 to Indiana.  We chose here.  But we'll easily make Indiana tomorrow-only 35mi to the next hotel. We had to turn north 10 miles back to get to the hotel.  The tailwind was nice, we easily got to 20mph without a hill.  Too bad the first 30mi was into the wind (winds out of SW today). The terrain continues to be flat.  We pass large fields with young wheat or corn plants.  The wheat is a good two feet tall, but the corn is only a few inches.  So you can still see a lot of dirt in the corn fields, but none between stalks of wheat. The little towns we pass through between large ones are generally just 10 or 15 houses spread around a large intersection and a couple of side streets.  Once in a while, they'll have a gas station, but there are no hotels between Ottawa and Paulding (neither of which has a AAA-rated lodging), and we did see two restaurants, but they were closed. We passed a few mounds (probably built by what the phone book calls "the county's first settlers, prehistoric mound builders").  We had one dog encounter today, but it's hard to take weiner dogs seriously.  He did give it the old college try, though, running into the road as fast as his little legs would carry him. 
We have crossed the state line! Wind is bad.  Rain is worse.  Together, they are terrible.  We spent the morning in a steady downpour, riding into a headwind.  Crossing the state line got rid of the rain, but we're, even now, still cold & wet. This is the first motel that's been dirty. Everyone in Monroeville was very friendly.
We raced the rain today and lost.  West of Zanesville, we took refuge on the porch of a house under construction.  We shivered for about an hour as it hailed and then rained.  There was a good thunder & lightning show.   It was also a big dog day.  I lost count of them.  It started with a dalmatian and a chihuahua. The dalmatian gave up pretty quickly, but the chihuahua caught up to us. Poor thing couldn't reach us. The other dogs were scarier.  There was one pair with puppies to protect.  They ganged up on us with real skill.  We haven't been bitten yet, but I'm ready to get a weapon.  I know it's the owners' fault, but they're not around when we're being threatened.  Hurrah for cats. I'm so sick of rain. Now that we're on the Adventure Cycling maps, we're finding that folks are more used to cyclists.  There have been so many that the postmistress made little postcards for them.  A mini-mart owner keeps a little cyclist guestbook.   On the one hand, it's nice to see that the route is doable.  On the other, I miss the sense of awe that folks have been showing us.

I am tired of complaining about the rain. We're having trouble putting our hands on the point of it all.  Why are we putting ourselves through this? Peru is the home of Cole Porter and the circus hall of fame.  As the rain let up, we tried to walk to dinner.  When the rain picked up, we took refuge on a porch.  After dinner we saw a rainbow-God's promise that he won't drown us on this bicycle trip.  Maybe he'll get us  with a tornado instead.  One was spotted north of here-the route we were scheduled to take.  We're on a shortcut-US24. The B&B is a huge home from the 19th century.  There are lots of books in a panelled room with a fireplace.  There are also antique toys.  We aren't actually in the house.  Instead, we are in the carriage house, above our bikes.  The tub is huge.
Rain. Two men spend half an hour every morning praying, reading Psalms and chanting.  The sanctuary of the Anglican Catholic Church of the Trinity is otherwise empty for Mattins (or Matins).  It is a reflective time. This was followed by a liturgical service - with six women in attendance.  I was the only guy in the congregation.  It was very formal, incense, holy water (it didn't burn me!), and all.   The bell is named Benedict.  The rector is from Oxen Hill, MD. Monticello is the home of Indiana's oldest amusement park.  We have not yet seen it.  We are on the banks of a lake created by damming the Tippecanoe River.   We've been in Alvin Maker territory for some time, but we haven't met anyone with a knack yet.  (Orson Scott Card fans will understand the reference.) We spent another day off-route. 

The paper say, "Partly Sunny-No Rain, Not Even Tonight!" 5:03 pm: The White House B&B, Rensselaer, IN - 34.5mi Lori and I were discussing the relative merits of urban and non-urban living as we were riding along.  I was defending - can you imagine? - the rural life, extolling its quiet and safety, when someone in a blue and white van threw a AA battery at me.  It caught me on the back of my head right under the helmet.  I was a little dazed for a second.  I'm okay.  I came away with a small cut and will probably get a little lump. It's always good when your cynicism is restored. On the other hand, a bit later we stopped to take a picture of a broken-down school.  John Eaton came running out to say hello.  The school had closed in the '60s.   Then it became a church where his father had been a pastor.  Now, John lives in a trailer behind the school and hopes to some day have the money to tear it down. He has helped lots of x-country bikers and runners.  He offered us a bed for the night, but we really wanted to get farther west.  And we were looking forward to a nice B&B. This is definitely a nice B&B.  The tub is huge.  The owners are a psychologist and a professor at the local college (not RPI, can you believe it?).  They're expecting a grandchild, but they put us up any way.  They'll have to run off at any moment to watch the other kid.
We expect to ride into Illinois tomorrow, rent a truck, and drive to Chicago.  We'll take a real break there and decide how and whether we'll go on.
My bicycle has 24 gears, in 3 sets of 8.  (Octaves!)  Today was the first day on the whole trip that I was consistently able to use the highest octave.  (Hey, I have an idea-a symphony based on how I changed gears during the trip.)  The tailwind definitely helped us get the first 38 miles in before noon.  After lunch, though, we started north and had to fight the wind. We started the morning at Janet's Kitchen (the B&B's grandchild finally called them away, so there was no breakfast), but we didn't sit at the reserved table.  It was reserved for "farmers, golfers, fishers, and other liars."  Several locals sat there giving each other a hard time.  One tried to sell us a car. We stopped for our snack in Beaverville.  This small town has a huge Catholic church.  It is impressive, with beautiful stained glass. 
Finished Lives of the Monster Dogs, by Kirsten Bakis.  It's the story of a group of people who, through mysterious operations, give dogs artificial hands, mechanical voice boxes, and intelligence.  The idea is to make an army of soldiers, but the dogs rebel and massacre their creators in their hidden Canadian outpost.  Then, the dogs show up in New York and become celebrities. There's a great similarity between this book and the novel Frankenstein.  Ultimately, though, I'm just not drawn into the story.  It's obvious that the narrator cares very much for the dogs.  She has a close friendship with one, and a strong attachment to another.  It was never really clear to me why she cared.  There was too much telling, nt enough showing. I think that not engaging me emotionally kept the book from inspiring me to think too deeply on its themes:  what is humanness?  What is loyalty? Etc.  -Tales of the Wayside Inn, Longfellow 
Rode around a pond/lake to stretch.  This area of Chicagoland has some very nice paved bike trails.  They pretty much have to; the streets are terrible.  Most of them are under construction.  They are all falling apart-chunks of concrete everywhere.   We're spending a wonderful time with our friends Saundra and Paula.  We get to play games tonight!  They are trying to get us addicted to the television series called Buffy the Vampire Slayer.
 
Well, we're nearing the end of our stay with Saundra & Paula.  The week has been very relaxing.  They took us to play miniature golf.  We even got to buy some jeans and hang around all week wearing denim.  And the pickup truck was fun. You cannot imagine the joy of regular clothing.   They introduced us to the Schaumburg library.  It's a new one with something like three dozen web terminals and two hours of access time.  Unfortunately, they kick you off after two hours, whether or not  someone is waiting. They let us play with their two cats and a chihuahua.  (We've forgiven them for owning a dog.)  They cooked us very good food.  They took us to the movies and to Mars 2112, a space-themed restaurant. And, best of all, it pretty much rained off-and-on all week.  Anything's better than riding in that junk. But we're getting antsy, so we'll move north tomorrow.  This, in spite of the forecast morning rain.  This cannot go on forever, right? Right?  Before we stopped here, we had been contemplating our next steps.  The unending rain, lack of progress, and general homesickness had gotten us down.  Before we got to Peru, we had little contact with real people (day after day of motel receptionists). And this week, I was called by a headhunter in London who told me that the job market completely disappears in August. But we have decided to ride for another month.  If you want to know why, tune in tomorrow.
 We dropped off the truck at 1pm or so, after visits to the post office and a restaurant.  Then we headed north.  The majority of the riding today was bicycle trail.  About half was paved, the rest fine stone.  We took our last 5mi on a Wisconsin road.  Looks like we're back in rolling country. The trails started off in nice neighborhoods, went through a fantastic neighborhood, followed by a rundown neighborhood, then switched to farmland as we got furthest north.  The trail did a lot of at-grade road crossings, and there was a lot of broken glass.  But it was nice to be off-road again, even for just a day. We could tell we were in Wisconsin because right over the line was the first person to return our cheery greeting. Once again MapQuest steered us wrong in getting to the hotel.  But we made it here safely.  Now we can eat.  8:32 pm: So why are we continuing?  It's hard to truly pin it down, but I'll try.  Our disappointment was really a reflection of our personalities.  Forgive me for going Meyers-Briggs on you, but Lori and I are both INFPs.  MB categorizes folks by their personalities using four letters. ( I think it's pretty unusual for a couple to have all the same letters.) The "P" tells you that we are comfortable with change and with not really having a schedule.  I think that Ps are likely to decide to do things on a whim-sort of like this trip. The "I" tells you we are introverts.  That's great for biking because we spend an awful lot of time alone, or at least unable to talk, while riding. So why did we get depressed.  Sure, the weather had a lot to do with it.  But deep down I think it has to do with that "NF"-in two ways.  First, there is this great attraction to causes for NFs.  The "whatever" attitude of the first few weeks is overtaken by the need for purpose. Second, the NF means that we're loyal and need human connection.  We strongly believe in the idea of community, and yet we voluntarily cut ourselves off from it on this bicycle trip.  Hence the homesickness. So what should we do, give up?  Well, I hesitate to do that for several reasons.  First and foremost, I feel like I have a tendency to not finish projects like this.  And this is only a few months of our lives.  This is something we may never have the chance to do again. How do we go on without a purpose?  Well, really, we have our purposes.  We just need to better articulate them so we can grab on to them even in the rain, and, more important, we need to consciously do things to work towards those purposes. One example is something that goes hand-in-hand with working on the homesickness.  I want to meet people and see how they tick.  If I can, I'd like to see how communities have formed and grown.  The Adventure Cycling maps tend to take you away from population centers.  Couple that with our tendency to stay in motels, and you see how we'll never meet anyone real. So, we're going to do our own navigating through Wisconsin to Minneapolis.  Now that June is here, we'll pass more community picnics.  We'll plan our route to go through small towns.  We'll sleep at B&Bs when possible.  And we'll take the time to walk around the towns, really see them. We realized some time ago that we don't have time to make it to Seattle, so now we're just aiming for whereever. We have others,too, and those will come up as we go along.  We also, by the way, came to understand that we are not completely isolated.  All of your postings, emails, and even phone calls have helped us to remember that you're all beside us, looking over our shoulders.  Thanks. And please don't stop. 
morning sun afternoon grumpy clouds comfortable winds equally divided terrain: rolling to hilly  But it was nice, nonetheless.  The land usage has been more varied than in the vowel states.  Animal farms mixed with crop farms mixed with orchards, suburbs, and forests.  It's beautiful, but the hills are coming to get us. I blew a spoke when we got to Waterford, but it was on the easy side of the rear wheel.  I replaced it fairly easily.  That felt good. We can hear the country act that was playing for the fair.  It's mixed with the rock coming from a neighbor's radio.  There is also, from time-to-time, the church bell. It sounds like a door bell.  Ding dong. We did talk for a while with a retired nurse at a tavern outside Rochester.  She moved here from Iowa.  She hurt her knee waterskiing, but she still does it.  She won't bicycle, though. 
morning sun afternoon Toy Story clouds wind negligible warm terrain: hilly-2 walkers  We stopped at a petting farm.  We petted goats, llamas, baby ducks, and baby rabbits.  We only looked at the turkeys and chickens.  The place was full of kids.  For many, it was the last day of school. We didn't get to see the trolleys in East Troy, because our route took us through the wrong part of town.  We had a picnic lunch on the steps of a Methodist church in Troy Center (a different, smaller town). (It turns out that Troy is named after the city in New York.)  New distance includes 3mi round trip to Old World Wisconsin for the all-you-can eat fish fry (I had the baked chicken).  Old World Wisconsin is a Williamsburg wannabe.  Folks are dressed in 19th century garb; there are cow barns everywhere.  The only thing we saw was the restaurant in the basement of an octagonal barn-the rest was closed.   
morning mostly sunny afternoon mostly cloudy warm strong headwind terrain: hilly (no walkers), flat on trail  We rode through Kettle Moraine State Forest.  It was a beautiful ride.  Part looked like a miniature version of New Mexico's Calderra.  A huge flat circular valley ringed by hills.  Of course, in NM it's a dormant volcano.  Here, glaciers did the landscaping. We joined the Glacial Drumlin Trail in Sullivan.  As far as I can tell, a drumlin is a ripple in the prairie caused by melting underneath a glacier.  The seven or eight miles we spent on the trail wound through marshland and spooky forest. In Wisconsin, the state trails require a pass.  Daily passes are $3, and annual passes are $10.  That's not a bad deal, I suppose.  We purchased our annual passes from a Sullivan grocer who told us Wisconsin mosquito jokes (which sound remarkably similar to Alaskan mosquito jokes). The owner of the Jefferson B&B is having an operation, so we're in a motel tonight.  Tomorrow's a light day so that we can look at pottery. We saw a deer farm. 
grumpy clouds laced with rain sprinkles  late afternoon sun strong head/side winds terrain: rolling to hilly (no walkers)  It meant that we had plenty of time to see the pottery festival and watch the US pottery games.  Today was the high school competition.  They were short a contestant, so they asked for a volunteer to join and show how hard it was. Lori volunteered. The five contestants sat on a flatbed trailer with electric wheels and lumps of clay.  They competed to see wh could make the highest cylinder from 5 pounds of clay and the widest plate from the same amount.  Lori's cylinder came in 4th.  She was given a coach who said that she didn't make the same mistakes that most first-timers make.  She got a lot of applause and a free t-shirt. I sat in the crowd thinking, "That's my wife up there!"    
 
sunny hot no wind terrain: hilly  In Hope, we passed the Hope Evangelical Cemetary.  I don't know how successful evangelism can be in a graveyard, but more power to 'em. We rode into Madison this afternoon.  The sun was blasting down on our heads, so it was nice to stop at a lemonade stand east of the city.  The girls had just graduated kindergarten, but they hadn't gotten as much money as the sister who graduated high school. Guess they were hoping to make up the difference with the profits from their stand. Madison has a nice approach for bicyclists along paved bicycle paths.  Unfortunately, some of the signs are rather confusing.  For example, one sign told us that the bike route went straight ahead.  Or, it turned to our left.  Or, it turned to our right.  A little arrow indicating how to get downtown would have been nice. We made our way downtown without getting lost (though I do think we took the long way).  The city sits on an isthmus between two sparkling blue lakes.  The bike path takes you along one, and there are bike routes and bike lanes throughout.   There are more bicycles in this city than I have seen anywhere before.  Folks were riding many of them, but many were scattered about on lawns, on balconies, and in bike racks. It was a good place, I guess, to blow another spoke.  I blew another cassette-side spoke, and we had to tootle down to the bike shop to get a repair.  The shop was so big and busy that we didn't even get to do our cross-country biking shtick. But we did get the spoke fixed. 
overcast muggy strong headwind terrain: hilly (2 walkers) to rolling  There's something exciting about these powerful storms.  This is mostly true only when they're at night and we're safe, warm, and dry in a hotel room. We meandered through Madison trying to make our way out of the city.  The bike lanes are wonderful.  The hills on the edge of town are not. We stopped at Culver's-Home of the Butter Burger-for lunch.  The stuffed taco did not agree with my stomach.   Mazomanie means "walking iron" in the Dakota Sioux language.  I guess there was a travelling dry cleaner here once upon a time. 
sunny hot strong side wind terrain:  flat, slightly downhill  We stopped to watch cheese being made and to see animals in pens behind a farmer's market.  There were prairie dogs, deer, alligators, goats, burros, pea hens & cocks, pheasants, fish, and who knows what all. I'm glad it was a short day, because I don't feel well.  I'm going to bed. 
Today is an off day.  Jay took us over and dropped us off at the House on the Rock.  We spent two hours walking through pile after pile of tacky junk.  And we paid $40 for the privilege.  The guy must have been short.   Kelly came to get us.  She showed us the Lloyd Wright family chapel.  We rode by Taliesin-Frank Lloyd Wright's home and the home of his architecture apprenticeship program.  We missed the tour there, and it started raining any way.  Kelly dropped us off at Rumbleseats, a drive-in restaurant with indoor seating. There are a lot of structures around here with the Frank Lloyd Wright look.  Beating up the guy in the gorilla costume was funny, though.   After some work, we got the gift shop woman to call the B&B to come get us early (we, of course, were not allowed to touch the phone).  Thank you very much Jay & Kelly for driving us all over creation today. At least we got new t-shirts.
mostly cloudy warm strong headwind terrain: flat, then hilly dogs: 1  Kelly and Jay made running a B&B look fun.  Maybe we'll move to Wisconsin and open one ourselves.  It sure is beautiful here. We chose this route because of a special deal we saw on the internet.  Three B&Bs offer to carry our bags, give us directions, and let us sleep.  They're 25-30 miles apart, which matches our rate well. We had a wonderful day without having to carry our stuff!  When we got here, our panniers and stuff were waiting.  This will be especially nice as we head into hilly territory tomorrow.   We rode through flat valleys ringed by hills before stopping for lunch at a cafe at the little airport.  The corn is getting taller and everything is very green. After the airport, we had our first loose Wisconsin dog, but he stayed off the road.  We hit a very large hill, but over all it would have been an easy trip if not for the wind. We hope it keeps up tomorrow because we're switching to northeast. 
sunny hot variable winds terrain: hilly (1 walker) dogs: 5  Two guests at the Lamb's Inn B&B, Jim and Deena, are bicycle enthusiasts.  They come to Richland Center (from Minneapolis) several times a year to bike around.  Jim and Deena were nice enough to take us out for dinner last night.  And they gave us a lot of advice this morning. I think they have a different idea of what makes a big hill than we do. Here in Reedsburg, we've decided to skip the butter festival in favor of seeing a movie.  Reedsburg has a fairly good sized main street, but its library closed at 1.  We are also missing out on the Norman Rockwell museum. We rode through some really hilly farmland today.  The views were great, but we'll be ready for the flatness of tomorrow's trails.  We have over 100 miles of trail to the Mississippi River, so it won't be long before we're ready to switch back tv roads.  Atlantis also falls into one of Shrek's traps.  I think the voices are too recognizably famous, to the detriment of creating the characters.  It's also kind of eery to hear Jim Varney's voice. The theater had some trouble with the sound system, so they gave us free tickets.  Since we're only here for the day, we went to see Tomb Raider. All I'll say about this movie is that it raises so many more questions than it answers:   
sunny hot slight headwind terrain: the trail is flat, there are hills all around  Both trails are crushed limestone and dirt.  At times, it was much like the C&O--no roots, but hard-packed dirt, rocky outcroppings, and standing water.   Elroy has a bicycle center along the trail.  You can even take a shower! Talked to my father today for a few minutes.  The phone card ran out of money and the cell phones aren't in range.  Hope you had a good father's day, Dad. 
 
morning rain afternoon sun warm no wind terrain: long slight ups and very long slight downs  The Elroy-Sparta trail is the nicest one we've been on.  There's a good variation to the things to see, and the trail is broken up by 3 tunnels.  They are 1/4, 1/4, and 3/4 mile long.  In the middle of the last, you cannot see either end.  It's kinda spooky, but a husband & wife (and their son, Sawyer) walked through with us, keeping us company. Today was a laundry and library day.  The B&B owner was very concerned that we not get dirt on her Oriental rugs.  Truth be told, we were pretty muddy from the trails, although it (the trail) drained very well and there was no standing water.  Sparta claims to be the bicycle capital of America, but it isn't clear why.  Elroy has more trails; Waterloo manufactures Treks; Madison had better bicycle access to the city.  Sparta's roads are cracking concrete, and there are no bike lanes. Sparta does have a giant statue of a cyclist. 
sunny warm (cooier than yesterday) slight headwind terrain: flat (through valleys. marshland outside Onalaska) bugs  The trailheads tend to have information about the towns and businesses.  At the end of the LaCrosse River trail, the posted map implied that we would pass nice places on the Great River trail. Well, we did pass them (I assume), but we never saw them up the hill and on the other side of the trees.  Feeling like we'd gone too far, we climbed out of the trail up a big hill to ask.  We had to come back a mile to find this dump. The trail was nice, though.  In contrast to yesterday, the trail was open and the views great.  Up to today, everywhere to eat has been a dingy bar.  Although that has a certain appeal, we get tired of the same thing over and over.  Today had a very nice soda shop in Bangor. We had a 4-course breakfast in Sparta.  It was very good.  As we left Sparta, we had to navigate through a swarm of rugrats on bikes.  They're worse than the gnats. I lost my gloves at the library in Sparta.   Today, a ranger finally asked to see our passes. Major thunderstorms last night. Wild life (not including cows): doves, red winged blackbirds, some kind of long-tailed chipmunk, rabbits, crows  Our current goal is to get to Minneapolis and then find a small town to celebrate the 4th of July. 
sunny warm BUGGY  Stupid bike. We finally biked into Minnesota, crossing the great Mississippi.  In climbing the bridge, I forgot to get a picture of the "Welcome to Minnesota" sign. The trail was full of bugs.  Most of the way was through swamp.  There were some nice prairie flowers, I suppose. We've left the off-road trails for a while. I forgot to mention the scary, big ugly sun perch statue outside our Onalaska motel.  I guess Onalaska is the sun perch capital of America. This place is nice; we have a whirlpool suite.  Cats tomorrow! 
cloudy cool 15 minutes of cold, soaking rain very strong headwind hilly (no walkers)  The river smells. We have seen a couple of dams, but the water seems to be the same level on either side.  Perhads Dad can tell us if that's on purpose or due to the immense amount of rain they've gotten up here.  We passed some idle Corps of Engineers dredgers, too. US61 is a divided highway, with speed limits as high as 65.  The shoulders are nice and wide.  There is a lot of traffic, but no bugs or dogs.  A bird did follow me menacingly for a while.  Anderson House is an inn with 40 or so rooms.  Apparently, it is the oldest continually operating hotel west of the Mississippi.  The beds are tiny, as is the bath tub (no shower).  The room is a good size, though. Wabasha is home of the Grumpy Old Men movies.  We ate at Slippery's, home of the Beeping Waitress and the Slamming Door.  Lori had to go get water for us.  I'm looking forward to dessert here in the hotel. 
We're sitting under a bridge listening to a jazz quartet.  The bridge carries the Laura Ingalls Wilder Highway over the Mississippi.   I think Laura's Pa just drove them over the ice on their way to Oklahoma. There's a free concert here every Friday night.  It seems to be well-attended.  The kids are getting down with their funky, bad selves.  The sky is blue and it's only slightly cool.   It's been a very relaxing day off.  We visited a book store and read all day.   Lori picked up a book by a local writer (Bogtrotter, by Richard Coffey), Little House on the Prairie, and Prelude to Foundation (Asimov).  Back in Winona, she finished Foundation.   I've read the original Foundation series, but never this one.  I finished my book in Winona, too, and I wanted to be able to talk intelligently to Alwood, so when Lori wasn't looking, I snatched it.  I'm about halfway through--what a great day! We've been assigned a new cat because Ginger was already reserved for tonight.  We don't know what this one's name is.  We were calling it Throw Pillow because it's not nearly as demandingly affectionate or active as Ginger and because it's so big and long-haired.  We think it's a mancoon. Now we are calling it Pukey because when we came up from dinner we discovered that it had thrown up on the floor.  Oh, well, I guess that's what you get with long hair.  Lori now suggests calling it Throw-up Pillow. Every band should give up singing "I Lost My Heart in San Francisco."  I mean, it's a perfectly good song, but no matter how good the singer is, he or she always comes off sounding like a bad lounge singer. 
sunny warm slight tailwind hilly (no walkers)  The Mississippi is starting to become monotonous.  It's a nice river and all, but all the towns look alike.  They're skinny gatherings of buildings squeezed between the river and the bluffs.  Some are bigger than others, and they're all friendly enough. Note how easily I make unreasonable generalizations based on little evidence. While Lori napped (the cat meowed all night and the lunchtime burger didn't agree with her stomach at all), I finished Prelude to Foundation.  The book does a good job tying together Asimov's Foundation and Robot series.  It's a fun (if not completely surprising) romp in the old-fashioned science fiction style.  It also gives us a better glimpse of Hari Seldon.  Unfortunately, I didn't like Hari.  This isn't much of a surprise; I rarely care about Asimov's people.  But I thought Hari was a bit too naive, and at times a jerk. Similar to Orson Card with Ender's Shadow, I felt that Asimov spent a book recreating his hero as somehow less and as somewhat less of a prime mover in his own history than was indicated by previous stories.  In a way, that's admirable, or at least a little more realistic.  But one shouldn't be surprised when we're disappointed in the revealed humanity of our heroes after-the-fact. On-the-other-hand, Seldon still has no character flaws, and who wouldn't like a gentle nudge of encouragement once in a while?  
overcast hot 16mi sidewind; 8mi tailwind; remainder neutral hilly to rolling (1 hill was 3mi long)  Hastings was home to a spiral bridge, but it has been gone since the '50s. Helped a woman decide how to paint her house. Restaurant had a model train around the dining area, but it is broken. Can't seem to get good advice from Minnesota bike shops concerning routes.  No one has maps.  The innkeeper has tried to be helpful. 

sunny hot hilly, highway & suburban good tailwind  We had to be careful at a point where three cop cars hogged the shoulder.  A fourth was across the highway.  They had pulled over a little old lady. 19 had less traffic but there was some construction. We stopped to shower and rent a car (they tried pawn a Saturn off on us).  So ends the unsupported part of our trip.  It's sort of anti-climatic. Lori's parents are going to drive up to meet us here.  Then, we'll drive up to Duluth and ride with her father east across Wisconsin to find a place to see a small-town  fourth of July.  Lori's mom will be handling the sag wagon. We rode around the Twin Cities looking for a Thai or Indian restaurant.  We failed and ate at a Somali restaurant.  The A/C was broken. We had to stop in at the Mall of America.  It is certainly huge.  There aren't a lot of malls with a roller coaster.  Oh, and we found a fair bike map in the Barnes & Noble. 
A week ago, a tornado hit this town and ripped it apart.  We've heard that in places the tornado was nearly a mile wide.  It's hard to believe that from what we've seen.  But the general devastation is pretty hard to believe,too. We read in the paper that volunteers were still needed, so we drove up and joined the crowd. It seems disorganized.  A red-haired woman is complaining about unself-motivated volunteers.  The bus took us to a drop-point, but no one was there to tell us what to do.  We shuffled around a yard, separating natural waste from manufactured waste.   We munched on lunch. Then, the bus came back because we had been left at the wrong spot.  Now we're at the fire tower waiting for someone to show up to tell us what to do. There are about 25 of us. 12:52 pm: The bus came back.  Now, we're heading to the real drop point.  (Or so we're told.)  We'll be picking up debris from a hayfield. 6:08 pm: St. Paul, MN Gosh the soft bed feels nice.  I'll bet the shower will feel good, too, though we both got a good deal of sun. The family's house was gone.  They had spent the storm safely in the basement.  They're living in a camper while their house gets re-built.  The contractors were throwing up walls pretty quickly. In the hayfield, we started off fairly organized in spite of the fact that the complaining redhead didn't join us.  We formed a line and started combing the field, using trash bags for the smaller bits of sheetrock, wood, and roofing material.  We carried larger things (boards, window frames, small trees, chunks of chimney) to a pile off the field.  When we found things that might be salvagable (glass birds, napkin holders), a young girl named Sarah carried them up to the family for inspection. Fairly quickly, though, our line fell apart.  The trash bags tore pretty easily and it never felt like we were making progress.  So we started making smaller piles in the field, clearing circles around them.  Some of us found buckets, and someone found a wheelbarrow.  The rest of us built up the piles or helped transfer them to the big one by hand-carrying larger pieces. We met folks from St. Cloud, MN (Mike and Kasey), a den mother and boy scouts from Houston, and others.  Mike kept us entertained with constant banter. I think we helped, some, but the field needed another pass or two even when we left.  Since it's been a week, I suppose, the community seemed to be handling it pretty well.  At least, the family we worked for was in good spirits.   Although it seemed pretty disorganized at first, I think they had it pretty together considering that a disaster had struck and all.   8:15 pm: Finally, good food.  We had some excellent Indian cuisine at a place in a strip mall.  I am so stuffed.
Around 1, the phone woke me.  It was the housekeeping staff wanting to know if the do not disturb sign meant I didn't want to be disturbed.
1.  We were awakened last night by the sound of a vaccuum cleaner in the hallway.  It started and stopped, started and stopped.  Finally, I poked my head out the door.  An employee holding a vaccuum cleaner smiled at me.   "Can I help you?" he asked. "What's going on," I said. "Nothing." "Nothing!?" I exclaimed. "You're vaccuuming in the middle of the night!" "Does that bother you?  I'm sorry." I shut the door and got back into bed.  Lori called the front desk. "Could you tell the housekeeping staff not to vaccuum in the middle of the night?" she asked. "Oh, that's not housekeeping," came the reply.  "That's maintenance.  He probably just forgot to do it earlier." 2.  We stopped in at Cracker Barrel for breakfast.  We had some problem figuring out how to get to it, so we were quite hungry.  We ordered breakfast, and the waitress brought us drinks.  I went outside to get the papers (we have to get both local newspapers to get as many comics as the Post).  We read through both sets of comics. No food arrived.  Our waitress had disappeared.  After half an hour of waiting, we flagged down another waitress to see what was going on.  She got the manager, who came over. We needed our food.  Maybe an apology would have been nice, too.  Instead, we got an explanation. "Your waitress had to go to computer class," she said.  "Another server was supposed to help you." We told her we just wanted our food.  Finally, they brought out our meal.  They took off the price of our drinks from our tab.  Pretty nice of them considering it was nobody's fault.
The eight miles came from a quick jaunt in Minneapolis.  After the four of us visited Minnehaha Falls - the largest urban falls in the US - Lori's father and I rode bike trails around two of Minneapolis' lakes.  The trail around the Lake of the Isles was filled with bumpy cracks.  The trail around Lake Calhoun was much nicer.  Even taken together, though, they make a short ride. One interesting note is that the lakes had seperate paths for bicycles and pedestrians.   Spring's rain has been so bad that parts of the pedestrian path were still under water. After a quick visit to the Mall of America for lunch, we drove up here to Duluth.  The hotel is on the canal and the lake is in sight.  Unfortunately, our room has no windows.  It's an interesting room, though.  The building used to be a packaging plant for a hardware distributor.  It was renovated and given rooms, a restaurant, and a pool.  Our room is a studio suite.  It has a high wooden ceiling and a huge pillar in the middle.
We walked around the harbor, eating burgers and watching the horizontal drawbridge.  We also stopped by the Army Corps of Engineers Museum. It had a large display of model boats and mock-ups of cabins and a pilot house.  It had no t-shirts for sale, though. The aquarium did have t-shirts, but it wasn't nearly as nice as Baltimore's. We also did some driving.  I'll bet Duluth rivals San Francisco for hilly streets. 7:48 pm: We saw AI.  Take random pages from these authors: Bradbury, Dick, Vonnegut, Clarke, and Disney.  Put them together in that order and you have AI.  It was nice to see a sci-fi film that wasn't a horror film.  And it was mostly interesting to watch.  Spielberg was doing his best to be Kubrick, but he didn't quite make it.  That's not necessarily a bad thing, you understand.   
 
cool sunny slight headwind hilly dogs: 2  We made two mistakes today.  First, we underestimated the distance.  Partially, this was due to us leaving the trail, but mostly, we just miscalculated.  We hadn't gone much over 30 in a few weeks. We left the path outside of Superior because it was terribly mushy, covered with thicker gravel than we feel stable on.  It also would have slowed us down quite a bit. So we took several county roads that our map said were bike-friendly.  The map was pretty much right; we had little traffic and saw much farmland and hilly woodland that we would have missed on the trail.   The second mistake we made was not bringing food when there was a chance that we'd not see  civilization until the end of the trip.  It has been rare for us to go 30 miles without any sort of food source-restaurant, gas station, or (most often) a bar.  There were no facilities for the entire 40 miles because we went north of any towns. And nowhere to go to the bathroom, either. 
overcast cool a few raindrops half hilly, half downhill 
grumpy clouds, mixed with sun comfortable sidewind rolling, with one big hill  The road portion of the ride today may have been the nicest of the trip.  Except for one hill, the rolling terrain gently brings you high enough to get pretty glimpses of the lake and the woods all around.  The road is in good shape-nice shoulder without the annoying bumpy cracks of yesterday's US2.  
We took the ferry over to Madelin Island to watch the Independence Day parade.  The island's small town of La Pointe would probably be described as quaint by a travel guide.  There seems to be a small hippy contingent--odd artwork and greenie slogans abound. The parade reflected a mix of hippy with old-fashioned small-townness.  It began with the blaring siren of their fire truck, continued with a group of environmentalists protesting a planned fire tower, and ended with a papier-mache freak show.  Interspersed throughout were clowns, business-sponsored floats, classic cars, beauty queens, and a band.  Everyone had candy to throw at the kids. Not that the kids deserved it of course.  The little beasts rushed into the street to grab the stuff, to fight with each other, and to even snatch it right out of my hand!  In some way it's nice to be reminded that rudeness is universal and not just confined to our much-maligned East Coast cities. We arrived early enough to select a good viewing spot, but it soon became evident that we would not be able to see when the crowds started pressing in.  We maintained a small beachhead on the edge of the blacktop, and we sat cross-legged to keep from obstructing the view of those who arrived later.  The children seemed to feel it was their right to stand in front of me.  They battered each other with flags.  They made  annoying noises.  They climbed on, hit, and kicked me.  Parents encouraged this behaviour, they also seemed to object to their kids being pushed in front of floats.  Go figure. One father and his two sons (named after the local towns, La Pointe and Bayfield--truly!) decided to stand in front of me.  He didn't want to block the view for his wife and in-laws.  Eventually, his wife joined him so that she could talk to an elderly woman who figured I wouldn't mind staring at the backs of two more knees. But all-in-all, it was a beautiful island and a nice parade.  The kid gave me back my camera and didn't cry too loudly when I stole his Jolly Rancher.   But you should read this book and ignore these failings because it does a great job at defining its crisis.  The book is about a man finding his faith and then losing it..  The crisis of faith is well-drawn and the author doesn't attempt to answer the question it keeps asking:  how could God do that? The title comes from Matthew (10:29) and a character's observation that although a sparrow does not fall without God's knowledge, the sparrow still falls. Generally, I don't like books this open-ended, but I really liked this one.  I think it is a great jumping-off point for considering: the value of faith, the formation of community, and the approach to interacting with strangers (aliens, of course, and by extension, human cultures).  One warning: the book has a graphic discussion of a rape.
sunny cool breezy flat  Last night's fireworks were good, too.  They fired from the little harbor, and we watched them from our balcony.  There were a few drops of rain, but it was nice to spend the 4th in cool weather for a change.  And the safety of our room was only a few feet away.  The show itself was very good, and there wasn't the crazy crush of people DC gets. We could also see Madelin Island's fireworks across the channel. Tomorrow, we drive 6 hours to Minneapolis and fly home.  I miss everyone at home, but I don't look forward to summer in Maryland. 

bugs bugs bugs bugs bugs bugs bugs bugs DUST bugs bugs bugs bugs bugs bugs bugs It's dry and sunny and not too hot - I suppose we shouldn't complain. Gnats don't really taste like anything. Our guide book said there would be a restaurant at White's Ferry - the Ferry is operating, but it doesn't look like the restaurant has been open for a while. So we had a picnic from our food packs - bananas, peanut butter, crackers. There was a cool gutted three story brick building with the forest growing up into it, we stared into that for a while. At mile 42, the bridge over an inlet is under construction - we had to walk the bikes and lift them over the metal cross braces. Passed by Miss Lettie's place on the river and had a chat with the woman smoking on the porch. The rambler is ideal lawn ornament nesting ground and overlooks the Potomac. Point of Rocks brick tunnel entrance for the train tracks. Also passed a power plant with puffing smoke-stacks. We stopped in Brunswick and learned not to ask people in cars where anything is. We'd read that this was a problem in another biker's account - but until you experience it yourself, it's hard to believe that a person whose lived their whole life in a town can so grossly underestimate distance and hills. We asked a man taking photos of the trains if there was a place to stay in town. He assured us that the only place would not have any available rooms - always booked. Also couldn't seem to think of anywhere for us to eat except King's Pizza. We biked over the tracks and up the steep hill (everything away from the Potomac is up - as always with rivers.) And had some good Italian food. We looked in the phonebook and called George's Mill Farm B&B. Turns out to be quite a lovely place. When she heard we were on bikes, she offered to come get us, which was good because it was over the river in Lovittsville, VA, and fifteen driving minutes through quite hilly country. Saved us an hour and a half of biking. The farm has been in the family for seven generations, and is still operated by the son in law. The daughter and her family live in a renovated barn on the property, and her mother operates the B&B in the gorgeous old farm house. Friendly dogs. Claw-foot tub. Thus ends our first day on the road!
Here's another poem: "Serene, Wooded Trail" Butterfly suicide  In my front spokes  Spinning  Can't stop  Pop rocks  Off my tire  Bomb ducks flap-quacking,  Quite mad  Can't stop  Papa goose hissing  Spread wings  I'll take you on, you metal buffalo Stay away from my babies! Hiss  Can't stop  Turtles plop  Drop in the soup  Awoken from a sunny nap  Who was that masked man?  Can't stop  Gotta get to the other side  If this is the slow lane  Why am I speeding by  Sorry bug, goose and duck  Sorry turtles, too.  I'm busy getting to that quiet spot  Can't stop for you  Can't stop. It's one a.m. and I can't sleep. We're camping at Opequon Junction right between the canal and river. Evverything was fine when we got here. We set up our camp and made a nice campfire. We cooked our dinner and enjoyed the peaceful, cool woods. A local guy came by and chatted for a while. He was out hunting mushrooms. Says it's been too dry this year for them, but he was looking anyway. He bikes the trail, ten miles a day, for his heart. He's fifty and lived in Falling Waters, MD all his life. We got all settled in the tent a little before sun-down, so we could read and relax. I was naked - the butt is really sore and a night out of the bike shorts seems to help. We had the tent flaps wide open towards the river because no one was out there and the breeze and view were lovely. Just at sunset, three hikers arrived that scared the wits out of me. They came in loud and crashing through the woods. They started immediately to set up a roaring camp fire, and talked about our camp, not realizing we were in the tent. They sounded drunk to me, and cursed about the obvious presence of a woman at this site - so much camping gear and such. "Oh, why's a bitch got to be here?"  "Why not? They have to go and do everything these days." I asked John to go out there and greet them so they'd know we were here and know that there was a guy present. John climbed out and talked to them, but he left the tent flap wide open while I was still struggling to pull up my shorts. I'm near heart attack, and feel like John, my only protection, doesn't even seem to realize how threatened I feel. When we talked about it later, he was surprised that I was so scared of them. In his view they were harmless good old boys just blowing off steam with their talk and not really a threat at all. I had visions of Deliverance. Sorry, but I am a city girl and quite prejudiced against poor country folks. Especially when they like to yell and burn things. I climbed out of the tent and helped John clear our junk off of the picnic table. They're very young, and are hiking to Harper's Ferry to do some climbing. They were going to ride bikes, but discovered at the last minute that the bikes were all broken down. One guy brought a hook on a string and is trying to catch a fish, and the others bet that he won't. They complained of having no pot to cook on the fire. I was convinced they were going to club us with branches as soon as we lay down in the tent and steal our bikes and mess kit.  But John seemed quite calm, so we went back to bed and darkness fell.  1. Cannot get comfortable. 2. Dogs begin barking at sundown, incessantly, from miles up and down the river. More people around than I realized. 3. Frogs start up and sound like broken ambulance sirens. 4. One hiker is determined to burn every scrap of loose brush within an hour's hike - he's got a huge bonfire crackling and he stomps all around the camp site - I hear him go by our stuff repeatedly.  5. Bull is bellowing from across river in West Virginia. 6. Strangest sound - I think the owls are mating, seemingly right next to the tent. So now I'm up, sitting at the picnic table keeping an eye on the pyromaniac and scribbling away in my journal. At least tonight we have a reservation at the Econolodge in Hancock, MD. We'll get a regular night's sleep, do some laundry, and check out the bike shop, then head for Cumberland on Thursday.  There are a few more detours off the path ahead of us. Williamsport is ten miles north - maybe we'll find a good restaurant for breakfast and a flushing toilet.
We got up, cooked a snack, packed up all of our gear, and left the camp site by 7:30 a.m.  The hikers seemed to be impatiently waiting for us to leave. We had invited them to share the picnic table with us, and they'd refused, but when we left they jumped onto it and got all comfy. I guess they didn't like us any more than we liked them. We easily biked the ten miles to Williamsport. Right on the trail the park service has restored an antique brick warehouse and uses it as a museum and visitor center. It's quite well done and the fellow there told us where to go for breakfast. Again, away from the river is always UP, but at the top of the hill, we found a smoky little diner and had a GREAT breakfast. We met two bikers from Ontario, Murray and Jerry. They're biking the whole C&O canal - Cumberland to D.C. (the downhill direction) and are camping the whole way. Since they came from where we're headed and we came from where they're headed, we shared info. They told us about a friend of theirs also biking but at a slower pace - told us to keep an eye out for Dave. And they highly recommended the bike shop in Hancock - we hope to find some good advice about how to bike over the Eastern Divide - our bike book strongly advises against it, but it's a few years old and perhaps there's a new, safer route. After Williamsport, we biked fifteen miles more to Big Pool, then took a detour through Fort Frederick, a reconstructed revolutionary war fort. It was such a surprise. The name didn't ring any bells with me, it wasn't until we biked into it that I recognized the site - Dad and I had hiked to this park a few years ago. Mom and Dad were staying in a cabin in West Virginia, and I'd joined them for a few days. Dad and I hiked out with only a rough impression of where we were going. We ended up hiking for hours, illegally crossing a train bridge, and came out at the fort. I called home on the cell phone from there to say, "Guess where we are?" We found the ten mile Rail to Trail path - the reason we left the canal, and biked it. It's paved, arrow-straight, smooth, and shadeless. Got more sunburn. By this time we were really tired and hungry for lunch - the path comes right out at Hancock and we straggled up the hill to the Econolodge.  Our butts are so so sore. The desetin doesn't help, it hurts even worse. We discovered that the wonderful bike shop is open all week EXCEPT Wednesdays! So we decide to take tomorrow off for bike advice, laundry, and butt recovery. We showered, changed, and WALKED back down the hill to Weaver's Restaurant. They actually had filet mignon on the menu, and it was quite good! Also had an old country style salad bar - apple butter, cottage cheese, macaroni salad and pickled eggs. But the absolute HIGHLIGHT at Weaver's is dessert. Wonderful freshly baked pies and sweetrolls towered in a glass case by the counter. We got two slices of caramel apple nut pie to go and hobbled sleepily back to the hotel. I called Mom & Dad to commiserate about the horrible camping experience and ask Dad's advice about the Divide. Turns out that the Ohio maps and flat shoes we were waiting for had arrived, so they decided to come meet us in Hancock, only a few hour's drive for them. We stumbled back down the hill one last tonight and checked email at the library, then collapsed into bed and slept REALLY well.
Went back to Weaver's for lunch - it turns out that when Dad was a boy his family would always come through Hancock on their way to the farm in WV where they vacationed. They'd always stop and stock up on bread and baked goodies at Weaver's! Also, Mom and Dad came here a few years ago, too. So they enjoyed the trip down memory lane and we enjoyed the food again. The homemade bean and ham soup, salad bar, and chicken fingers. All delish! After lunch we went back to the room and looked through our mail. We went through all of our bags to see if we could send anything home with the parents. I almost cried when they left. It seems more serious now - I won't see them again for months. Plus, I'm tired and weepy anyway. We took a long nap then went to George's to get the bikes. We rode over to the library - lots of emails, especially from Richard. Wonder when he'll be joining us! Back at the room we ordered a sub and a stromboli from Fox's Delivery. We made a reservation at the Paw Paw Patch B&B  for tomorrow night - we're going to take the last bit to Cumberland in two parts and hope to be there by Saturday. Still don't know what to do about that divide. We'll just keep asking around.
We biked back to Weaver's for our last meal in Hancock and met Dave, Jerry and Murray's friend from Ontario. Back home, they're all in a bike club together that rides weekly. But Dave couldn't take as much time off as the other fellows, to bike the whole thing, so he was just biking some of the more scenic sections. Since we were both going north, once out on the trail we caught up with him and chatted for a bit. When John and I were ready to pass him, we took photos of each other and said farewell. We also played tag all morning with a foursome - they went faster than us, but kept stopping for things. They were camping near Hancock and only biking out and back from there, not going one way. So they didn't carry their gear, just lunches and fishing poles.  The path is rougher up here. We saw lots more turtles and I ran over a snake. He didn't move at all, so I hope he was already dead. He was different shades of brown which a diamond pattern - wonder if it was an actual Diamondback. We had a picnic lunch at a little camp site on the trail. We passed beaver heaven - every tree for a quarter mile was chewed down or at least gnawed on. The bit of canal at that point had beaver dams every several yards. Didn't see any of the critters, though. Then we came to the Paw Paw Tunnel.  The path gets very rocky and narrow as it cuts up into the mountain. On the left, the rock rises straight up from the path to higher and higher heights. On the other, it drops away immediately into the canal, actually flowing here. The path goes right into the tunnel, hugging one wall. A railing separates us from the drop into the canal. We walked our bikes through in the darkness - I think I drove John crazy quoting Bible verses - "Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will not fear, thou art with me "  It's 3,000 feet long. But then we were out of it and not far from the B&B. We went to bike up the hill from the towpath - and we encountered our FIRST CALAMITY! John's chain snapped. We sat be the side of the road and struggled to repair it - we have chain tools, but no extra pins, just an extra bit of chain. It's really hard if you don't have the little pins with the extra bit to hold it in place - using used pins is almost impossible. Cars with empty bike racks sped past us waving. I could have thrown my alien tool at them. Two girls in a tiny hatchback with no room for bikes or us asked if we needed any help. Ironic. John got it fixed and we're happy to say that the marriage survived snappishness under pressure. Not naming names. I plead the fifth. We got into town and to the post office, halfway up the hill to the B&B (of course it's at the top of the hill) when it snapped again. So John walked his bike the rest of the way up the hill - almost a mile.  And here we've collapsed, at the home of Kay & Bill. We got cleaned up and made a bunch of phone calls to bike shops and shuttle services. Left messages and then walked back down the hill to the only restaurant in town - the Riverside. The turkey sandwich and fries with gravy were good comfort food - no dessert, though. They only had coconut cream pie and ice cream. We walked back up the hill - our phones don't work here. There're no bike shops in town. No one sells spare parts. We asked around town (at the restaurant and gas station) if there was anyone in town who might be willing to give us a ride to Cumberland, thirty miles away and the closest bike shop. Everyone at the gas station thought of Josh at the same time - says he does odd construction contracts from time to time, but is mostly the jack of all trades in town - little bit of this, little bit of that. And - a requirement for residency - he has a truck. So the folks tell us he comes in the gas station every day for lottery, so he should be by sometime - we tell them we're at the Paw Paw Patch B&B. Turns out Josh is Bill's grandson! So while limping back up to the B&B, we discussed the strange experience of truly being in need and at the mercy of strangers. Before we could ask Bill about how to contact Josh, he offered to drive us himself (in his truck). So tomorrow, we'll impose upon his gardening time and ride into Cumberland for a new chain.  We talked about a few things today - first, we agreed that we're only doing this because we want to. We are not answerable to anyone about whether or not we bike the whole way. So if we get a ride or decide to take the train or buy an RV, it's our choice and we should be enjoying ourselves. Second, I realized that having Seattle as our goal was freaking me out. I felt doomed to failure - watching our average speed (too slow to get to Seattle), miles covered per day (not far enough to get to Seattle), and seeing snags like the chain and the day off for exhaustion (more obstacles in the path of reaching Seattle). So we decided to set this goal instead: 10 weeks or $15,000 - whichever ran out first. That way, it takes the worry out of the day to day. We'll just see how far we do make it with the time and money we have. I feel much freer to enjoy the journey when I'm not seeing an impossible goal ahead.  Oh, and I decided to shave my legs - I've been abstaining for a couple months - trying to be more natural and not need shaving cream and razors and such - but I don't care. I wasn't getting used to the Euro look and I just didn't feel clean! Leg hair collects mud and bugs, yuck. So you can't take the girl out of the biker, I suppose. We chatted with Bill and Kay for a while before heading for bed. Kay wants to retire - she's tired of the B&B and the work is too much for her. Bill wants to keep going for another year at least - he's helping with the housekeeping now and thinks their 16 year old granddaughter could work for them over the Summer and help them get through the busy tourist season. Bill's been cleaning the guest bathroom, and he got the bright idea that the tub would stay shiny and clean with a little turtle wax! Seems to work fine - the bath was quite refreshing.  I keep getting bitten by bugs, despite copious repellant. Maybe I should try a different brand. If we could find a mall, I would like a Victoria's Secret for some comfy boxers to replace hurty ellastic underwear, an Eddie Bauer for some larger khaki pants, a new stationary box that's waterproof and sturdier than my cardboard one (it's gotten wet and ripped up), some dove soap  Sigh. Dreaming of stuff less than a week on the road. Good night!
As we loaded up the bikes and chatted with some fellow riders (with interesting bike seats that were in two pieces, separately adjustable for perfect bun support), one of them noticed that John's rear tire was flat as a pancake. So while he unloaded his gear, tried to patch the inner tube, failed at that, replaced the inner tube, patched the tire, put it back together, pumped it up and reloaded his gear, John the train guy told me his whole life story. He's only 23, dreamed of being a trucker but can't get his license because he's diabetic, He loves trains and runs a mail-order company for serious collectors for high-quality model trains and sets. He hopes to get it online soon, and to open a hobby shop. Anyway, in between John's storytelling, I made some calls to "bike-shops" listed in our trail guide, to find out when we could replace John's tire. But the first place I called, listed in Rockwood, said "we don't have no bikes." "Well, you're listed in the trail guide as a bike repair shop." "I ain't listed in no trail guide." Stunned to silence momentarily by this logic - "Okay, well, uh  where would the closest place be where we might get our bike fixed?" "Somerset's the only place near here." Forty miles due west of the trail, of course. The calls went downhill from there. Seems most of the places listed as bike shops are really river rafting shops. Have no idea how they made this list. Guess we'll see how long a dollar bill can hold out. After an hour, we were finally ready to bike. The beginning of the trail and whenever the trail crosses a driveway or road, the gravel is large, loose and mushy. I'm very scared of biking in that stuff. But mostly the trail is wider and smoother than the C&O towpath was - it's crushed limestone rolled flat. Right as we started, a blue bird of happiness crossed our path. A good omen for getting underway! I'm so grateful for Bill & Kay's generosity. I feel more optimistic about actually getting somewhere on the trip now.  We stopped for lunch at the Citgo in Garret, PA - they made good subs. The young girl working there was excited to meet us because she and her boyfriend were planning a trip to D.C. tomorrow. We gave her tourism advice then got back on the trail for a few more miles. We finished the day in Rockwood, PA at the Rockwood Trail House, a B&B that borders the trail. They run a snack bar on the back porch, bike rentals out of the shed, and he's planning on building a bike repair shop. Great little place for those on the road! John's tire seems to be holding out, but we do need a new tire since this one's got a hole patched with a fraying dollar bill. Right now we're hiding in our room, all clean and showered, washing laundry (I really like doing laundry, you may have noticed), and enjoying the ceiling fan on our naked butts. No new bug bites or bruises to report. We hope to get to Ohiopyle State Park tomorrow, thirty miles up the trail. Also hope there's a bike shop there. We should be in Ohio in four or five days. We had dinner at the Tail House's snack bar - they made great burgers from the owner's own beef - they're in the dairy business, but are getting out (which means Bossy becomes lunch).  The local elder generation gathers here on the porch in the evenings for ice cream and gossip. I enjoyed eavesdropping on the news of the town. We played scrabble - I trounced John! I always play better when exhausted. We met Steve and David - they're from Columbus, OH, and drove over to the PA trail to ride part of in over several days. They're going down and back, so we'll probably cross paths again. They're on road bikes! They warned us that the detour from Fort Hill to Confluence is a killer hill, up 400 feet in less than a mile. Sounds like they plan on trying out the unfinished trail on they're way back - the railroad ties have been removed, but the surface is large loose gravel. Not sure which I prefer - road rash from wiping out in a pile of large rocks, or heart failure from pedaling uphill. I've noticed the trail changing - MD & PA are quite different in a lot of ways.  Maryland's trail is much more closely wooded with deciduous trees and tangled undergrowth. The Potomac River is wide and flows lazily. The trail is deeply shaded and winds about - pierced by patches of living rock and root. There are many bugs and birds under the trees, too. As we got into Western MD, I noticed a shift to more evergreen - the forest took on that twilit cast, pine needles blanketed everything, and scented the air like Christmas. In PA, the land tilts in terraced angles up from the Youghiogheny River - the trail is partway up the ridge and open to a much wider view across the river valley. The forest here is light Aspen woods, clear floor, and broken often by pasture and crops. The Yough winds tightly and flows narrow and swift - we get great water sounds up here on the trail. And the trail itself is wider and smoothed over - more tame and easier to ride. The trees are set further back from the trail, so less shade, fewer bugs and birds. Also, they're noticeably behind MD's trees seasonally - MD is lush and well on towards Summer, PA is still only about half budded, looking like early Spring. Frank Lloyd Wright built Falling Waters here in southwestern PA - the land  bordering the trail reminds me of that place. Water trickles and cascades over layered rock topped by monstrous rhododendrons. When the hillside peeks through, sometimes it's limestone flecked with mica, sometimes red clay turning the runoff into chocolate soup.
Let's see - we started the day in Rockwood - Debbie came to cook us breakfast before going to church to play piano. It was delicious - freshly smoked sausage from a local farmer, pancakes and eggs. Lynn and Debbie are the owners - they're the ones getting out the dairy business and getting into the B&B business. It took them two and a half years to fix this place up. The town was abuzz with rumors as to what the couple was planning. For example, Doug owns a convenience store and deli down the road. He's known Debbie all her life - she used to baby-sit his children. But he decided that Lynn and Debbie were going into the restaurant business or something that would put him under. He began driving the one block down the road and turning around slowly in the parking lot across the street - trying to peak in at them during renovations. He never asked to see the place or asked what they were up to, just kept spying. She said the name of his shop, and I was stunned - that's who we called yesterday about a bike shop! I told Debbie about the trail guide listing him, and my baffling conversation. Debbie was dumbfounded that Doug had told us to go to Somerset, because everyone in town knows that Lynn stocks a wide variety of bike parts in his basement and can fix or replace just about anything! Seems like Doug is still holding some sort of grudge against the Trail House. Anyway, Debbie called Lynn at the farm and told him to come over when he was done milking, and get John a new tire. Debbie told me all about their four daughters and another business she's planning to start - an hour away in a larger town - a fitness center for women called Curves. It's a chain, and three of her daughters already have franchises in different towns - one is in Easton, MD!  I got to meet one of their daughters and their grandson, and Lynn's parents run the snack shop in the back, so we'd met them last night. They were going to close the shop, because it was too much to do with the farm and the fitness center - but his parents got upset and said they couldn't close it - they enjoyed the local gathering place too much. So Lynn and Debbie told them - well, if you run it, you can keep it open. So they did. Debbie finally had to go - we packed up, and Lynn arrived and gave John a new tire. Turns out that the bikes he rents to people on the trail are the exact same Trek model as John's. So off we went, aiming for 20 miles before lunch - we want to get to Confluence, PA because we'd heard a trail rumor that there's a nice restaurant on the river there. For twelve miles, the trail was beautiful, then we arrived at Fort Hill, the beginning of the detour that Steve and David mentioned. A big sign warned us to get off the trail and take to the roads. We peaked around it at the gravel - tire-shredding rocky gravel. I said, "Nope." So off the trail we went. The hill curved up a hill to the right, disappearing around the first bend. We biked around it and hit a practically vertical wall of asphalt. I said, "Nope" again and walked my bike all the way - almost a mile. My chest was exploding, my head spun - horrid! Then we got on a busy road and biked steeply downhill for six miles - yahoo! It was a bit scary, going so fast. There's no way we could have stopped our bikes. We  sailed into Confluence - a cute little town with touristy businesses right along the Yough and the beginning of the South Yough Trail. It's quite lovely. We found the restaurant - a fancy, whimsical place that is also a B&B! I had a fried fish sandwich - quite tasty. As we were eating, David arrived and was seated at the table next to ours. I guess they wanted to keep the stinky bikers together. He was conspicuously alone. "Where's Steve?"  David told us the whole story - they made it down to Myersdale after seeing us in Rockwood, but not until after dark. Mrs. Yoder, the proprietor of the dingy motel in which they'd made reservations, was not happy with them! (She said that - " Mrs. Yoder is not happy!") Sounds like Myersdale is just full of fun characters. Today, Steve and David headed back up the trail, and got the Fort Hill just fine. David decided to try the trail out - he said Steve was behind him when he started, but must have chickened out and gone back to take the road. As  we ate and chatted, it was longer and longer without any sign of Steve. "Don't you think you should go back?" "Naw - he's coming." We got the distinct impression that David was enjoying very much showing up the younger man. After forty-five minutes, Steve showed up, walking his bike, flat tire, grumbling and snapping. He'd ripped the sidewall out of his tire on that evil gravel, and tried to patch it unsuccessfully, so he'd walked the whole way. Not a happy camper! He dropped it off at a bike shop and sat down to some lunch, not speaking much to David. Don't blame him. He'd never done trail-riding before, and David had sworn that his road bike would be fine. Well, we hit the trail again and as the afternoon progressed, I felt more and more woozy. Also, the trail began to fill up as we entered Ohiopyle State Park. It's Sunday afternoon - and the park is beautiful today - it's weird to see so many people. And they're not as friendly as the long-term bikers we meet during the week - they don't seem to know simple etiquette about passing and staying in single file and such. And no one says hello. Maybe it's a Pittsburgh thing. But I felt quite wretched by the time we got into the town of Ohiopyle. I sat on the ground next to the trail while John biked around and found us a room. David and Steve arrived and stopped for a sugar break. They still have 36 more miles to get back to their cars. I get the distinct impression that Steve won't be making any more bike trips with David.  So John came back and got me - I crashed in the room all afternoon. We went and had dinner at a filthy convenience store that brags "Campbell's canned soups," which they were out of at the moment, and were instead serving what tasted like Lipton soup packets. Oh well. I took lots of medicine and am going to bed, now. I hope this doesn't mean I'm really sick - I really feel awful right now. So ends our first week of biking. Good night!

We aimed to get to Smithton before lunch, another 18 miles in 2 hours. We did fine except for total lack of bathrooms! I used the woods, but I hate that. We met a trail manager in Smithton and registered our vote for portapotties. He says they're planning to break up the long stretch with a permanent toilet - they don't like portas because then the service truck has to drive on the trail. We biked uphill into town and went to Charla's place - I had lots of fried food, and John got Pierogy Pizza! Now it was decision time. There were hotels in Smithton, we could have stopped for the night, we'd already don 36 miles. But it's only lunch time and McKeesport, the end of the North Yough Trail just south of Pittsburgh is only 25 miles away. We had visions of a large hotel chain with data ports and whirlpools. So off we went, taking 5 mile butt breaks. The going here was so easy - the trail is smooth, the grade slightly downhill, and we have a tailwind. This is the life! We made it 20 miles to Boston, PA, an old little town  with lots of square, brick houses. A baseball game was going on at the park. A couple of B&B's are listed here in Boston, and we both feel shaky. But it's only five more miles to the final goal! The map shows the last three miles of trail into McKeesport as unfinished, but John had read an article in the paper about McKeesport's mayor fighting to finish the trail and biking down to Boston to show it off. So on we went. Today would be a day of hard lessons. A few hundred yards out of Boston, the trail just ended. A non-bike trail went off to the left into Dead Man's Hollow. The path in front of us turned into a train yard littered with tire-ripping garbage. Stuff was stacked on pallets, and train tracks ran alongside us. No Trespassing signs were posted. We don't know what the mayor biked on, but it could not have been this. Lesson number one. When in doubt, go back to what you know.   A teenager came biking towards us through the train-yard on a stunt bike. We asked him how to get into McKeesport. He was unsure, which should have been a red flag, but then told us to go through the train-yard a bit, up this hill to the road, and over the bridge to the right which would take us into town. Sounds simple. I asked how steep the hill was. He said, "I did it without any gears." I said, "Yes, but we're old people." Lesson number two. Never ask a teenager for directions.   We headed into the train-yard. You'll notice by now we are making really stupid mistakes. We found his hill and walked our bikes up a rutted, dirt path into trashy woods. We carefully passed a spot where the path had washed down the steep slope. A huge pile of garbage dumped along the trail from the road above. Finally, we came to "the road." We could see it above us, straight up a steep hill about 200 feet that was once paved with asphalt. Broken asphalt has to be the absolute worst surface on the planet. There was no way possible to a human to bike up that (unless you're a teenager.) So we walked. We struggled, shoving our bikes in front of us, bursting our lungs. I just had visions of getting to the top and gliding down over the river into a lovely city with hotels lining the road. We crested the hill and found - nothing. Lesson number three. Never go up a hill unless you know you need to. All we could see was a road going off in two directions, neither of which giving us any clue as to which way the bridge might lie, and little suburban houses lining the streets in both directions. The lawns are tidy and colorful - the houses little brick ramblers. I decide it was a horrible mistake to ask a teenager for directions, so I go in search of an adult. I find Mary and Irene. They're neighbors, and they're at Irene's house having a nice chat and a few drinks. I didn't spot the half-empty plastic jug of whiskey until later. They were extremely friendly, and  determined to be helpful. I almost screamed when Irene's first instruction was to go back down that hill to the train-yard. But instead of listening to her, I was so desperate and angry by that point that I refused - there had to be another way. . They thought for a while, then off they went in a talking race, arguing, changing their minds, talking at the same time. Mary's dentures were loose. Still, I got a general idea of which way they wanted us to go, and asked if they had a phone book. I wanted to make a reservation at the big lovely hotel we're going to stay in. They brought it out and chatted, telling us about grandkids and time spent in D.C. during WWII. They're both so sweet, but I am so tired.  The phonebook has no listings for big lovely hotels. The phone book has next to nothing in it - a few scary sounding places - Harry's Roadside Motel - and the Angel Inn. The ladies had never heard of the place, but it sounded better than the alternatives, so we called. John made a reservation - a room costs $47. This nightmare is becoming more and more horrific. But the farther we get, the less we want to give even an inch of this hard-earned ground. After looking at family pictures, checking out the pool out back (and spotting the jug), we headed down the road.  Lesson number four. When people give you directions, listen to them. We biked nervously through turn after turn, came down a breakneck hill through town on a busy road with no shoulders. I was so tired, and didn't expect to have to do any of this. The map showed the trail just going straight into town, with accommodation right alongside. John read that the trail was completed all the way through. This was all wrong. We still couldn't see any bridge. I biked up a steep hill and crunched, barely able to get my shoes unclipped off of the pedals. I stand there, legs shaking, unable to lift them, let alone get back on my bike. Then John tells me that I went the wrong way and we need to go back down. That's when I lost it - I started crying. I couldn't go on, but had to, and couldn't believe all of this was happening. I wanted to go home right then - we can't even make it to Pittsburgh, what do we think we're doing?! John just stood there, not knowing what to do about me - he's exhausted, too, but I don't care, this is all his fault. He must have misread the article. He thought of this whole trip in the first place.  So fueled by steely, self-righteous indignation, I got back on my bike and turned around. We came out in front of the bridge and saw with bitter irony that the train-yard came right to the road on our right. If we'd never gone up the hill in the first place, we'd have been to the bridge in five minutes. If we'd listened to Mary and Irene, we would have missed the crunch-hill. I'm already seeing how one day far far in the future, this will probably be hilarious. We biked over the hill and promptly got lost trying to get to the Angel Inn. I'm no longer speaking to John, I'm walking my bike, and refuse to move until he asks for directions. He does, and heads out - I walk behind him in grim silence, hoping I pass out just to spite him. Lesson number five. Never go into the unknown when exhausted. Stop before you're too tired to continue. Lesson number six. Don't say any of the things you think in your head when you're exhausted. If I had opened my mouth, we would have been arrested for domestic violence. He may not like the silent treatment, but it is because I love him that I clench my teeth. The Angel Inn is an old convent that has been converted into a hostel - shared bathrooms, dorm-style lodging. McKeesport is a horribly dilapidated suburb of Pittsburgh - when steel left and the malls were built in other towns, this place curled up and died. All it has now is a huge aging population who can't leave and a depressing low-income population. The rooms weren't made up, yet, so while the owner bustled about, we carried our bikes up, unloaded our stuff, carried the bags up another flight of stairs, showered and changed. Then we sat in the living room, unable to move. She took pity on our exhausted selves and drove us around the corner to the Eat-n-Park, a Denny's style diner. The food really hit the spot, and I had regained enough fortitude to treat John with civility. We hobbled back to the inn and discovered a wretched, eye-watering odor in our room. I could not imagine walking through the door, let alone sleeping in there. Then John sat on the bed and it collapsed onto the floor. So we moved our stuff across the hall and tried to find some sheets that would fit the bed. Couldn't find any. So we called the owner at home. She was on her way back over anyway, so she said she'd make up the other room for us. We watched junkyard wars down in the living room while we waited, then finally we fell into the little bed in the little room, the end of this too long, too far day.
We went to the Eat-n-Park for breakfast - what an adventure! The breakfast buffet was great. It had such oddities as potato cakes, mashed and deep fried sweet potato nuggets, breaded and fried banana nuggets. What fun! We got our first roll of film developed at the Rite Aid and enjoyed looking over the first week of our trip. Also, we bought a detailed atlas map of Pittsburgh and rented a big honking truck! I love the truck. We could just drive past Pittsburgh, return the truck on the other side and bike from there. Or we'll at least drive our route and find the best way through before setting out on the bikes again. I'm a little nervous about the unknown for some reason, can't imagine why (see yesterday). Anyway, we went to the mall and I soaked in the chain stores like a hot tub - Victoria's Secret, Eddie Bauer, Disney Store! Heaven! Boy, exhaustion makes you shallow. We had lunch at the food court and found me some boxer shorts and John a new book to read. Then we took a long drive through icky traffic to a bike shop. It's a great place, though - nice people. We got more bike shorts, a new pair of gloves for me (I left mine on Mary and Irene's glider yesterday), bike pump, inner tube, cliff bars  We are at least supporting the independent bike shop industry with this trip. The bike dude there suggested riding through the city along the river, rather than trying to piece together the disjointed bits of trail that goes around the city. It'd be shorter, anyway.    By the time we got back to The Angel Inn, I was really hungry. We found an Indian restaurant in the phone book and drove through town. It was pretty good! After dinner, it was too late to go driving through town looking for our bike-route, so we'll have to do that tomorrow morning before returning the truck and biking into Pittsburgh.
Then we came to a hill. It was purely evil - steep, curved, shoulderless, busy - no way. So we back tracked and tried to find a way around it. But the deal is - this thing is a high bluff that starts as a cliff right on the river, and extends inland for a long way. The houses and roads are strung along the sides of this thing like Christmas tree ornaments. I freaked out - I felt like we didn't have any options - we'd have to give up on getting past Pittsburgh, and if we were always going to be hitting impossible spots, why were we even trying to bike across country in the first place? It was almost noon, late for checking out of the hotel, late for returning the truck, and we were hungry.  So John decided to go ahead and reserve another day at the Angel Inn, another day on the truck, and find someplace to eat. After lunch, and feeling a little less apocalyptic, we looked at the map carefully and tried another route. We found a way that extends a few miles inland, climbs the bluff at a shallower incline, and crosses over at a low point. It'll still be a long uphill, but at least I'm sure we can bike it. Once we found our way back to the river, we continued Northwest on 51, thinking we could just stay on it all the way into Ohio. But it was shut down to two lanes, with no shoulder, construction for miles and miles. So we went back and checked out northern end of the Montour Trail, a bit that's finished for 11 miles from route 51 west to the Pittsburgh International Airport. It looks like a beautiful trail, and there are nice hotels at the airport. The bit of trail crosses route 30, and we drove that all the way into Ohio - it's long roller-coaster hills all the way, but it's a nice country road with a wide shoulder. Should be fun. So we headed back to McKeesport for ONE MORE NIGHT, confident that tomorrow we can bike out of here and eventually get to Ohio.  We went to the movies and saw The Mummy Returns - very silly. We had a yuppy dinner at the Cap City Diner, and mailed a large package of stuff home.  I suppose I should explain why we didn't mail ourselves home after the eighth day - the horrible day. In the morning, after some good sleep, the hideous nightmare was in new perspective. We talked about it (once I could speak without screaming) and agreed that we had learned some valuable lessons. If we quit now, we'd waste what we had learned - if we continued, we knew better now what we could do, and what our limitations are. Besides, the first 60 miles of that day were great! So we've taken a day to recuperate from overdoing it, and a day to trail-blaze. We'll be back on the road tomorrow, and once we hit the Ohio bike-maps and then the Adventure Cycling maps, it should be much easier. So it's the end of another day, and we are READY to get moving!
So we started this morning with one last breakfast at the Eat-n-Park, then loaded up our bikes and threw it all in the truck. We drove to the Enterprise office and they drove us to the beginning of the trail - we wanted to see if the trail got us over the river into town before disappearing. It didn't go anywhere, so we got onto the roads and headed north. At first I was panicky about the traffic - so many cars, so fast  watching how close they would come to John - I had horrible visions of him getting run over by a big truck. Or a volkswagon. Or that SUV. Or  they really drive like maniacs up here. John kept biking up onto the sidewalk for particularly narrow stretches. Twice, we had 18-wheelers stuck behind us, unable to pass for short bits. They seemed patient with us, though, and we were careful to get out of their way as soon as we could. We stopped at Kennywood Park and talked to the elderly gate-keeper. The amusement park opened in 1895 as a recreational stop on the streetcar line, to draw more customers to use the public transportation. It's been run continuously as an amusement park since then. They still have the original carousel, but now they have roller-coasters to attract a younger crowd. The man was funny - he said he was going to call an ambulance to follow us, sure I was about to pass out and collapse into the road. I suppose I was a bit red-faced and breathless. But we had a nice rest break listening to his stories. He also told us about a time he picked up a girl hitchhiking - she was from Germany and he picked her up to tell her how dangerous it is to hitchhike in this country. He called his wife and they made up a bed for her. He lectured her about how things were different here and she couldn't rely on the kindness of strangers. Then there was the time a guy was biking south from Canada or something, and had no money and no where to stay. He wanted to know if he could set up a tent, and the guy took him home, too, with a lecture and a shake of the head. Seems to me that with enough kind strangers like this fellow, the U.S. isn't such a scary place, after all.  We took another break from the crazy streets at the Waterfront - a newly developed area that used to be part of the continuous chain of steel mills up and down the river banks. They've left a few of the old brick structures for visual interest, and paved and landscaped the rest, bringing in restaurants and a movie theater, etc. The roads are very wide here and mostly empty, since quite a few of the places haven't opened, yet. It'll probably be quite a crowded hot spot when it's all finished. We biked on and had lunch in a historic old neighborhood that's beginning to see some gentrification - we ate at Cuska's caf - a burger and beer joint with a very rude waitress. By sneaking through some parking lots and over an abandoned, littered lot under a bridge, we managed to avoid an intersection under construction.  Our last bit of biking today brought us to another area of new development - Station's Square - a little like Harbor Place in Baltimore. We got a taxi to take us to the Relax & Wash laundromat. The driver is a grad-student - she was fun to talk to. She gave us postcards of the city. We washed all our stuff and watched (appropriately) soaps. We had dinner at Houlihans, and are back in our room for the evening. We plan on biking to the airport tomorrow, and then we can celebrate getting through Pittsburgh!
John likes to jump on and off sidewalks, ride through or walk through cross walks, etc. That makes me really nervous. I don't like going on and off the street and up and down the handicap access dips on the sidewalks - weaving around, climbing on and off the bike. I figure once you get on the street and establish your presence on the road, you should be consistent - not swerve unpredictably. We make the cars nervous enough as it is. So I told John I was just going to stay on the road because all the weaving was wearing me out and making me nervous. Still - I followed him onto the sidewalk at this one crazy intersection where we had to stop and wait for a light to change on a steep incline. When I tried to get off my bike I tipped over - it's just so heavy with all the gear that once it gets going I can't hold it up. I threw a hissy fit and kicked my bike a couple of times. I also told John that I wanted to weigh our bikes because I think the weight distribution isn't fair - mine's heavier. Waaaah! I know how to have a tantrum. We continued on up and John made it all the way to the top - I had to walk a bit. Total crunch. I just hit a wall on long, sustained exertions. So we rested and snacked at a gas station near the top. Then we got to go, "Wheeeeeee!" for a few miles and the roads were much emptier in this neighborhood and better shoulder. Nice ride! We got back on 51 along the river and had one ugly underpass with construction, then we were on the Montour Trail heading west towards the Airport. The trail had a slight incline, so it was hard pedaling right before lunch, but so much nicer than the roads. A large group of volunteers was working on one spot - landscaping it with flowers along the sides, and painting a large mural under a bridge. We thanked them. We stopped at a bike shop on the path to replace John's bike computer that kept blinking on and off. We got one put on my bike as well.  We biked on to the airport and after a harrowing detour off the trail to the Marriott - they actually have signs on all the roads around there "NO PEDESTRIANS" - it's all exit ramps, no traffic lights or crosswalks. Crazy! We got room service for lunch and I sat in the lovely hot tub. We got internet cable on the TV and surfed for info on Ohio. We had dinner in the hotel's restaurant - steak and salmon - and enjoyed the parade of prom kids all dressed up - there were two high school proms in the hotel. They look so nervous! Ready to walk into a wall, because they're thinking about their shoes, their hair, their makeup   We, the old, unglamorous people shuffled comfortably back to our room and called it an early night. We survived the ride through Pittsburgh!
We got the hotel shuttle guy to drive us to the post office. It's only a mile away, but it's atop this monstrous hill, and across those evil roads with no crosswalks. We mailed more stuff home, and got a fabric marker to write on my biker shirt where we've been. It has a map of the states though which we plan on biking. I wanted to trace our route on it. I bought some more Luna bars and we had lunch at Subway. We picked up a menu for a Chinese delivery place and began the long walk down the hill. Problem: unless you remembered to bring your bungee chord for jumping off the top of the hill, the road winds and switchbacks a long way out of the way to get down. It was probably five miles. We saw a Marriott Suites along our route - so we stopped there to see if their shuttle would take us back - he was much nicer than the guy at our hotel. We had a pleasant surprise when we returned to the room. Stacey at the front desk had sent us a fruit and cheese tray with a note of good wishes. That almost made up for when we sat down to tune up our bikes we discovered a broken spoke on John's bike. We'd brought spoke-wire, this stuff that John at the bike shop back home swore by. But John discovered that it needed to be sawed off at the right length, and surprisingly, the hotel room did not have a saw. So I strapped his wheel onto the back of my bike and headed three miles back up the Montour trail to Trailblazers, the bike shop that we stopped at yesterday. He fixed it all up and I bought some extra spokes. So I at least got to bike six miles today, but I suppose it doesn't count since we didn't get anywhere. I visited the hot tub again, and we ordered Chinese food and vegged out. Rain or shine, tomorrow we are back on the road!
We got to Route 30 and got off the trail. Don't know when we'll ever be on trails again - looks like road biking here on out. 30 has long rolling hills, most of the time the downhill is enough to get you up the uphill, but sometimes not, and then we pedal until we crunch, and then we walk. I walked a lot. You know how they say, "What does up must come down?" Well, anyone who's biked knows it should be - "What goes down must bike back up." And "It's all uphill from here" doesn't sound nearly as positive. "When you hit bottom, there's nowhere to go but up." I think I'd prefer just staying put in the bottom, thank you. I suppose the glass-half-full attitude would be that once you get to the top, going back down is lots of fun. We stopped for lunch at a smokey little diner - good food, but a family or chimneys (with children!) chain-smoked us out of the place. We ate our dessert out on a bench. We stopped for a sugar break near Raccoon Creek and had a nice chat with a fellow at the Traverse Inn. He seemed concerned with our safety, with all of the truckers on 30. We assured him that we were careful. I suppose there's not much we can do if one wants to run us down, though. The mini-golf on the other side of the creek was closed.  We crossed for a few miles through the northernmost tip of West Virginia's panhandle - and down a long, 7% grade. At the bottom of the hill we crossed the Ohio River on a golden steel bridge, and entered Ohio. What a triumph! We're out of Pennsylvania - hooray! John had gotten directions off of the internet to the Motor Lodge. We biked through East Liverpool, formerly known for it's pottery industry, and up a 10% grade for almost a mile. It is a famously evil hill on the historic Lincoln Highway. I thought we were on the wrong side of route 30, so I made John call the motel. Mental note: check directions BEFORE going up hill (didn't we already learn this lesson once?) The woman at the Motor Lodge cheerfully told us that they'd had lots of people complain of this - the directions on line are WRONG. We had to bike back down the hill. Argh! Then we had a near death experience at a horribly confusing intersection - three roads and two exits from a gas station all intersected with one traffic light. Cars were coming out of the gas station willy nilly. Yikes! A few more miles over rolling hills brought us to the Motor Lodge. It used to be a Best Western. The room is large - we threw all of our clothes in the coin-op washer and hung around in our rain gear. The hot tub is closed while they're repainting the pool. Bummer. We went to the steak house in our rain gear for dinner because the dryer was taking forever. No one seemed to mind. We each called our moms to wish them Happy Mother's Day - I talked to mine for a long time. Thus ends our second week on the road!

So we biked back to the Walmart and looked for a map. They sell every imaginable road atlas EXCEPT one for this county. We asked the friendly greeter if anyone in the store was familiar with the area. Between two check-out ladies and some customers, we got excellent directions to Lisbon, on FLAT back roads. Lisbon is a wonderful little town, with quaint, restored Victorian homes, tree-lined avenues, the Lepper Library in a lovely old building with stained glass windows, and a steel trolley diner. We did some emailing in the library and had lunch at the diner - great comfort food.  Heading north from Lisbon, we missed the turn onto the Cardinal Trail - the first leg of the road route that our maps use to take us across the state. So we had to backtrack. The hills are so exhausting. We hit a really bad one, and when we stopped to rest, I got bitten by a bionic mosquito - it really hurt! But we finally got on the maps, and although I have to say their definition of "rolling hills" frightens me - we got to North Georgetown where we planned to camp. Someone at the restaurant in town told us about Camp Timashamie. Turns out the office is closed on Mondays, but the owner came over and welcomed us. He showed us where we could set up our tent, where we could store our bikes, etc. Very hospitable. It's a lovely place with a lake and woods, and lots of kitties. The bath house is well lit, with hot and cold running water. And the restaurant will be open for breakfast. Yay! We had a pleasant evening at our campsite, cooking dinner on our little stove. I took a melatonin pill and slept well, but had very strange dreams and woke up on and off. I dreamt that a guy named Alejandro came and bashed in our tent. He and another Latino guy were in one of the RV's next to the lake. . Seems I worry about tent bashing a lot, and that I'm even more of a racist than I thought - now I'm prejudiced against poor white folks and Latino campers. Then I dreamt that a feral cat got in our tent and was standing on my butt - I couldn't get it to jump off. But despite the odd and menacing dreams, it was a great night of camping - I could get used to this!
Hills hills hills. I thought the midwest was supposed to be flat. I can't believe these hills. We got just east of North Canton, and I had to go to the bathroom very badly. We stopped at a hair dressers. The ladies there have us directions to a road called Sunset Strip. Very funny. That's where all the hotels and restaurants are. We still got a little lost - things are just always farther away than people realize. We checked into a Microtel - they have a hot tub! We went to Cracker Barrel for dinner - the catfish was pretty good.  Oh I forgot about another good thing today - we found a little tree frog in our tent this morning - very cute. He's brown and gray with little yellow arm and leg-pits and tiny suction cup toes. He's perfectly camouflaged for sitting on bark and picnic tables. I was a regular crocodile hunter - "Crikey! What a bute!" I held him while John took photos of our little safari. So good night, and hope the rain stops.
"Pure West" Biking west Finally, pure west But it's raining and  There's no wind To move these clouds. I scan the horizon in front of us Just hoping for an edge of blue An end to all this But it's snapped down Like a Tupperware lid over Ohio. No miles I can bike in a day  Will take me out of the bowl. So I'm just biking  Biking in rain as fast as I can, Pure west.
He finally agreed to go around 11 a.m. As we went, visibility increased the farther we got from Wooster. Seems the fog was pretty local. But the hills are still so big here. Three days into Ohio, and it's still so steeply rolling. Where're all the flat cornfields?! We came to a little bake shop in New Pittsburgh and were hungry for lunch, so we bought some fresh rolls and pumpkin cake and had a picnic on the back steps of the place.  Back on the road - hills hills hills. It's too bad that we couldn't have waited until Jeromesville for lunch, because we met the nicest people at the J-ville Pub and Grill. We went in for drinks and a potty break and ended up staying to chat for a while. They asked all about our journey and they got so excited. They wanted to feed us and give us a ride - they gave us tee-shirts and sweat-shirts and made us promise to call them if it started raining on us - they planned on picking us up and giving us a ride to Mansfield! We posed for photos, and got back on the road, reluctant to leave such generous hospitality.  I was just thinking what a nice day this had turned out to be - no rain, nice lunch, friendly people - when I was nearly mauled by a pack of vicious farm dogs. They came off a porch snarling, snapping, and barking just as I got to the top of a hill - I was exhausted and had little strength to pedal, but I pedaled anyway and screamed like a maniac and bared my teeth - I don't think I've ever been so ferocious. The lead dog snapped two inches from my ankle - but whenever I screamed he veered away. Finally, I picked up enough speed and got far enough from their house that they gave up the chase. I was so worried about John, though! He was far behind me, and now the dogs were all riled up and ready for the next biker. I was sure they were going to eat him. But he came down the hill after me with the pack barking madly behind him. He says they ran along on both sides of his bike but didn't nip at him. Guess I put the fear in 'em! Grrr! Seriously - it was a horrible experience - I felt nauseated and dizzy and angry. I only wish an 18-wheeler had come along at 60 miles an hour and had jumped the fence and crashed right into the front of the house, taking out the stupid, obnoxious owner. I really don't blame the dogs for being dogs - just the people for being jerks.  Later, when a shelty with a flowing, gorgeous coat came chasing out after us, flopping like a mop from a Vidal Sassoon salon, it was hard to take her quite so seriously.  On the happier side, we saw a deer farm and emus and some VERY friendly cats (we were never once chased by a vicious pack of cats.) And lots of horses and cows. Some young, teenager cows even ran along beside John in their field. Probably wished they were dogs.  We made it to Mansfield after riding through a gorgeous state park with camping on a placid lake. The city was a bit of a let-down. If it weren't so cold, and they weren't calling for rain, it would have been such a great place to camp out again. But we didn't want to risk the thunderstorms, and I wanted to do some laundry. So we went to the Holiday Inn - coin-laundry, hot tub.  The city is a little like Pittsburgh - another steel town largely dying and dirty. We tried to have dinner in the hotel's restaurant, but we were ignored for so long that we gave up and walked down the street. We discovered Cycle Night (motor, of course) at Mr T's coffee house! Mr. T's is a cool diner with good fries and batty waitresses.  So ends another day on the road. We sure could use some good weather and flat land.
Then John got another FLAT TIRE. We sat outside the East of Chicago Pizza place, in the rain, and fixed the flat.  That was all in our first five miles. We weren't even out of Mansfield. ARGH! But when we finally got out of town and got going, at least we were moving. And once we got west of Ontario, the hills started flattening out. The traffic disappeared. The riding would be wonderful it wasn't COLD AND WET. So we stopped at Moe's Minimart and gas station for some nuked lunch and the locals there steered us to the Rainbow Inn in Galion as a place to stay. We decided to cut the day short and get out of the rain. It's supposed to be SUNNY tomorrow and Sunday, so we just decided that enough was enough.  The Rainbow is a bit of a motor-lodgey dive, run by an Indian family that either doesn't speak English well or hates us. Either way, they weren't very friendly despite our attempts to chat. We both had a weird homesick sensation - we hadn't realized how WHITE Ohio has been. The lobby smelled of wonderful curry, but we were stuck with fried fish and burgers at Granny's diner. Bleah!  I'm getting kind of depressed and grumpy. All we do is eat, sleep, bike - pack, unpack - get wet, and dry off again. I'm tired and this is not fun. I'm having dreams about clothes, too. I dreamt that I had a nice, clean, sturdy pair of blue jeans. I so enjoyed the sensation of pulling them on, then I thought, "Oh, no, I can't bike in these, and they're too heavy and bulky to pack. Where's a post office? I have to mail them home!" In another dream, I'm in a Victoria's Secret, and I'm picking out new bras and underwear - they all fit so nicely and smell so clean, in a wide variety of fabrics and designs  I'm losing my mind. BEWARE BIKES OUT FRONT  I think it's so nice when we pass yards with piles of bikes out front - we've passed quite a few. Kid's bikes, grown-up bikes, old-fashioned grandma and grandpa bikes. Some look like the owners dropped them there a moment before and ran around back. Some are rusted with weeds entwined in the spokes. Some have weathered "For Sale" signs propped in front, and some are accompanied by villages of lawn ornaments and farm tools. I think, "Look at all of the people who bike, or at least used to" - I feel so included. We even saw one bike hung on a wall with flowers planted in the handlebar basket. Then I get the "creeping feeling" - I know what's really going on here. Evil grab bicyclists and gobble them, smacking and slurping. They burp up the indigestible penny-farthings and tandems, Huffies and hybrids, and toss them out the front door. Gangs of neighborhood children popping wheelies and biking in lazy circles - snatched in a squealing mass. Old couples with a picnic basket strapped to the back gasp in surprise but don't have time to scream. Speedy, middle-aged Lance-wannabes never even see the monster coming, their heads down, pedalling with all their might.  Sometimes after a tasty meal, Mrs. Ogre takes the time to arrange the leftover bikes as planters. Sometimes Mr. Ogre feels industrious and frugal, and decides to try to sell them - perhaps this will even encourage more prey to pedal by!  So next time you're out on your bike, and happen to pass a mysterious pile of bikes in someone's front yard, keep your eye on the front door, and whatever you do, don't stop to take pictures.
We talked to a nice family in Nevada, out enjoying the weather on their front porch. Then we got to the Amerihost - and called the bike shop. Bud Miller came and got us, even though he was closed for the weekend. He fixed John's spoke, trued the wheel, and cleaned out and repacked the bearings - incredibly kind of him. He invited us to his church tomorrow. After we got cleaned up, we biked to the drug store and dropped off film, had dinner at The Steer Barn - obviously a popular place, and got to try exotic delicacies like pea and peanut salad and spaghetti salad. After dinner we played minigolf and picked up our photos. I suppose it wasn't that bad a day, I just feel wretched. Bleah.
We biked north to Carey - used the bathroom at a drive-in restaurant. Carey has a waterworks park that is famous locally for it's wonderful well water.  We had lunch at a gas station in Vanlue. We had trouble getting back on the route again after Vanlue, but then we made it into Findlay (where I had to make another emergency bathroom stop at an equestrian center on the outskirts of town) and got a room at the Hawthorne Inn and Suites. We had dinner at the Diamond River steak house - it was okay.  Still grumpy, despite the gorgeous weather and lovely tailwind. I think we're taking tomorrow off, so maybe a rest will help.

We rented a pick up truck from Enterprise again and dropped the bikes off for a tune up - my front derailer is rubbing when I try to shift gears. In fact, yesterday I had quite a break-down. (Me, not the bike.) I was having some trouble with it, so stopped to try and adjust it. The more I messed with it, though, the worse it got, and I couldn't get it back to where it was when I started. John just stood there not saying anything, and I got really mad at him. I was despairing - losing all hope of finishing this trip. I missed my friends and my family, I didn't know why we needed to do this, I didn't have the strength or courage to keep going, and John just stood there. I felt like I had been helping him to go on, to get moving everyday, but he didn't do anything to encourage me or help me through my despair. So I cried and yelled at him. I felt so lonely and wanted to go home. We talked, and he tried to be more encouraging and helped me get my bike in workable order, and on we went. It did get me thinking about what my friendships mean to me - I love John, and I really like our relationship - but he is not an extrovert, and I need more human interaction than just one introverted guy - even though I'm an introvert, too, there's something really valuable I get from my girlfriends. Besides, I'm PMS-ing.  Anyway, we went to Fazoli's for lunch, again. Then at the library I got some great internet time and John found some places for us to stay over the next few days. We have to alter our route somewhat because the Ohio maps only show camping, and the temp. goes into the 40's at night and they're calling for continued rain. No way, man. After the library, I called mom and we had a nice long talk. John went to a used book store - Books on Main - and got himself two books. Then we tried the new book store - B. Dalton - because I'm reading a couple of series that are newer and aren't in used book stores yet, and they didn't have anything I was looking for! We're spoiled by Borders. I bought underwear - see, I started out with underwear, but when the bike rash got bad, and the elastic just seemed to make it worse, I mailed them home and got some boxers at the mall in McKeesport. Then a few days ago, I started having some menstrual spotting, and needed to deal with that - which doesn't work well with boxers. So we went to K-Mart and bought some regular underwear again - I was almost stuck with turquoise tiger striped. It was the only package in my size, until I found one package of white on the wrong peg. Why on earth would anyone design turquoise tiger striped underwear?! I certainly don't ever remember seeing any turquoise tigers, and I watch animal planet all the time. We picked up our bikes - they replaced my cable, but pointed out that the last time John changed his tire, it didn't seat properly and it's worn the sidewall a bit. The said it MIGHT blow, or it might not. So helpful! Guess we'll find out, won't we? Then we went and had dinner at Japan West, an excellent Japanese steak house (In Findlay! Go figure!). I had a combo of salmon, swordfish, and scallops, each with a different sauce. John had chicken. After dinner, we tried to get John a new cell phone - his got wet in the rain and isn't working. But the Verizon stand in the mall only sells to new customers - she was quite rude to us. Theory: they have absolutely crappy customer service because you're stuck with a two year contract and they don't seem worried about keeping customers after they squeeze out the two years. Then we went and saw Shrek - cute movie. Silly and sweet. Back at the hotel, I got some hot-tub time and we turned in. Tomorrow we're back on the road, heading west!
No rain today, despite ominous cloud cover. As we biked, we rode right out from under them into partly sunny skies! Haven't seen that in a while! Saw more farms, but also some forest preserve - first time we've seen large stands of trees in Ohio. We passed a park with an historic, restored farm house, with all of the outbuildings. Stopped to use the restrooms and look around. Also, passed an 1880 brick church that's for sale! Hmmm... We rode through Gilboa and stopped to take a picture of Stinky's bar - thought Steve and Michele would like that. At a farmer's market, we got supplies for a picnic, but we made it to Ottowa before lunch, so we'll save the picnic for later. Both Ottowa and Gilboa were founded in the 1830's, settled on land newly wrested from the Native Americans. They seem so depressed and poor - as far as I can tell, the only reason they're here is that they were along the railroad. Ottowa has some lovely little Victorian homes, and a factory. We're staying at the Lee Bell Motel, a dinky motor lodge - the only accomodations in town. The next place is thirty-five miles away - not sure we could make it today. The menu for Henry's, posted on a board in the motel office, looked enticing, so we biked there for lunch. But they'd changed their menu, and it was crowded and the food was mediocre. Similar to a Benigan's type place. We biked back to the Lee Bell and took a nap. I'm amazed how exhausted we are from such a short day of biking. We had a strong head-wind the whole way - gusting up to 25 mph, and I suppose that really takes it out of you. Wind is like invisible hills. John composed what I am sure is the first ever Irish song about biking in Ohio. He sang happily about biking into the wind, and I huffed and puffed and pedaled. Crazy man. After our nap, we went for a walk all over town and waved at people. The sign outside the elementary school read, "He who expects nothing is never disappointed." Perhaps the public education system should avoid irony. We had dinner at Burger King and bought some playing cards. Back in our room, we played rummy. I called my friend, Gemma and had a wonderful talk with her - catching up and hearing her voice. Tomorrow, we're aiming for Paulding, Ohio, where we'll meet up with the Adventure Cycling maps. Then the day after that should be our last day in Ohio. Indiana, here we come!
We're still biking into a head-wind, but despite weather channel predictions, we dodged rain for another day. In fact, the skies were gorgeous. We rode through Glandorf, Ohio, a tiny town with a gargantuan, towering steeple on the Catholic Church and a large garden grotto. More wind, more wind, more wind... slammed by gusts, grateful for every stand of trees in this wide, flat, empty farmland.  In Grover Hill, we stopped in a filthy, cluttered filling station and convenience store, because a sign in the window advertised Skin So Soft, the Avon bug repellent that works so well. Also, needed to use the bathroom. I think it was worse than an outhouse, though. Worse than an all guy garage bathroom. Icky. The woman went digging in boxes for the Skin So Soft, and was gone for a long time. When she finally emerged, she produced a dusty bottle and sold it to me for $2 off. We thought we'd stop in Haviland for a picnic lunch, but as we biked through town, everything on main street was boarded up, no little parks or any benches, and the sky was looking darker. We got to where we needed to turn north for Paulding, and decided to race the rain - no place to stop for shelter, so we biked with all our might. Now with the wind behind us, smooth pavement under our tires, and not a car as far as we could see, we flew down the road at 20 mph! What an absolute rush! Effortless! Exhilerating! We biked into town and turned left - a few doors down and we were in the driveway of the Bittersweet Inn - just as big rain drops began to splat around us. We made it! Then we decided to unload our packs and bike the mile into town for lunch at the Red Owl Inn. Got a bit rained on , but not much. After a typical burger lunch, we stopped at the mini-mart to stock up for dinner and breakfast - the Bittersweet is just an inn, not a B&B. We took leisurely baths, read lots of magazines, and played scrabble on the porch, watching the sun set in the moody Ohio sky. I've thought a lot about porches on our trip through Ohio. We're so vulnerable to the elements out here. And there really is nothing but private property as far as we can see - no place to rest or take shelter except people's houses or barns or garages. But our culture does not welcome the wanderer  - signs everywhere say, "DO NOT ENTER" "PRIVATE PROPERTY" "NO TRESPASSING" "KEEP OUT" "TRESPASSERS WILL BE PROSECUTED TO THE FULL EXTENT OF THE LAW." What is everyone so afraid of? No one invites the stranger to come and sit, rest and chat. The isolation feels like a prison. I expected to find communities, see gathering places, encounter those places where everyone knows everyone. Instead, we've seen so much empty, disconnected, abandoned, fenced off space. I suppose I'm not much of a typical American - the "rugged individualist." If I had a wide, wrap-around porch with rocking chairs and hanging flower baskets, I'd sit on it and wave to all who went by. I'd beckon to the walkers, the bikers, or any wayfarer, offer a glass of water, or a snack or something. Where are you headed? Where are you from? I'm the one travelling, but I find myself asking all the questions whenever we find people. Whatcha farming? When was the town founded? Who built this old farmhouse? Has it been in your family? Well, so we pass porch after porch, watch the looming sky and move on - not a welcome mat in sight. Didn't Jesus say something like, "the fox has his den and the bird has his nest, but the son of man has no place to rest his head?" I suppose this is just another part of exploring our homelessness. We realize how much space everyone has and refuses to share. We've stood under a few porches when rain got to be too much - but we always felt like we'd have to move along quickly if anyone showed up - shot-gun in hand, sicing a pack of dogs on us, shouting, "Get off my property."
Wen we turned west on Monroeville Road, we biked right out from under the rain and the wind was mostly at our backs. What a lovely welcome to another state. We came into Monroeville, the first town on the Adventure Cycling maps through which we're passing, and everyone was so friendly and greeted us warmly. People actually waved from their porches! Seems they really like bikers, here. We had a nice lunch at the Village cafe where we realized that we'd crossed a time zone and gained an hour! The only problem is that we are soaked to the bones and it's 60 degrees - quite chilly when wet. Can't seem to get warm. But the ham and beans were delicious. After lunch, the rain stopped altogether, but the wind shifted and biking was harder. In Hoagland, I took a pitstop at an elementary school. The office lady even let me use the grown-up bathroom. The kids had a good time staring at the weird biker lady. Too bad it wasn't Friday - we missed beach dress-up day! Three miles before the hotel, we passed a Methodist church firing up oil-drum barbecues for a chicken dinner. But by the time we reached the Country Inn Motel, we decided we wouldn't be heading back down the road. We're tired and sore, and this place, although technically with an address of Middletown, IN, has no town in sight and is on a large, divided highway. It'd be difficult to bike down and back. I kind of wish we'd gone, but know how tired and sore we are. We can only do so much in a day. This place is pretty disgusting - dusty, smoky and mildewed, but it's dry and cheap. We ordered delivery and watched TV. Tomorrow there should be a Comfort Inn with a pool and laundry. Oh, the excitement never ceases! THE SERMON - INDIANA You know, you begin to think metaphorically when you're pushing a bike uphill in a cold rain, leaning into a 10 mph head-wind, drenched and muddy, frozen stiff, chased by dogs, chased by people off of their porches when you try to shelter from hail and lightening, nothing anywhere as far as you can see and no where to go to the bathroom except wide open corn fields that this early in the year provide privacy for your ankles. You think, over and over again like a mantra, THIS IS HELL. And heaven? Heaven would be a flushing toilet with a door. A towel. Chocolate cake. Seeing your mom. Clean underwear. Just these things - any one of them, would be just like heaven. At least that's what I do. Then I think WHY am I doing this?! I could go back to Maryland any time and end the torment - no more rain or dogs or wind or dirt. Oh yes, I went on this trip partly to better understand the true meaning of life, to disconnect myself from the material world and my many possessions, from the things of "this world," and to find out what is truly most essential in life. Toilet paper comes to mind. Seriously, I realize all my thoughts are about my physical, personal circumstances and really have little to do with heaven and hell as I believe them to exist (when I take the time to think about them). I believe true hell is separation from God, true heaven - his presence. I realize what makes this rain and cold and wind and hills hellish (besides being thoroughly unpleasant) is that they trap my mind and separate me from a focus on finding God. I came out here to minimize distractions, and find that they grow like corn. I bet the prophets in the wilderness spent a lot of time thinking, "Wow, it's hot. And I'm hungry. Nothing but sand as far as the eye can see." They probably wrote lots of poems about stinky sand in between the wonderful epiphanies and visions. So truly, it is a hellish trip when I can't get my mind off of my bike-seat rash, or when I focus all of my attention on what cable channels our latest hotel offers. When I am reduced to the avoidance of personal discomfort and the pursuit of material relief, I get depressed and discouraged, disillusioned and lost. So the trip west, away from my possessions also needs to be a trip inward and outward spiritually - reaching beyond wherever I am, to continue searching, to continue yearning for more. "As the hart panteth after brooks So my soul panteth after thee, O God. My soul thirsteth for God, for the living God; When shall I come and appear before God?  My tears have been my meat day and night... Deep calleth unto deep at the noise of thy waterspouts; All thy waves and thy billows are gone over me. Yet the Lord will command his lovingkindness in the daytime,  In the night his song shall be with me... Why art thou cast down, O my soul? And why art thou disquieted within me? Hope thou in God; for I shall yet praise him,  Who is the health of my countenance, and my God." (Psalm 42)
As we neared Huntington - about five miles out of town, The wind suddenly changed direction, whipping around to blow in our faces. It changed to a buffet, it sounded as if the trees were being beaten, and the clouds in front of us was an angry dark blue. We stopped in front of a farm house, wondering if we should seek shelter, and in answer the sky cracked and lit up with massive lightning and thunder. We scurried onto the porch. It looks like it's a new house, not occupied yet, and still a little under construction. We got comfortable and waited. First the trees began bending over, then the world darkened. The rain began, and soon was gushing. Pea-sized hail pelted the ground. Lightning and thunder traded back and forth. It certainly was nice to be under a porch - this was definitely not something to bike in. We leaned against the house and felt hemmed in by the wall of water falling - as it tapered to a shower, we watched birds and squirrels come out and explore. Then just as the rain slowed to a sprinkle, a young man pulled up in a pick-up truck. We said, "Howdy! Thought we'd hide under your porch while the storm passed. Hope you don't mind. We even got some hail!" He responded with a grunt. He seemed quite grumpy and said nothing, just went into the house. We shuffled off the porch into the rain.  We had to leave the bike map to go into Huntington. Of course, the road we'd chosen started out as gravel - ominous. But we decided to give it a chance, and it soon became pavement. Riverside Road is quite a lovely ride into town. We stopped at a Mexican restaurant for lunch and had quite delicious tacos, burritos, and corn fries. They carded me! I thought that was quite funny.  We biked on to the hotel - clean, nice, large, BIG SIGH IF RELIEF! The woman at the front desk gave us a ride to the library, because the town's big enough to be too big for walking, and small enough to be too small for cabs. Her mother works at the library, so she didn't mind swinging by there. We looked online for places to stay in Indiana. Then we walked back - lots of huge victorian houses in varying states of preservation, dilapidation, and repair. We did our laundry and watched T.V., ordered dinner from a delivery place. It's hard to explain - I know this day doesn't seem too much different from the others, but I started having one of my anxiety attacks. I get stuck in a thought cycle that leaves me panicked, I get a headache, have trouble breathing and nausea. My thoughts we like this - "What are we doing? This trip is pointless. A three month waste of time. We're not doing anything worthwhile, we're just spending thousands of dollars to piddle around on bikes - exhaust ourselves, eat horribly, see no one, accomplish nothing. This is not fun. This is not building our relationship. I'm not writing. We're not even going to make it across country. So what are we doing? I want to go home NOW. I want to see everyone and stop wasting time and money just to be miserable and lonely. I'm sick of this - different motel, different restaurant, different strangers, having to explain over and over again this stupid, crazy thing we're doing." So I got myself totally freaked out, depressed, and panicked. Usually when this happens, I can't sleep - but at least biking does one thing - I have very little trouble with insomnia. Let's just say I ended this day NOT A HAPPY CAMPER.
And we're both SICK nigh unto death of riding in crappy weather! But I think both our moods greatly improved from a good night's sleep, and a great conversation. We're not sure what we'll do after Chicago - I can't even force my mind to consider continuing - but at least we feel more of a prospect of enjoying the remainder of the journey.  Today we're riding along route 24, a divided highway that runs about 10 miles south of the Adventure Cycling route. There's much less to see while riding, but all of the towns and hotels are along 24. They're still calling for rain and windchills in the 30's! So we don't feel much like camping along the bike route. This part of Indiana, along the Little Wabash  and Wabash River is quite hilly, forested and pretty. We stopped at the Hoosier Pride Caf in the town of Wabash for lunch. A family at the table next to us listened with awe and wonder to their grown son describe the fabled Krispy Kreme donuts. He'd been to a far away land where they had some, and they could barely believe such a miracle as HOT FRESH NOW. We sat and salivated. Then the rain began. We waited until it tapered off somewhat, then got back on the road. Still, we were drenched in a short time, and so cold. After Wabash, we left main route 20 on old County Road 24 and we wove along the Wabash between farms and factories, each with it's own unique smell. The rain stopped for a little while, long enough to dry out. As we entered Peru, we needed a bathroom badly. First we passed a really ugly campground, no luck there. Farther on we stopped at a sparsely stocked convenience store and bait shop - the woman claimed that the restroom was out of order, but she seemed to not like us much. Peru was not shaping up to much. Finally we stopped at a beverage store, again, no luck, but we were right next to a little movie theater. EVERYONE in town must've been at the movies - a rainy Saturday - so we went and used their bathrooms. John called the Rosewood Manor B&B for directions. We had no idea what to expect - after campgrounds and bait-shops, this place could call anything a B&B. Things began to look up as we entered the historic downtown - fixed up old houses, tree-lined streets, a ton of old churches, a stately courthouse - JIM"S BOOKS & BEANS, a coffee and used book shop - we're in HEAVEN! Then we turned down a side street and up the driveway of the Rosewood Manor. What a gorgeous sight! Two  mansions  sit across a driveway from each other, late 1800 buildings, surround by lush landscaping. We arrived just as everyone was checking in, so we got to look around a bit while we waited. Stained-glass windows on the 2nd and 3rd levels flood the entry and curving staircase with richly colored light. The sitting room is paneled and lined with inset book shelves behind glass doors. There's a cozy fireplace, too, appropriate for an unseasonably chilly day. The dining room is in one of the towers, so it's round with lots of cubby holes set into the walls. The butler's pantry is set up with a nice selection of coffee, tea and sodas. There are two other main floor rooms that seem to be set up for a meeting. In the hall, antique store cabinets display a whimsical collection of old tows and books and needlepoint samplers. Locally made artwork and furniture also fill the hall, all for sale. Our room is in the Carriage house, one of the newly renovated outbuildings. It's quite large, with a monstrous whirlpool tub, all our own. The bed linens are luxurious brocade, the room is quiet and secluded. Now THIS is fun. We bathed and changed and walked back down the street to the book shop. It started to pour again just as we arrived. So we had a wonderful afternoon waiting out the rain and talking to the owners. John got a soda and lemon crunch pie, I had vanilla decaf coffee and strawberry rhubarb pie. We savored the books, as well. Jim and his father-in-law were busy making a racket, building book shelves. Tawnya ran the coffee counter, and talked to a table full of locals. A tornado watch came over the radio - one was spotted touching down five miles north of here, near where Jim and Tawnya's daughter was hanging out. She didn't seem too concerned, simply made a phone call to make sure she stayed put. I bought a collection of short stories by Flannery O'Conner and an old, tiny edition of Longfellow's Tales of a Wayside Inn. Thought it seemed appropriate for a journey.  When the rain stopped, we headed back down the street and spotted a Circus Museum. We hopped under their awning just as the rain began again, and discovered that the place was closed today. So we sat on the steps and waited. I read the poem out loud to John - it's quite romantic and fun. The rain slowed, so we began walking towards the Grant's Bar & Grill, which had been recommended for dinner, but we only made it partway, before we were getting drenched, so we ducked under someone's porch. No one greeted us or chased us away, so we stood and read some more. Finally, we made it to dinner only slightly soggy, and had a fine dinner of real yuppy food! Portabello mushrooms and such. After dinner, we strolled back to the B&B. A full rainbow glowed against the navy blue clouds, wrapping the thin spike of a church steeple. Of course we didn't have the camera. So we just soaked up the scene with our minds - then walked on. As we reached the church, we read the sign out front - "It takes both sunshine and rain to make rainbows." So how did the Lutherans manage to arrange that confluence of natural occurances? Wow! We sat in the cozy sitting room, reading and sipping tea, and talked to the other guests as they came and went. There's a large group of folks here from California - come to Peru to find their roots. It's a bit of a family reunion. One man got quite animated talking to John about computers. He's been in the field since 1966, and hates it. He lives in Los Angeles and hates cities. Hmmm!  All in all, this has been a lovely day - the weather has not improved, but at least we met people and had some adventures, and get to stay in this lovely place. And besides, a book store fixes everything!
After breakfast, we walked to the Anglican church to find out what Mattins are. We arrived a few minutes late, and were the only attendees. The priests stood in front of the altar and prayed - chanting, reading scriptures, and singing. I'm sure we were supposed to stand and kneel at certain times, and read along, but we had no idea what to do when, so we watched. Afterwards, one priest came to talk to us. He was very kind, and once he ascertained that we were TOTAL heathens (not anglican or episcopalian) he invited us to stay for mass and to come forward and receive a blessing during the eucharist. That's the polite way of informing us that we are not to take communion. Turns out this berobed, bearded man straight out of medieval times is from Oxon Hill MD. Small world! We stayed another hour - mass had a few more attendees - all old women. But at least this time we could follow their lead and participate in the service.  So by the time we got on the road, it was after 11 a.m., and we only got in 10 miles of biking before the rain started again. It had been sunny all morning. Oh well. We stopped for lunch at Fazoli's in Logansport. The road was exceptionally crappy through that town, and coming into town there had been some treacherous, shoulderless, winding hills. So we sat in the restaurant and rested, and watched the rain come down in sheets, and ate breadsticks. The hills here are such a surprise, and the forests. Not how I always pictured Indiana.  After lunch, the road improved greatly past Logansport. We went through the tiny towns of Burnettsville and Idaville. Idaville had a tall grain silo that we could see from miles away. I pretended it was a high-rise apartment building and felt so comforted. Weird! I suppose I'm more freaked out by the sparse population than I realized. I found the idea of hundreds of people living on top of each other so reassuring.  We stopped in Burnettsville for a snack. Then we got to Monticello mostly dry - it had stopped raining a while back. But we were tired and sore. We're staying at the Victoria B&B, but we're the only people here tonight, so no other guests to chat with. We walked a mile or so up the road to find dinner - not much open on a Sunday night. We ate at the Taco Bell - seems to be THE hang-out place. Lots of teens there, and one old couple had a 10 pak of tacos and sat reading novels at a table beside us.  We went to the grocery store and stocked up on camp food. It's been a week since we took a day off from biking, so we might need one soon, But we're only two days away from where we'll quit and rent a truck to drive into Chicago. I'd like to keep going if we can. Then we get a whole week off! Or forever! Although we've heard about an historic amusement park here in Monticello that might also be fun to check out. So we'll see how we feel in the morning. Thus ends week four on the road!

While the weather IS gorgeous to look at, we're fighting a steady headwind, and the road surface is deteriorating. It's a bumpy, exhausting ride. But the road along Lake Shafer towards Monon has some lovely views. The like is lined with woods and vacation cabins - lots of campers and fishermen. We biked along with another couple for a while. They're locals, and bike regularly.  When we arrived in Monon, the town was getting all gussied up for their big Food Fest - NEXT weekend. We miss all the good stuff. The water tower was being sheathed with drop cloth - suppose it was about to receive a new coat of paint. We had lunch at La Macarena - very authentic, spicy, and good. Fresh salsa, guacamole, corn tortillas, and chorizo. Delicious!  Once back on the road, we discovered that the land west of Lake Shafer is the fabled flat midwest - not a ripple in the land for miles around. We had another bad run-in with dogs - two blood hounds and a chihuahua. Actually, the Chihuahuas are funny - they bark so ferociously and run right past our bikes. Speedy little rat-dogs! When we turned west on the road that would take us into Rensselaer, I posited that these wide open spaces with no one around for miles and miles were creepy - that living in the country would be scary. John disagreed - he thought that the city was much scarier - that people in the country were so much more friendly and trustworthy. I said, no way - in the city, there were lots of people, and you could call the police if something happened. Out here, some nutso could do terrible things and there was no accountability. John was just saying how it's better to have LESS people, because there're less people to do terrible things, when a blue and white van sped by us and he screamed in pain and anger. A million thoughts ran through my head - foremost I was convinced the van had hit John, and I tried in vain to see the license plate before turning to see what they had done. It had to have been going over fifty mph. I turned, and John had stopped and was holding his head. He said they'd thrown something at him and it had hit him in the back of the head. I looked, and sure enough there was a curved dent on his helmet, and a curved cut on his scalp. Whatever they'd thrown had managed to find the spot just below where his helmet would have protected him. I looked around on the ground and found a AA battery - that was the most likely suspect - the curve in the helmet and on his head we just the size of the battery's end. We were so angry and shaken, but there was just nothing we could think of to do about it. John felt okay to keep biking. So we continued on, but I cried, frustrated and scared. I certainly did not enjoy being right in this discussion. In a few miles we came to an abandoned old school building - two stories, brick, ivy covered. The flag was still flying beside it, faded and tattered. John wanted a photo, so we stopped. An old man rushed out to chat. He said, "Are you taking pictures of my school?" He was quite hospitable. He owns the land and the building, and lives in a trailer out back. It was built in 1929 and housed the primary school for the township of Hanging Gardens until 1965. Then his father bought it and used it for his non-denominational church until 1985. After the church disbanded, the building was used for storage until it fell so far into disrepair that it become structurally unsafe - now it's boarded up, and he must keep trespassers out for their own good. After his father died and he retired, he moved into the trailer that had been the parsonage, and has lived there ever since. His name is John Eaton, and after being stationed in Germany in the military as a young man, he became a school teacher. He taught in several different states and in a DOD school near Darmstadt, Germany. What a small world - I attended the DOD school in Berlin for five years. He invited us to have a snack or a drink - he even invited us to stay with him, and told us stories about the bikers and hikers he's rescued in various states of breakdown and exhaustion. We thanked him, but decided to move on, because Rensselaer was only eight miles away, and the next day would be a long one.  We continued on and stopped at a church to use the bathroom. Looks like they have a cool coffee house on Friday nights, but of course we're here on a Monday. We called The White House B&B to see if they had a room available. Turns out that they hadn't planned on taking any guests because their daughter was due to have her baby any minute - in fact, she'd been in labor all weekend and was now 2 cm dialated. But they told us to come anyway - they'd love to have us, they just might need to leave at any time. They are a very nice couple - Tim & Beth Ryan. She's a psychologist and he's a professor at the local college - St. Joseph's. It's an exquisite house, richly decorated. We got all settled in and then chatted with Tim and Beth for a while. Tim was furious when he heard what had happened to John. He almost yelled at us for not having called the police. I said, "But I didn't get the license plate number. What good would it have done?" "They wouldn't need the license plate number - there wouldn't be that many blue vans on that road." So I see a flaw in my city-is-better theory. I think Tim just couldn't believe anyone in his county would do such a thing. We met their neurotic Dalmatian - they kept it locked in the garage while they were gone, because it's been scared of strangers ever since it was beaten by a plumber. I suppose Tim shouldn't be so shocked - evil lurks in the hearts of men everywhere (okay, okay, and women, too.) Poor doggy. We petted her, but she shivered and seemed really nervous. St. Joseph's is a catholic college that offers accredited degrees in many subjects, with a strong emphasis in all majors on the study of human history and civilization. A solid third of their coursework, no matter what their major is, is devoted to a strict order of classes in history, culture, and social science. We walked over and had dinner at Devon's Family restaurant, then walked around campus - lovely lawns and old buildings. After a long soak in the whirlpool tub back at the B&B, we called it a night.
Tim & Beth weren't around, so we went and had breakfast at Devon's. Then we biked to the library and got some internet time. This library is brand new, very clean and nice, and hyper-controlling about their computers. We had to turn in our driver's licenses. The library lady took our license and picked out a plastic baggy marked for our computer. She pulled out the mouse ball, dropped in the license, and walked over to the computers. She installed the ball and left us to ponder the menacing posters surrounding the computer - listing all of the things we were NOT TO DO on the internet. SCARY.  After that we explored the Carnegie Center, a lovely old building that had been the library for many years until it was quite run down. So the library moved, and this was renovated and converted into an arts center. We enjoyed looking at the woodwork and stained glass. They did a great job! We had a snack on the court house lawn - the building is in the center of the town's main square. A woman had a Chicago-style hot dog stand. Delicious! Also, there was a bakery. We went back to the room and read for a while, bathed and napped. For dinner, we decided to bike back to the square and try out the City Office & Pub - it was quite a lively place for a Tuesday. So that was our day off. Tomorrow, we have 50 miles of biking, and then we should be in Chicago!  Here's a line from Longfellow - helpful to keep in mind as we struggle against the yucky weather. "The farmers grew impatient, but a few  Confessed their error and would not complain, For after all, the best thing one can do  When it is raining is to let it rain."
The weather is gorgeous today, not a cloud in the sky, not too hot, AND (drum-roll please...) a 10mph TAIL WIND! The road is flat as a pancake. Who could ask for anything better? We stopped for a rest in front of the place I call "The Curious Farm" - a horse, two ponies, cows, geese, a cat, and a child in the farmhouse window all stared at us! It was quite funny - everything just stopped and peeked - through fence rails, over grass clumps, through curtains. The cat even sauntered down the driveway and up onto a concrete slab to have a better view. We waved at the child, but he just ducked below the sill. Curiouser and curiouser. A few miles before the border with Illinois, the road suddenly became quite good. New asphalt, new lines, and wide shoulders. Then at the state line, it was like a wall - the Illinois side of the road wasn't marked and was chunky, dilapidated asphalt. We thought it was quite funny that Indiana had gone to all the trouble to make its roads look good next to Illinois. This was the middle of nowhere - who cares? And Indiana's roads had been so bad most of the way. Very funny. We biked through more and more corn fields - a red wing black bird even got bold enough to dive-bomb my helmet. Wishes he were a chihuahua. In Beaverville, a little town with two roads of houses and a grain mill, we encountered the odd sight of a massive catholic cathedral - St. Mary's Church, currently under renovation, the Romanesque revival building with Munich style stained glass windows depicting the life of Mary was built at the turn of the century. It has an impressive dome, and the opalescent glass is quite striking. We spent some time inside and had a snack on the front steps. It was strange, though, everryone I said "Hello," too, just stared as if I  was from Mars. When we got into the Kankakee metro area, we encountered sprawling suburbs and busy, city-style streets. Ah, Urbanity! The first township through which we passed was called Aroma Park, which John found very funny. They had a smiley face on their water tower, and odd little road signs and shop signs - trying to be a quaint small-townish community. Hooray for them. We got into the city way too early - our truck wasn't supposed to be available until 5 p.m., and it was only two. We stopped at a fast food place called "Poor Boys" and basked in the racial diversity - lots of people, lots of colors. I wonder how hard it will be to adjust to the whiteness of Ireland. I am so glad we were raised in diverse cultures. I'd rather be used to "otherness," and find "monoculture" strange than vice-versa. Anyway, we decided, after a long rest, and trying something called "Italian style beef" which seemed to mean "salty," to bike on up to the Enterprise place. We were at the end of our energy - it'd been a long ride, despite the good conditions, and the city streets were harrowing. But we made it to the place and collapsed. And lo and behold - they had a truck ready early. Yay! So we dumped the bikes and gear in the back and got on the road - north to Chicago! Oh, what a feeling! We got to Saundra's, tired, hungry, dirty, weary of soul. We went and got some dinner then came back and collapsed, in the company of our friends and their cats. As far as I'm concerned, I'm never leaving.


But John is ready to go.  So we packed up the extra clothes we'd bought here in Chicago - tennis shoes, jeans, sweaters - and mailed them home. Then we returned the truck to an Enterprise office north of the city, in Northbrook, and loaded up the bikes. And we're off again. We had lunch at a Shaky's-style place called Barnaby's, full of kids. I suppose they're having end of school parties. Then we biked north along a paved trail running along the power lines. The hum is a little scary. But at least we're avoiding traffic, which we can hear through the brush. When the trail ended, we headed east towards Lake Michigan through a gorgeous neighborhood of mansions on wooded lots, called Lake Bluff. We crossed a little bridge in the woods where an artist from Maine had her easle set up - she was painting a picture of some tree trunks, because of the contrast of lights and darks. An old gentleman from Lake Forest, another neighborhood, was talking to her. We stopped to chat for a minute, and also met a friendly dog. (Surprise, surprise.)  We picked up another trail, this time crushed limestone, that headed north again. Now the trail passes right through neighborhoods and towns - these are old suburbs of Chicago, one after another. We passed the Great Lakes Naval training base. It was run-down, seedy and disgusting. I was surprised at the dilapidation - I would have thought that they'd try to maintain somewhat of a clean image for the public. But the buildings are old and ugly, the train station liked positively third world, and there was broken glass and discarded underwear on the trail. We also passed a jogging group of new recruits, being yelled at and driven to red-faced exhaustion. I think we all exchanged puzzled looks, asking each other, "Why on earth are you doing THAT?!" I suppose biking across country doesn't make much sense either. Next we passed through North Chicago, an exclusively black neighborhood. Then Waukegan, all Hispanic, then Beach Park, all white - with Hispanic people building the new homes. I was surprised at the level of segregation. Race relations must be fun, here. I suppose at home the same sort of thing happens, I just never noticed it. The neighborhoods we've lived in have always been mixed - more socioeconomic segregation than racial. But P.G. county has been unique, I suppose, and is well on it's way to becoming wholly black, with the steady white flight. More important to us, though, was that as we passed through the rainbow of neighborhoods, we did not pass a single place to use the bathroom or to eat. All houses, rolling on and on. In Zion we left the trail and headed towards the lake in search of someplace to pit-stop. Nothing, nothing, nothing. We're exhausted, hungry, shaky, and having trouble steering. We spotted the department of health office. I thought, 4:30 on a Wednesday, they have to be open. And there were cars in the parking lot. But NO - not open. Next door was a "rehab and care center," an alarm sounded when I entered. The woman at the front desk was kind enough to let me use the bathroom, after explaining the elaborate ritual for retrieving the hidden key. The staff was entirely young black people, caring for a bunch of senile, smelly old white people. I think I would have some major resentment issues with that situation. I hope they are very well paid, but I doubt it.  Once back on the bike trail, we were still looking for food. Still nothing. Another mile, and we're in WISCONSIN! The first person to pass us said, "Hello!" and we realized how long it had been since someone had greeted us in return, instead of scowling at us suspiciously. Also, we were greeted by a swarm of bionic mosquitoes. OUCH! We stopped so John could call the hotel and get directions - good thing, too, because Mapquest was wrong again. It'll be five or six more miles than we thought. I frantically slathered on some Skin-So-Soft, and we kept moving. We came to route 165 and turned west, biking through Pleasant Prairie - the town's name ironically painted in happy colors on the water tower, in the midst of an ocean of factories and warehouses belching smoke into the gray air. Pleasant indeed. We passed the Jelly Belly jelly bean factory, but they didn't look open for dinner. Still no food! We passed through more neighborhoods, then arrived at the interstate, off of which towered the Radisson Hotel!! Heaven! We checked into a lovely room and had a satisfying dinner in their restaurant, sat in the hot tub for a while, and then went to bed. So we survived getting back on the road. I certainly hope Wisconsin isn't wall to wall factories and mosquitoes, though. If so, then I'm not leaving the Radisson
The B&B turned out to be right across the street from the library - a nice victorian with gorgeous gardens and bird feeders of all kinds. The owner, Sandy Collins, gave us great books on B&B's in Wisconsin, bike trails, scenic roads, etc. Also, she told us about the Taste of Waterford festival starting tonight at the St. Thomas Aquinas Church. We got cleaned up and walked over there for hot dogs and ribs and cream puffs. There was live country music and crafts and a garden show, too. The beer tent was already lively early in the evening. The sky had turned stormy by now, but it never rained on us. So with a lovely ride through the countryside, friendly people, and good food, this turned out to be quite a wonderful day!
We had hoped to find more fun festivals and such going on over the weekend - it's Friday today. But it doesn't look like anything is going on near up until Sunday. We biked west on a winding road through dairy farms and neighborhoods. Just outside of Waterford we came across a petting farm, loaded with buses and elementary kids. I begged John to let us stop, and he didn't mind. Everyone asked about our trip, and I had a wonderful time petting goats and chicks and ducklings and a baby cow named nutmeg. They had turkeys and sheep and lamas and everything. It was a little sad, though. I'm not sure being handled by all these people is really best for the animals - some seemed quite distressed by the crowds of pawing kids. They even had a cow tied up so the kids could milk her, and they all screamed in disgust when she peed. Where  else was she supposed to go? I thought it seemed horrible. Still, I scratched a donkey behind the ears for a while when the kids were elsewhere, and he seemed to really like that.  We biked on and got the East Troy. Our plan was to stop and get picnic supplies and check out the trolley museum in town. But we biked all the way through town without seeing any markets, trollies, or signs. Nothing but houses - guess we were on the wrong road. We stopped on the outskirts of town and asked at a nursing home where we might find a market. They directed us - and we found it after surviving a huge rollercoaster hill. We stocked up for a picnic then found a much flatter route back to our road. We stopped a few miles down the road in Troy Center, a quaint little township. We ate our lunch on the steps of an historic little Methodist chapel. After Troy Center, the road is not longer maintained by the state or county. There's no description of it on our lovely bike map. So for three miles we road over an unmarked, narrow ribbon of road, with the steepest, breakneck hills we've done so far. Cars and trucks came tearing over the hills much faster than the 35 mph speed limit. I watched a van nearly squash John. The driver screached to a halt right behind him and followed close behind until they crested the hill. Quite scary! Not a safe road at all. This was the basin for Lake Lulu, with a state park and fishing area. We survived, though, and the down-hills WERE fun, if a little dizzying. The drops were so steep that as you'd come over the top of the hill, you couldn't see the road surface down the next side until you were flying down it. Wheee! Then we came into Eagle, where we'd seen another B&B listed that sounded interesting. It was only 2:30, and check in was 4 p.m. again. So we looked around town for something to do, but Eagle is quite dead. Every sho and building on main street is closed and for sale. I went into the bar to use the restroom - smoky, blaring television, video gambling machines squawking, all men drinking. Not a place that I feel like hanging out in - so we decide to find the B&B and hope they'll let us in early.  We biked a mile out of downtown over hills and torn-up, striated pavement, through construction and traffic cones to the B&B. It's an old-style replica of an 1847 Inn built nearby. It's not very landscaped, so no little garden to sit in, and no comfy chairs on the porch. We ring the bell, and the cleaning lady answers, quite flustered by our presence. She informs us that the proprietor won't be back until 4 p.m,, so we'll have to come back then. We explain that we're on bikes and that we didn't see anywhere to wait in town - she says we'll have to find somewhere. How rude! Obviously clueless about what we meant by ON BIKES. We asked her if there was a library in town, or anywhere else she might suggest, and she gives us directions to a library and shuts the door. So we unload our stuff and leave it in the grass, then bike back through the construction and hills into town.  There we discover that the "library" to which we have been sent is an historical research library only, open on Saturday mornings. It's friday. We stand there, stunned by the insensitivity and stupidity of the cleaning woman, then biked around town again in hopes of finding ANYTHING to do. Nope. So we bike BACK and sat on the floor of the porch and waited for the proprietor, not daring to knock on the door again.  Reine Herriges, the owner, showed up at 4 and was very gracious and understanding about our bike situation. She helped us bring in our stuff, showed us where the root beers are kept, and showed us where we could store our bikes out of the weather. She also directed us down the road in the other direction to a place called Old World Wisconsin - why the cleaning lady had never heard of it I can't imagine - where they have a recreated 1800's farming village and a Friday night fish fry in the historic round barn. After getting all cleaned up, we biked over for dinner, and enjoyed a lively evening with all the fried fish, roasted chicken, german potato salad, applesauce, cole slaw, pumpernickel, and potato pancakes we could eat. What fun! Also, there was apple streudel for dessert. The 1.5 mile ride to and from the B&B was quite lovely, too. The road wound through hushed pine forest, with the setting sun slanting through the columnar trees.  Back at the ranch, we talked to our parents and played some rummy in the game room. Also, we were introduced to the other guests as they came and went - Reine enjoys telling people how crazy we are. We met a honeymooning couple, too. So despite the dead town and dumb lady, this was another lovely day!
We took off and bought some salami at the fuel station and minimart in town - the maps don't show anywhere to eat for quite a ways. We headed north and west again towards Sullivan where we planned on picking up the Glacial Drummand Bike Trail. The wind was strong, blowing against our sides, and sometimes in our faces, but it's another gorgeous, sunny day. Kettle Moraine State Forest is a strange, caldera-like valley rimmed with forested hills and filled with deep fens, laced with rusty brown creeks - named things like "Scuppernong" and "Mud."  In Sullivan, we discovered quite a nice little town with a few diners, so we had lunch there, then bought trail passes at the grocer's. He's a talkative fellow who liked telling jokes about dumb Texans. We got on the trail - it's a rail to trail, covered in crushed limestone, flat, straight, and wooded. It's sheltered from the wind here, but tons of BUGS and nothing interesting to look at. BORING! So we left the trail after 8 miles, and biked the main road into Jefferson - still not overly exciting, but much faster on pavement. There was a huge hill on the edge of town crowned by a massive Catholic church and a Franciscan home for the elderly and developmentally challenged. A wending was under way at the church, with a horse and carriage outside. We got to the Rodeway Inn and collapsed, did our laundry, went for Chinese food across the street. The food was very good, but there was only one server for all of the tables, so a cameraderie developed among us as we got him to bring all of our food, drinks and checks. A woman was there with two little girls, and she initiated a guessing game with them - taking turns pretending to be someone and answering yes and no questions until the others guessed. The girls chose to be characters from Powerpuff girls and Harry Potter and some horse books they were reading until the woman got frustrated and told them they had to be real people, not made up ones. Stupid lady. We went back to the hotel and vegetated for the rest of the evening. Nothing fun going on close by, and we're tired. Good night!
I cleaned off the clay at a hose behind the stage, then John and I got some bratwursts and looked at all of the pottery. John also tried something called Kettle Corn - popcorn that was a little salty, and a little sweet - very delicious. The owner of the B&B came over when he saw our bikes - he said, "Are you the bikers?" We said yes - and he introduced himself. He had seen me on stage, and was quite impressed at my bravery. Hah! So he told us to come by the B&B whenever, so when we'd explored as much as we wanted, we headed over. It's a lovely place, and our room is on the first floor - with a "garden" theme - tasteful and whimsical. Bill and Dotti are very nice and made us feel quite at home, as did their two standard poodles. After we got cleaned up and changed, we walked back down main street and had dinner. Then headed to bed. It was another lovely day - our new philosophy on this trip is working so well. I am having so much more fun, as we focus on the places through which we pass and getting to know the people along the way. The weather improving makes a big difference, too! So that's the end of our 6th week ## NO SUCH FILE ##

We packed up, loaded up, and headed west, then north-west into the city of Madison, WI. Bill had given us an excellent bike map of the county - the best map we've had yet. The roads are rated for the quality of their pavement and shoulder, how heavily trafficked they are, and rated for best bikeability. The weather today is bright and sunny without a breath of wind - it's getting hot!! We stopped for lunch at Country Corners in Hope, WI - it was a country music and dance bar - the dance floor was crowded for with tables for the lunch crowd. The sandwiches were good.  A little farther on in the suburbs of Madison, we had to detour because of construction. We stopped at a lemonade stand in someone's driveway and had a nice chat with the family. As we stood there, by rear-view mirror fell off, and Grandpa rushed into the garage to get some electrical tape. He fixed it up for me right away. They told us the best way back to our route, and where we could find the bike path that goes straight into the city. Madison is the most bike friendly city we've ever seen. It's a beautiful, green place with large lakes in the middle. The whole city is laced with bike paths, and most major roads have dedicated bike lanes. The University of Wisconsin is located in the center of town with 40,000 students attending, so it has a very academic feel, and I'm sure that partly explains the bike-friendly atmosphere. We passed the largest bike shop on the planet, Williamson Cycle,  right on the lake, and stopped to get some more maps. Then we wandered through the city streets until we found the Howard Johnson near campus. Once we were all checked into the room and getting cozy, John discovered (drum-roll please) ANOTHER BROKEN SPOKE! This time it's on the cassette side of the back wheel, so we can't replace it ourselves. When will we learn to check the bikes over while at the bike shop? We called a taxi and rode over to the shop with the wheel in hand. They fixed it quickly and then we taxied over to the Den at University Square for "59 minute photo finishing," because one hour just isn't fast enough. We dropped off our film and then walked back to the hotel, got cleaned up, walked back to pick up the pictures, and then down to an extremely friendly Thai restaurant with icky food. Then we went to the library for some internet time.  Back at the hotel, we went to bed and watched some TV. It turns out that while we're hiding all snuggly in the room, a severe weather warning was issued for this area. We turned off the TV and looked outside- Crashing lightning! Drenching rain! Rumbling thunder! And we're warm and dry and safe, ah, it feels so good to be inside looking out on that kind of weather - hoo doggy!
After passing through some quiet suburbs, we popped out into the country. We had to fight our way over a few steep hills (Beware Twin Valley Road!) and through a stead west wind, but not a drop of rain fell on us. Also, it's cooler than yesterday, and that's a relief. In Cross Plaines ("famous for friendliness") we stopped for lunch at Culver's, a Wisconsin chain of fast food restaurants that brag, "Home of the Butter Burger." I had to ask. "What is a Butter Burger?" The woman was very nice and said, "You're not from Wisconsin, are you?" She explained it, and it's not as evil as it sounds. They simply butter and grill the roll before inserting the burger. Sounds like Britain - "but you need the butter so the ham won't fall off the bread!" After lunch, we continued on up the Black Earth Creek valley, skirting steep hills on one side. The valley floor is a wide, flat flood plane covered from one end to the other and side to side with corn, corn, corn. It's the first time we've seen such a large stretch of land dedicated to one crop. In the town of Black Earth, we saw our first "How many miles to Wall Drug" sign. It's more than 700. Don't think we'll make it that far. Mazomanie turns out to be a quaint old town, very western looking, built in the 1850's when the railroad chose to put a stop here. I can picture gun-slingers facing off at high noon on main street. Our B&B, the Walking Iron, is what Mazomanie means in the Native American language - it was their name for the train. We mailed some more stuff home from the little post office in town, then went to the library (housed in the old train station). Then we had dinner at the Old Feed Mill, a beautifully renovated stone building, serving casually elegant food. The B&B is one of my favorites so far. Dave and Karisa are a young couple with three kids, and have restored the old house with meticulous attention to detail, perfectly balancing historic accuracy and modern luxury. The brass and marble bathroom, highest quality linens (scented), hand-painted relief molding... everything contributes to the royal feeling. There's even a small video and antique book library on the third floor in a cozy alcove. The yard is small, and the Black Earth Creek borders it. May favorite details: the classical designs on the tiles inside the tub area, the statues in the bathroom, the giant, soft, scented towels, the kohler toilet with a solid wood seat and a unique vertical brass pull for flushing, the dark rose and gold color scheme of our bedroom, the hand painted gold and champagne wall paper border (Karisa did them herself), the two person whirlpool tub with dual showerheads, and the antique photos of the families that have occupied the house through the years, with historical information posted alongside.  No rain tonight. I finished reading the Moviegoer by Walker Percy. Having some trouble going to sleep - I suppose my insomnia has caught up with me - gotten used to the biking. But that's okay, I can simply lie here and soak up my luxurious surroundings. Maybe I'll even take another bath. SIGH!
We biked into Spring Green and found the main street - a little sleepy, but there's some life to it. We had lunch at The Shed - it was quite crowded, so it must be "the place." John was getting that run-down, achy feeling, so we headed over to the B&B and checked in early so he could take a nap. This is getting to be a regular occurance - one or the other of us comes down with "bikitis," and we just can't stay awake or get out of bed. I took all of the laundry, packed it in two panniers, and walked to the laundromat. It's 90 degrees, I'm in my sweatshirt - the only clean article of clothing I have, and the place is not air conditioned. And the mosquitoes are HIDEOUS. I'm wishing I'd taken Jay up on his offer to use the washer at the house, but my bright idea was that this would be faster - wash two loads at once. So I sit there and chat with a scary man from Russia - he's here in Spring Green working in a glass factory - no family, no friends, in the middle of Wisconsin, and he seems almost angry that we have enough money to take off work and bike across country. So I slap mosquitoes and will the clothes to dry fast. A boy came in to get a soda, and when he came out, some other boys came along on skateboards. One of them tried to do a stunt and smashed into the side of a car. The soda boy and I snickered together.  I got the second bright idea of the day to walk back to the B&B without my shoes on. Hmmm - hot pavement, bare skin. I hopped and skipped all the way back, then discovered that I had burned a large blister on the ball of my foot. Major DUH! Perhaps I need my feet to be in healthy condition to pedal a bike day after day? Perhaps I could have thought of that? Oh well, hopefully it will heal quickly and not hinder the biking.  The B&B has three cats - Sparky, Roo and Tigger. They're talkative and friendly, but not overly snuggly. And we committed the cardinal sin of cat-dome, we chased them around the house going, "Come-ere, kitty kitty kitty!" I'm sure they'll never let us touch them, now.  We walked to dinner (I hobbled painfully) at the oldest restaurant in Wisconsin, The Post House. When we entered, a waitress was behind the counter, on the phone. She was crying and pleading desperately with whoever was on the other end. When we entered, she hung up and ran away. Another waitress came and seated us. Then who should come to our table, but the crying waitress! She was barely under control and very distracted. I asked if everything was alright, and she ignored me and insisted on taking our drink order. We waited and waited, and she never brought anything. Finally, the other waitress came and said that our waitress had had a problem and had left, and that she couldn't read her handwriting, so we re-ordered. How strange! I know everyone has problems, but it seems as though she didn't want anyone to notice while she had a complete breakdown in front of everyone. We weren't sure what to do. But life went on and she never reappeared. So we ate and then went to explore the famous cocktail lounge, designed in the fifties by a student of Frank Lloyd Wright's. It was quite a funky, cool place. I can see where all of the sixties and seventies fashions came from. But lo and behold - the crying waitress was right outside the lounge in the patio area, crying to a fellow employee. So once again, we felt like we were intruding on her privacy, by trying to have a nice dinner and sightsee! She ran away again. So we left, feeling awkward. What an odd experience.  The walk home was more pleasant - we had the quiet streets to ourselves, and it had cooled off a little. My foot still hurts a great deal, but I can walk carefully. We listened to the sounds of a little league ball game on the outskirts of town, and made it back to the B&B before we were completely consumed by mosquitoes.
We took today off biking - we wanted to see what is called "Frank Lloyd Wright" country, and we're due for a break. We had a yummy FULL breakfast, but it was cheesy. Kelly made a Mexican Frittata and a deliciously different picante quick bread. I got the recipe for that - will have to try it out. We talked to Connie and Terri. Terri is 16 and Connie's youngest child, so she wanted to spend some quality time with her "baby" before she was all grown up.  Jay gave us a ride to House on the Rock. I looked at a book about the place, and decided that I was perfectly fine missing it. But John really wanted to see it. I should have made him look at the book. It wasn't at all what he expected, and he was quite disappointed. It's a huge, strange collection of everything imaginable, housed in dark, low-ceilinged halls that twist and climb for 2.5 miles. There were mini-circuses, doll houses, dolls, carousel animals, weapons, armor, cars, asian art, player pianos, player instruments of all kinds. What a strange man, to collect all these things. Why didn't he do something normal like bike across country? It was expensive - $20 per person. And it was old and ratty and shabby and dusty. It renewed my commitment to living as clutter free as possible.  Kelly came and picked us up just as a thunderstorm began. It had taken so long to get through Tacky Palace, and with the rain, we decided to let a drive by of Taliesin and the other F. L. Wright sites to suffice. We saw Hillside, Midway farm, Taliesin and the top of Romeo & Juliet, and the Unity Chapel. Really, they are more beautiful that any photos can caputre. Somehow, the harmonic essence - the way each building fits into and interacts with its surroundings - elude photography. There is a sense of spiritual rightness when you see them in person. I wish we could have spent more time.  Kelly stopped by the office supply store on main street so that I could get some more paper, and then she dropped us off at Rumbleseats, an old-fashioned drive-in restaurant that has expanded to include some indoor seating. It used to be an A&W, but the franchise owner decorated the place with fifties memorabelia, from rock and roll and movies, and A&W wanted him to take it down and make it look like all the other franchises. So he went independent. Good thing! We had home brewed root beer (maple-y), chili corn-dogs and fries, and played with some of the games lying about. John is quite a talented etch-a-sketcher!  We walked back to Hill Street in the rain - the only person to stop and offer a ride only had one free seat. He was an old, scruffy man with a long white beard - and his car was full of fishing gear. I suppose he was only asking if I wanted a ride, not John. He seemed confused when I said, "But there's not room for both of us." He drove on. Quite interesting, that the people who have enough to be generous, never think of it, and the people who think of it, don't have enough. I want to try and pay attention - to give what I have, but how do you know when you're being oblivious?  We hung out at Hill Street until it was time to leave for dinner and the theater. We talked to Mary-Kay and John. The B&B is full tonight, all people going to the theater. Mary Kay and John are from California, they say. But they both grew up in the midwest, then lived in CA for a few years, are both psychologists, got married. When they had their son, they decided they didn't want to raise him in Sacramento, so they moved to Wisconsin. Their kid is nine years old, is a vegetarian because mom says so, (he gets to choose for himself when he's twelve). We talked about child-rearing techniques. I liked them. They're funny, intellectual, self-conscious sorts - too aware to see their own belly-buttons.  Kelly drove us to dinner, to a hotel she described as "right across the street" from the outdoor theater. We already knew that the theater itself was a long walk from the road into the woods. We didn't know that the restaurant was a long drive over a hilly, winding, shoulderless, side-walk-less driveway from the road. So it would really be impossible to walk - too far, and we'd be taken out by a BMW coming around one of those curves. Kelly almost clobbered a fawn and mother deer coming around a corner. So we bet on a shuttle-bus, since EVERYBODY goes to the theater. We had a delicious dinner with a lovely view of the wooded golf course in a "Frank Lloyd Wright inspired dining room." Quite funny. I had steak on a bed of mushroom wine sauce, the baby carrots and zuchinis were superb. Then we asked at the front desk when the shuttle would be going to the theater. The receptionist said there wasn't one. So everyone at this couple-hundred room hotel drove separate cars across the street to the theater. Amazing. As we stood there explaining that we are biking across country, do not have a car, and do not wish to inconvenience our hosts by having them drive all the way back down here to carry us to the theater, and we do not wish to get squashed by the flood of traffic, and couldn't they help us in some way, a woman carrying a large box to her car came to our rescue. She offered us a ride because she was on her way over there now. After we chased a feral cat out of the trash can by the front door (oh, the strangeness) we piled in her comfy, smelly old hatch-back. Let the golfers keep their luxury sedans, we met a wonderful new friend. It turns out that she and her husband are avid bikers and we talked bike-adventure all the way to the theater.  The setting is beautiful - very like the Carter Barron back home. Wooded, with picnic tables tucked into glens and grassy nooks along the path. Live, traditional musicians wandered and played. The theater itself is also open air, but unlike Carter Barron, the seats are quite comfortable, upholstered cushions in a weatherproof material. We had excellent second row seats. As we waited for the show to begin, the rain, which has dogged us all day, returned once again. The theater was quite full in spite of the drenching, steady downpour, and the mood was lively and adventurous, so we waited and chatted with our neighbors. Then a man with a megaphone came down to announce that the start of the play would be delayed, in hopes that the weather would let up. So we got wetter and wetter, and waited. Finally, he reappeared and announced that the weather service was not calling for any break in the storm, so they were officially canceling the performance (something everyone had sworn to us never happens). So everyone would get their money back. However, for those of us who wished to remain, they would attempt to go on with the show. Cheers erupted from the soggy crowd. No one left. Out came the stage crew, to comically sweep the rain off the stage, and to wipe off the chairs with dripping towels. Rain or no rain, they do their jobs! The show began - a french comedy of errors, twins mistaken for each other. The acting was good, despite the soaking costumes, and the play seemed like it would be a pleasant one. But then the sky turned green. That dark, sickly color that makes you say, "Uh oh." And the wind - the wind began to compete with the performers, throwing their voices back at them. The lead actor, now as the saucy twin, pointed and said, "There's a man..." and sure enough, the man with the megaphone returned to call off the performance for good. Scenery took flight. Potted plants left there pots altogether. The pots rolled across the stage, and the greenery flew through the air. The french doors flapped and banged like a clapping toy. The actors ran gratefully for cover and a mass exodus rumbled down through the woods to the parking lot. We called Jay and Kelly, who came to get us. Oh, the adventure of outdoor theater! Someday we'll have to return and actually see a play. But I don't think we will ever forget this day! After hanging everything up to dry and eating some cookies for solace, we went to bed, at the end of a strange and exciting day.
Lovely breakfast, again. Baked, stuffed french toast and bacon, cappuchino muffins, almond danishes. Kelly used to work in a bakery. This morning, we sat with a couple from a Del Webb community in Chicago. (Grandpa and Hope live in a Del Webb community in Phoenix.) They come up every summer for the outdoor theater (By the way, the place is called the American Players Theater.) Also, two women from Milwaukee shared our table. Everyone mostly asked about our trip, so we didn't learn much about them. After breakfast we sat in the living room and gabbed with a family of four - we were reluctant to get on the road because (surprise, surprise) it was raining. So they talked about kids and grand-kids and computers.  Finally we loaded our stuff into Kelly's CRV. Hooray! She'll drop it off at the Lamb's Inn in Richland Center for us. Then off we went, heading north west through a wide valley. The rain and dark clouds were gone - instead we had blue sky, flat road, and a 10-20 mph west wind chasing puffy clouds over our heads. The valley is so lovely - the hills and farms and woods - the cloud shadows playing over the variant greens of the land. Lovely! We had lunch at the Wings Cafe, at the tiny airport. I asked for cocktail sauce to go with the fried clams - and she thought I said TACO sauce - which wasn't bad. But then when she did bring the cocktail, she'd mixed up a huge bowlful! Back on the road, we passed the Sprecher's Farm - we were told that they have lots of kids, more than they can handle or afford. Seems they're "talked about" in these parts. Their barn said "Lactoland Dairy Farm" Literal folks.  We kept fighting that headwind, and then began climbing out of the valley. I knew it was too good to last. Oh, what hills these are! We climbed some real doozies, but still, I think it was the wind that made them seem so bad. Tomorrow, we're heading north-east, so then this wind will be behind us. That ride will be VERY hilly. We arrived at the Lamb's Inn, four miles outside of Richland Center, on the last scrap of our strength. And I had to go to the bathroom. We were greeted by a fat, friendly old dog, part shepherd, part black lab. Her name is Holly. Donna pulled up soon to invite us in and show us around. She let me use the bathroom and helped take our stuff to the cottage. The decor is all 80's K-Mart country, but it is clean and spacious - we've got a whole apartment with a loft to ourselves. I have to say having a kitchen made me giddy. I played with the refrigerator door and the pot scrubber. Wheee. I think it just feels more like "HOME" with a kitchen to ourselves. Psychology is so weird.  We came over and met Jim & Deena - we were told back in Spring Green that this couple from Minneapolis was anxious to meet us. So here they were - power-bike people in their early fifties, newly retired from biotech and management at Pillsbury, biking all over the planet. They don't do any loaded, long-distance riding like we are, but they just got back from New Zealand (we were there in April) where they biked up 3,000 foot passes over which we rode buses. They're insane. But they're also extremely kind and fascinating - we had lots of fun spending the evening with them. We loaded into their SUV and drove for an hour to a dingy bar for the fish fry. They have two grown daughters, and are soon to go biking in Italy. They've bought some land down in the Spring Green area and hope to build their retirement home there, in Frank Lloyd Wright style, if they can get the snooty architects at Taliesin to cooperate. They told us about the things they did at Pillsbury. They worked on the toaster bagels! Wow! They made us eat cheese curds, and just folded us into their lives. They'll be out of town when we get to Minneapolis, but they gave us their number anyway and told us all the best places to eat. We had a wonderful evening - the adventure continues! Never know who you'll meet, what you'll do, or what weird things you'll learn.
We gabbed until after 11 a.m. - we sure get late starts from the B&B's. But the conversation is worth it. Donna took our stuff and will drop it off in Reedsburg. This is our last day of gear-less riding, until the end of the trip. So sad! The first 10 miles were quite speedy - there was a gentle tailwind (I want to know what happened to the 20 mph-er!) and it was mostly flat or gently down-hill. We passed other bikers and said hello. The weather is so gorgeous today, and it's a Saturday in June. We went through a few unincorporated towns and lots of farmland. Then we began to climb. For about four miles, we netted quite an increase in altitude, over many ups and downs. It seemed like every time we had to struggle up a hill, dogs came out to chase us. At one place, with motorcycles out front and hog flags flying from the porch, a pair of baying beagles came out after us. The leather-clad owner called lazily to the dogs, "Harley, Davidson, get back here." He must be a nice owner. They didn't pay any attention to him. We had to hoof it a few times. When we reached the town of Lime Ridge near the top, we stopped for lunch at a bar called Wounded Knee decorated in tacky cowboy and indian decor. Burgers and tater tots were pretty good.  Then we were 11 miles from Reedsburg. We climbed more gentle slopes, still going up for another 6 miles, to the height of all heights. On the broad, flat top, the world stretched away beneath our feet in all directions, on into hazy distances miles away. I felt like I could see Lake Michigan and the Mississippi. (I couldn't. It wasn't that high.) And of course, you know what this means - we still had five miles to Reedsburg, and it's all downhill! That was the funnest five miles on the whole trip, I think. We went so fast, we rattled our teeth and shouted Whee! We sailed, we flew! Up and down hills, all the way down to the Baraboo River and into town. I don't think we had to pedal up one single hill, we just sailed right over them with so much momentum.    We checked into the Parkview B&B - then went to the movies on main street and saw Atlantis. It was okay, but I miss the music. There were no sing-along-songs! There was a problem with the sound part way through the film, so they gave everyone free tickets to any other show. We went back to the B&B, got cleaned up, went to dinner at the Chinese Buffet, then went to see Tomb Raider for free. Brainless fun! Double feature!
Today we biked the 400 Trail, named for the Minneapolis to Chicago train that ran in 400 minutes. We had breakfast with the other guests at the Parkview - strawberry french toast and sausage, then packed our bikes and hit the trail. No more road biking for us for a while! The trail is flat as a pancake, crushed limestone, and is sheltered from the wind by scrubby woods. Quite a change from the wide-open hilly roads we've been on lately. It's a beautiful day, but hot and the bugs are bad. The trail goes through swampy woods and stream valleys lines with rock outcroppings - interesting to look at. Spotted lots of birds - yesterday I forgot to mention we saw a hawk turning lazy circles, riding thermals in the sky. It was piercing the air with it's scream - quite an awesome sound that I'd never heard in real life before. We passed a few other bikers, but not many. And the towns through which we passed were really dead. I don't see how they make it in business if everything closes on Sundays. Seems that if your main industry is supporting the travellers on a recreational trail, you should be open on the weekends. Oh well. We had lunch in Wonawoc at yet another dingy, dark bar. I had a french dip that the waitress didn't think I could eat. HAH! John had the ubiquitous burger. Then we biked on through the town of Elroy. That's the end of the 400 Trail and the beginning of the Elroy-Sparta Trail, the first Rail-to-Trail in the U.S., opened in 1965. They have a lovely trail center in a restored train station - with showers and camp sites and a shop. But as far as we could tell there wasn't any bed and breakfast to stay at, so we biked on. We saw more swamps and rocks. After seven miles we stopped in Kendall. There is a brand new motel right on the trail, and I had reached that level of exhaustion and soreness - the bikitis. We had to check in for the Country Livin' Motel down at the filling station, then got into our room. It's big and clean and quiet. We walked to dinner at the local (can you guess) dingy dark bar, this one claiming to be a restaurant, and seemingly the only place in town that will be open for breakfast in the morning. Oh, joy. Actually, they even sport a salad bar in one dark corner.  Back in the room, we each called our Dads ( it is Father's Day today) and watched a sappy movie on TCM. Too achy and tired to write any more - Good night!

The tunnels are so dark and long that we had to walk our bikes - even with our bike lights and flashlights, we could barely see our front tires. We walked single file and stayed as close to the center of the trail as possible. The tunnels were hewn by hand out of the rock - the oldest was not even lined, as the others were, with bricks. The tunnel entrances have looming wooden doors that evoke medieval castles and dungeons. They're used to seal the tunnels in winter, so that the water inside - from live springs in the rocks above them - does not freeze and cause the tunnel to crack and collapse. The water from the springs drips constantly inside, giving off eerie echoes. From the two shorter tunnels, one end or the other of the tunnel is visible at all times, but in the longest, there is a god portion in the center where no light from either end penetrates.  At the entrance to the longest tunnel, we met Sawyer and his mom and dad. Sawyer's a young fellow, I think four years old, and the family had walked all the way through the tunnel without any flashlights. It had proved too long a walk for the youngster, who'd had an accident. Mom and Dad had cleaned him all up and were just waiting for him to build up the courage to return. (Yes, they had to walk all the way back through!) So we all walked together and talked the whole way, and I think Sawyer held on to the back of my bike. I think our lights were a good reassurance to him. Before we started through, he stood at the mouth of the tunnel, gazing silently into the depths, and up at the ceiling of rock. Who knows what went through his mind, but from somewhere he found the courage to make the long walk back. Brave little man! As we came along an especially quiet spot in the woods, we saw in front of us a family of racoons right on the path. We slowed and stopped, as close to them as we dared come. Still, they scattered at the sight of us, but as luck would have it, Mama and one baby went to one side of the path, and the other three babies disappeared into the trees on the other side of the path. So we held our breath and waited silently. John took out the camera. Sure enough, in a few minutes, the babies began crying to each other, and the mama even answered. Slowly, unsure of what to do, the three babies came out, wanting to run to their mother, but looking at us, they'd scurry back. Then the one baby with mama came out, and met the others halfway, arching it's back and prancing. It looked as if older sister were scolding the siblings for not following mom! They nuzzled each other and chittered and rolled around, and finally the one led the other three across and into the trees. Mama never showed herself, but as we biked by, we saw the babies in the trees, peering at us curiously.  We had lunch at Diamond L'il's, a dark dingy bar with a western gold-rush theme. Lots of locals hanging out. This town is the Black Squirrel Capital of the U.S. Didn't see any, but they seem proud anyway.  We got into Sparta in the afternoon, and discovered that the trail actually ends two miles out of town. As we got to town, we stopped at Speed's Bike Shop and were harrassed by an eight year old boy, apparently the owner's son. He asked us bruskly about our trip and our bikes and gear. He told us about his dream-bike, and stunt or trick bike. Then as we left, he shouted, "Hey, you forgot your special surprise!" And shot us with rubber bands. What fun. Sparta claims to be the Bike Capital of the U.S., but we were frustrated by the lack of bike lanes on the roads, the lack of bike racks anywhere, and the difficulty in getting around by bike in the town. All we can figure is they're the capital because they have a really big statue of a guy riding a penny-farthing called "Ben Biking." Back at the end of the trail, a bulletin board had listed the location of the Strawberry Lace Inn bed and breakfast, which was also advertised on our map of the bike trail. So we called, and they said they had a room available. But when we arrived, tired, sore, dirty, and in dire need of a bathroom, Elsie, the owner, was squeamish about letting us in - she didn't want to let us through her door in the back, but also didn't want us stepping on her rugs. I understand the value of fine decor, but if you've got that kind of stuff, then you really shouldn't advertise on a hiker/biker trail - there's nowhere for people to get cleaned up before arriving! She actually expected us to hose ourselves off in the driveway before entering the house. I don't think my bladder could have survived a cold hose shower after biking all day. But other than that, Elsie and her husband Jack were extremely hospitable (especially once we were all clean) and the house is sumptuous - their attention to detail, luxury, and historic restoration is meticulous. We biked to down town to do our laundry at the coin-op, and then had pretty good Chinese food on Main Street. Then we went to the library for some email time before turning in.
Today we biked the LaCrosse River Trail that parallels the river over the Mississippi bluffs, and to the Mississippi itself. When we began, a huge group of children on bikes clogged the path - it seemed to be a summer camp, manned by too few adults. The kids were all over the place. We passed them slowly, ringing our bells and asking them to stay to the right, but none of them seemed to have any idea which way was right, let alone any kind of bike trail etiquette. They crowded in front of us so we couldn't pass, or tried to race us when we did pass, swerved suddenly towards us - it was frustrating and scary. I was sure we were going to hit one of them. When we got to the front, I told the man in front that he needed to teach the kids to stay to the right on the trail. He apologized. I know I was being a grump, but I don't care, they were annoying. But we got passed them finally and had the wide open trail all to ourselves for many miles. We stopped for a snack in Bangor, WI, at a very fun old fashioned soda shop called Main Street Cafe. Their hot dogs are delicious. It's cooler today, very clear sky, lovely. And not so many bugs!  When we got to LaCrosse and Onalaska, the trail goes through a few confusing turns and down an alley behind dirty buildings, and then becomes a good bike trail again on the banks of the Mississippi. Wonderful! We stood and soaked up the view. This felt like quite an achievement to us, to have reached the great river.  We planned on stopping at a bed and breakfast in town that looked like it was right on the trail. The place is a famous restored lumber baron mansion, and sounded quite fun. Jim and Deena Behnke had recommended it highly, and the restaurant in the place as well. So we biked along, really looking forward to a place with character and great food. We biked and biked and biked. To our left, the land dropped steeply to the river. To the right, it rose up through dense woods to the road and town. The map had made it seem like we could reach the B&B from the trail, so we kept going. When we reached a place where a narrow path switchbacked sharply up to the road, we got off the trail and headed up. We discovered that we'd biked right on through the entire town, missing the B&B and everything. The only thing to do was to bike back - but we'd come up hill for quite a few miles, and I couldn't stand the thought of losing all that ground. In a mile, we came to the Shadow Run Lodge, an icky roadside motel. We had planned on staying in Onalaska for a day, so that we could take a cruise on the Mississippi. But this place was so yucky, that we found a dinner cruise on the river for tonight, and we'll head on out tomorrow.  We walked to the quickie mart for a late lunch, and met a woman selling mints for the Lion's Club. She lives north of here, right on the trail we'll bike tomorrow, so we told her we'd wave if we saw her. On the walk back to the motel, I saw a man mowing his lawn, which had a sign in it, advertising Avon's Skin-So-Soft. We're almost out of the bug-repellant sunscreen, so we asked him about it. He invited us in and explained that his wife sells the Avon, but that she's out. He called her on the cell phone, and she talked him through finding the stuff. We paid him, and told him to keep the change, but he insisted on giving us four dollars in quarters. He didn't understand that we didn't want the extra weight! But I guess we can save them for the next laundry day.  The dinner cruise was lovely - the boat a bit tacky, full of retired people getting sloshed, but the views were what we came for, and we were rewarded. We saw the sun set on the river, spotted a few heron, and the towns on the banks were lovely, sparkling lights in the darkness. We passed a few paddle wheelers, and went under some interesting bridges. Some of the other passengers are on their way to an Airstream Convention in South Dakota. I told them that my bike was an airstream - perhaps I could trade it in on a motor home. They got a big kick out of that and had to tell everyone about the girl with the airstream bike.  The taxi took us back to the Shadow Run, and we called it a day - not what we expected, but not bad overall. Tomorrow should be our last day in Wisconsin!
The trail ends at Route 35, and from there we biked five miles to route 54, which took us over the bridge into Winona, Minnesota. The bridge was high and heavily trafficked and scary, with very little shoulder. But the view was gorgeous when I got up the nerve to look! John tried to stop and take a photo from the top of the bridge, but I freaked out - I'm a bridge-a-phobe. We saw an AmericInn on our way over, so we went there and got a room. Then we biked into town, ate at Hardee's, found a bike shop to get John new gloves, and while we were there, I insisted on checking John's spokes. BROKEN! They fixed it for us in no time. Then we found a book store, and John picked out some new reading material. After a bath and nap, we got a taxi to the "mall." The cab driver is a local guy - he's grown up here in Winona, and lives on a houseboat with no power, no phone, no water. He even invited us over to it - if we hadn't been so lethargic, it would have been fun. He was quite a cool dude! The "mall" in Winona is really dinky - no department stores. But there was a one hour photo shop, so we dropped off two rolls of film. There was a cuban restaurant that turned out to be pretty good. We got some toothpaste and such at the grocery store. Also, I looked at bathing suits at the tanning salon, because I left mine in Madison (Sad - I loved that suit!) But they were expensive and not very well made.  After we got our pictures, we called the cool dude to come and get us, and we headed back to the hotel. We watched some Star Trek before bed - always a treat!
We got back on the road and fought through the wind - knowing that at the end of the day we'd get some kitty time! Wabasha, MN, home of the film Grumpy Old Men, is also the location of Anderson House, an inn that lets you take a cat to your room with you if you want. We've got two nights booked. So we joked about splitting up the petting time, and decided that whoever got to the hotel first got first dibs on the cat. We passed a huge toy factory that had school tours going on, and minigolf out front. But the sky looked ominous, and we were so exhausted and ready to collapse, that we pushed on. Nowhere to hide, no way to speed up, racing to town with our last rags of energy, the wind picked up and the rain came down. A stinging, drenching rain drove into our faces for half an hour. It ended as quickly as it had begun, and the breaking sun lifted a steamy mist off of the road surface. The passing trucks sprayed us pretty well, but we appreciated the piggy-back on their air stream. We got to Wabasha and I pedaled like a maniac. I got to the Anderson well ahead of John, at least half a mile. Hah!  We checked in and got all cleaned up, and waited for our cat to be delivered. We finally decided to go ask about her. The cat lady had just arrived, and let us pick from the entire room. We went back to our room with the one that had climbed onto John's and my shoulders and wouldn't get off, kneading us with her paws. I guess with cats, they do the picking. Ginger is a super snuggly, playful, and demanding little tabby. She has claws, so the kneading gets a little painful. We played with her for a while, then went and had dinner at Slippery's, featured in the film as Chuck's Bait Shop. They really had a horrible flood in April - it destroyed their basement and all of the movie sets they'd collected.  We came back and had a nice evening resting in our quiet, dry room with our kitty. Tomorrow will be a welcome day off!
We had breakfast in the Anderson's dining room - a Pennsylvania Dutch restaurant of all things. I tried one of their famous sticky buns - it was huge! The size of a cake pan! But not outstanding in taste - a little too dry for my liking, but definitely fresh from the oven. Then John took a morning nap while I did the laundry. Of course, Ginger slept peacefully all morning. I played Ms. Pacman at the coin-op and read fashion magazines. When the laundry was done, John and I went to the book store. I enjoyed Asimov's Foundation, so I picked up his newer one, Prelude to the Foundation, because Alwood, a friend of ours, had just read it and wanted to discuss it. Also, I picked out a local book - Bogtrotter, by Dick Coffey. We had lunch at the 3 Sisters Bakery - interesting ham and dumpling soup. We went back to the inn and found that they had taken Ginger! Apparently, someone had specifically requested the little dingbat, so they got to have her. They said we could have one of the other cats. I tried to take a nap, and read the Bogtrotter book, but didn't sleep. Finally, we went to the cat room and they let us pick a cat from the three leftovers. I picked up one that was curled into a ball and sleeping peacefully (I thought perhaps she might be calmer than Ginger.) She looked like a mane coon. It purred and liked to be held and petted. It's an ugly cat, and no one knows it's name (the cat lady is gone for the day.) We decided to name her "Throw Pillow" because she took up residence in an arm chair and curled into an unmoving lump.  We had dinner at the Anderson and came back to the room to discover that the kitty had puked up a hairball on the floor, so now we're calling her "Throw Up Pillow."  Or "Ralph" for short. Just outside of our room's window, the town holds concerts under the bridge that runs over the Mississippi. Tonight it's jazz. We went and sat at the concert for a while, enjoying the music. When the mosquitoes discovered us, we went in, had some pie at the restaurant and then headed for bed.  I forgot to mention that we visited the "internet caf" in town - one computer, ice cream, coffee, and interesting sandwiches on "cro-bags" croissants baked out of bagel dough. It was yummy.  We also went back to the bookstore before it closed so I could get more books. I was almost finished with Bogtrotter, and hadn't really liked it. But it made me want to read the Little House books again. (we're biking up the Laura Ingalls Wilder Memorial Trail.) and Pilgrim at Tinker Creek, by Annie Dillard - I like her approach to the Modern Thoreau movement better than Coffey's self-aggrandizing one. The book shop owner's husband is very into biking, so we chatted, and she said I could return the Coffey book to her tomorrow a.m. at the internet caf, where she hangs out every morning before opening the book store. Cool! So that was our day off - naps and laundry, jazz, cats, books and food!
We got into Red Wing and called the Americinn - all booked. But the Best Western had a jacuzzi room available! So we went there and took a nice bath, had a healthy dinner of salads, and went back to our room to read our books in bed.
We biked to the B&B - the Rosewood, but a note said they were sorry, but were out and wouldn't be back for three hours. We were really early - hours before the check-in time. So we unloaded our stuff onto the porch and biked down to the main street, and historic riverfront of victorian buildings. We had lunch at Professor Java's - good egg salad. Then we walked along,  enjoying the view of the Mississippi for a while. It's much narrower with steeper banks here. The bridge used to be an interesting spiral design that deposited people closer to the commercial district on the waterfront. After killing time, we went back to the inn and the housekeeper took pity on us and let us in. We looked all around - since we're early the place is empty, so I checked out all the other rooms. This place is amazing! Every room has a fireplace and hot tub, but is carefully designed to be romantic and old-fashioned. They make sure that you can see the fireplace from each tub - maximum atmosphere! I highly recommend it as a romantic retreat. They even have special packages that include gourmet dinners and breakfasts in your room! But then I laid down and couldn't get back up. Had some very sick feeling moments. Hope this bug leaves soon!

But we made it to the beltway surrounding the twin cities (Minneapolis and St, Paul) and found a hotel. From there, we called Enterprise rent-a-car and got a car - then we drove into the city to take a look. Since we'd never found any information about bike routes around the cities, we chickened out. We saw the skylines, and drove around the lakes west of Minneapolis' down town - very beautiful. We found a Somali restaurant on Nicollet Street - it was okay, but not air conditioned. Did I mention it's SO HOT?! After dinner, on our way back to the hotel, we decided to go to the mall. I'm sorry, which mall do you ask?  THE MALL. THE MALL OF AMERICA. A better symbol of American culture than all of the Smithsonian and Mount Rushmore combined. THE mall. I left my bathing suit in Madison, and THE MALL has a Nordstrom's , that usually has good suits on sale. So in we went. I did find a nice suit - and then we tottered on the brink - did we escape with our dignity and head straight for the car, or succumb to the shrine of indecent consumption and go INTO the mall? We gave in. Hey, everybody else was doing it. It is huge - four stories of shops - but in some ways indistinguishable from every other mall in the country. All the same stores. Except that it just happens to have EVERY store that there is in the one place. Then when you get to the center, the size becomes fathomable - an entire amusement park sits inside the mall - roller coaster, ferris wheel, merry go round, and many other rides. We found a book store and bought some more books, bought a funnel cake in the amusement park and marvelled at the grand excesses. We even had fun looking at the Lego store. Wheee!  So that was our last day of biking. We halt our westward journey in the midwesternest city  of them all - we biked to the heart of the land and saw what there was to see.
First of all - it took more than two hours to drive there. We're farther than I thought. Second of all - there were many volunteers, and while I thought they were doing an amazing job of keeping everything organized under the circumstances, our group slipped through the cracks and we were dropped off at the wrong sites three times. We tried to make ourselves useful, but there really wasn't much for us to do until we were bussed to the right place and given instructions. So it took us over four hours to finally get to where we were helping. On our bus, there were people from all walks of life - couples from the city taking off work, construction workers, local men from nearby towns, mothers with kids off from school for the summer, even a group of boy scouts from Texas and their den mother. One woman was quite obnoxious at our first stop. We were dropped off in the wreckage of a road of houses - it was a huge mess. People were carrying things in all directions, and heavy equipment was moving around. After a few attempts at trying to find someone to tell us what to do, the woman took charge and started ordering everyone to clean up everything from this one yard. We did so for a while, but then it seemed clear to me that we weren't helping - the stuff had to be sorted and it wasn't clear where the stuff was supposed to go. I decided not to waste my energy, and wait until I knew I'd be doing some good. Anyway, it was lunch time. So I and a number of other stood around eating our lunch and waiting for instructions. But the bossy lady made sarcastic comments to us about not having willing attitudes. Whatever.  After the second drop off in the wrong place, the volunteer coordinator was apologetic, and said whoever wanted to quit then could stay on the bus and be taken back to the parking lot, but whoever was still up to working, could really be used in this farmer's field. All of us stayed to help clean up except the obnoxious lady! I guess she only has a willing attitude if she's in charge!  The damage was amazing - this old couple's life-long home had been shattered into tiny bits, blown completely off it's foundation, and scattered all over their hay fields. Meanwhile, they'd hidden in the basement. Amazing. It was good to meet them and let them know that they aren't alone. While we combed through the hay picking up the bits and pieces, a construction crew was well on the way to raising them a new house. In the basement with them they had had the original house-plans, so they were having it restored. When we told him we were from Washington D.C., he said, "Oh, you live there with my good friend George W." We let politics lie and got to work.  It was hot, and felt somewhat futile. The farmer couldn't harvest his hay if it had all this debris in it - it'd break the machine down. But no matter how carefully we looked, it seemed like the bits and pieces were unending. There were little knick knacks. Small parts off of furniture. Torn and dirty clothing. Sections of window-frame still holding jagged teeth of glass. Far back in the field was a dead deer, the farmer's wife had told us to steer clear of it - we'd know when we were close by the smell. It was hot. The debris was heavy. We didn't finish the field - not by far - but after two hours, the pile had grown, and the work was closer to finished. More volunteers would return in the following days, hopefully cleaning it up enough to salvage the crop. After that we were so exhausted and dirty, we drove back to the hotel and collapsed. I don't think we'll be going back. I'm glad we pitched in, but they really seem to have plenty of willing volunteers, and are well on their way to recovery. It struck me that even in the face of such devastation, in some ways the wealth and prosperity of this country shelters us. Two people were killed, and of course no insurance policy can make up for that, but everything else was covered - businesses, homes, farms, everything would be replaced or rebuilt within a few months. It felt to me like I was looking at the height of the nation's self-sufficiency - we have so much that even in such a case of loss, our excess makes up for it almost immediately. It felt like Americans can't really know what poverty is - in the way it is experienced in other parts of the world. Our possessions shelter us from suffering, but they also shelter us from need. And that may seem like a good thing, but I think something is also lost. By never needing, we never experience grace and mercy. It was a blessing to me to be able to reach out my hands and meet the needs of someone - there was a connection - however small in this land of plenty - between us - the volunteers, and victims - that taught us all about goodness and mercy. We have so few opportunities in this country to learn it.
I also went to a craft store and got some quilting scraps and scissors and thread and stuff. I started making a little quilted square - a picture of a lighthouse. It's a lot harder than I thought it would be - I don't know how to sew two pieces together in a curve. But I think it looks cool so far. I like the fabrics I chose - they're all textured and patterned, and give the impression of different shades of color. So that's all for today - a very quiet day after the physical and emotional rigors of Siren. Interesting, that I respond to devastation by needing to shop.
They got a room at the hotel, to rest for the night, then the plan is to drive up to Lake Superior tomorrow. We went to the little town of Stillwater, back on the La Croix river on the border of Wisconsin and Minnesota. We'd been told that the town has the best German restaurant in the area. It definitely was authentic! It was just like we remembered from Berlin. The roasted pork, wursts, and schnitzel were all delicious, and the Hungarian goulasch was pretty close. Also, they made us spatzie, the mix of orange soda and cola that we used to get in the "Old Country."
We drove north for several hours, and arrived in Duluth in the evening, cramped and tired. Duluth is situated on a steep hill that falls directly into the lake. It's along the Minnesota side of an inlet to the Lake, and its shore is lined with industrial docks and warehouses - this is a major port for the shipping of resources from the breadbasket of the Midwest to the population centers of the east coast. Huge ships, specially designed to carry monstrous loads of cargo on the Great Lakes still pull in and out of the inlet.  We checked into the Hawthorne Suites, housed inside a converted tool factory from the turn of the last century. We ate at the steak house on the first floor, then turned in early. The rooms we got were on the "inside" the middle of the building with no windows out. But the huge sections of pillar that rose through the rooms, and the brick work were all unique. There's a pool and a hot tub, so we did get some soaking time before bed. Another day of bike-free luxury for me!
The weather is so much nicer up here - in Minneapolis, it was sweltering. But just this much farther north, it is so much cooler. We took a drive through Duluth looking at the neighborhoods, and spying Lake Superior from time to time. We walked down Main Street, which lines the road leading to the bridge over the inlet on the other side of which is Superior, Wisconsin. (what a mouthful!) We had lunch at Willy's Filling Station - cute '50's automobile dcor and really great hot dogs and fries. Love their red relish! Of course, we had to visit the Army Corps of Engineers museum. Dad's an electrical engineer, John's degree is in mechanical engineer, and John's dad works for the Corps as a civil engineer. Mom and I survived. Actually, I liked learning about all of the different things they ship through here - grain, iron ore, oil - and there was a relief map of the lakes, showing the depths of the bottom - I found that fascinating. Hills and mountains all underwater. Also, while we stood outside waiting forever for the guys to get done, we saw a seagull gulp down in one bite an entire scoop of ice cream. Talk about the worst brain freeze ever! He had dinner at Tavern on the Lake, done up in an English Pub style, with excellent yuppy sandwiches. We finished the day by going to see the film, A.I.  Can't say I loved it, but it was good, and thought provoking, so worth seeing. Made us all think about the responsibility we have to what we create - and it's not so unbelievable - computers are getting pretty "smart" these days, and yet we still think of them as toasters, not beings. Dad wouldn't talk for a long time after seeing it. He thinks a lot about artificial intelligence, and I think it really disturbed him - perhaps he just can't fathom the possibility that people could be so cruel. I had a hard time believing any sane woman would just dump the kid in the woods, but other than that, I could believe that a mob of fanatics would be like that. Anyway, it did make us all think. Tomorrow, it's back on the bikes - Dad will join John and me while Mom drives the car with all our stuff to Iron River, Wisconsin. Oh, the joys of a sag wagon!
We checked out of the hotel in Duluth and rode in the car over to Superior, where a trail runs east through northern Wisconsin. But south of town the trail turns into gravel - that was really slowing us down, and dad's got a road bike, not a hybrid, and no spare inner tubes. So we took to the road. Big, big, BIG hills. Amazing roller coaster, out of nowhere hills. And fast cars nearly taking us off the road - kind of scary. And no rest stops - snacks or BATHROOMS. I enjoyed it for the first 15 miles. A fifteen mile bike ride is quite nice. Especially with no extra weight on the bike (besides me), and the views were spectacular - of the land, not what was on it. Pretty boring farmish - but the hills and sky were lovely. We stopped at a 1950's school building - a guy had bought it and renovated the interior, and was having a yard sale of all the old junk from the school - desks and books and stuff. He didn't know what he was going to use the building for, but it sure was cool.  After 25 miles, I had to go to the bathroom so bad. Even though we were biking through nothing-ness, I never really saw a place that I was comfortable going by the side of the road. Just enough cars came by, and it was farm after farm, no good trees or anything. So I called Mom on the wonderful cell phone!  Dad & John took off and I waited. Mom drove along and found me by the side of the road. Oh, a gas station has never looked so good! We drove on to Iron River, and just as we got our lunch at the A&W drive-in, Dad biked up. I got annoyed, because when John left me, I got the impression that he could still see Dad from the top of the hill. But Dad said he hadn't ever seen John, and didn't know I'd bagged out - so John was tootling along all alone, no phone or anything. He could get run over by a truck and no one would know. I guess I'm anal - but I think that bikers should stick together, especially if they have no phone. Dad shouldn't have gotten so far ahead that he lost track of John and me. I didn't mean to seem annoyed, but I guess Dad picked up on it, so he biked back to make sure John saw where to turn.  Anyway, it all worked out fine, we all had lunch, then headed for the Trout Haus B&B. It's a comfy, homey, woodsy place - just like staying with friends. They keep trout ponds going, and raise Rainbow trout. A toddler came and caught two fish (with lots of help from his grandpa).  For dinner, we drove to a place called "The Spot," a caf on one of the lakes around here that are rimmed with vacation cabins - it's been a hot spot for this kind of hunting-fishing tourism for a very long time. So the place is rustic and rural, and packed. We had a fine dinner, and then headed back to the Haus for bed.

After the laundry, Mom and I visited JavaTrout, the coffee shop in town also run by the B&B owners. They had a computer there, so I emailed everyone to let them know when we'd be back in Maryland - only four more days! Mom sampled flavored sodas and microbrews while I typed. We had lunch at the A&W before hitting the road.  I decided against biking partly because the weather is cloudy and drizzly today, but also because I've missed my Mom! So we got to spend some time together (getting robbed.) We drove to Ashland in about an hour, and found that the guys had already checked into the hotel. Speedy bikers! We drove to Bee's Caf in the rain. They had excellent soups - pea or beef and potato.  After lunch we drove around town - not much to see. An old concrete dock for loading the big carriers sits moldering on the shore. Northland College was interesting - "an Environmental Liberal Arts School." I have no idea what that means. They had some unique architecture - historic brownstone combined with eco-friendly underground structures with solar paneling. We had dinner at a Victorian era hotel - I had whitefish baked on a maple plank - it was perfectly done, delicious!
It turned out so much better than we could have imagined. First of all, the town, population 686,  is situated on the side of the red clay hills, right down to the shore. It has been a commercial fishing town for a long time, and is closely linked to the Chippewa people living just to the north on the Redcliff Reservation. Earlier this century, mudslides wiped out the entire waterfront. So the only Victorian architecture still standing is inland, uphill. That's where all the written up B&B's are, nowhere near the water. The Bayfront, though, is newly built, right in the center of the new waterfront - in the district of shops, restaurants, and ferry docks. So we had splendid views and were right in the heart of all the action. It's a quaint town with an eclectic population - old fishermen, Native Americans, artists of all kinds, hippy eco-campers, and yuppy tourists who bring the cash. I don't want to think about where we fit in there. Anyway, it is the perfect place to be for the Fourth - the quintessential American small town. Out on Lake Superior, we can see a few of the Apostle Islands, nearest being Madeleine Island with the town of La Pointe. Mom &  I sat on our balcony overlooking the town's park and main road, Rittenhouse. We people-watched until we saw Dad and John ride DOWN the big hill to the waterfront. What fun! We had lunch then wandered through the shops - some fitful rain-showers blew through in the afternoon. John got some much needed introvert time and holed up in our room with his book while the rest of us wandered around.  For dinner we tried Mama Get's Caf - good food and cool jazz. I had BBQ ribs that were yummy and sloppy. Everyone seemed to like their food. After dinner, I enjoyed our jacuzzi tub before bed. This really is an incredibly wonderful room. (NOTE TO PEOPLE WHO THINK I'M CRAZY FOR GOING ON THIS TRIP - just do a word search and see how many times I've gotten to relax in hot tubs. I have my priorities straight!) You bike, so that you can soak!
We ferried back over to Bayfield and had lunch at Greunke's - supposedly great, but I thought the fried trout was overcooked. I took a nap after lunch and another bath. John wrote on his palm pilot and Mom and Dad went shopping. I awoke to discover a family of fiddlers in the gazebo below our balcony playing lively bluegrass. I rounded up our troops and we sat in the gazebo and listened for a while, making requests. What a gorgeous day, in such a pleasant setting! Live music, lovely weather, friendly people - just perfect. We got boxed dinners from the caf and boarded a tour boat for a THREE HOUR TOUR of the Apostle Islands. "The weather started getting rough " No, it was quite windy and cold on the lake, but no shipwrecking. We saw three lighthouses, and watched the sun set, and listened to local lore about the area. Back on land, we lounged on the balcony as the park below us began to fill up. Despite a sprinkling rain, the full moon shone out between scudding clouds. The fireworks were wonderful - they went off in the harbor right in front of the park and our balcony. We could also see the fireworks at La Pointe, across the water. An unforgettable day - and a wonderful way to wrap up our bike adventure. Hurray!

  
We will be leaving Aberdeen, Scotland mid May to cycle across Scotland to the West Coast, through Arran to Dumphries to attend the Kirkpatrick Macmillan (designer of the FIRST bicycle, powered mechanically) Rally, then on down through the UK visiting Hoylake (to see friends and relatives), South Wales (to see friends), Hampshire (to attend school reunion) before departing from Gatwick to Linate Airport (Milan). From there we intend to cycle around/through the Dolomites fro 18 days, before returning home.

Which bike to take. Having just purchased second hand Bike Fridays, we are wondering if they (we) are up to this challenge. 
The decision is made, we are taking the Bike Fridays and have purchased the 'suitcases' to be made into trailers. The trailer kits have been purchased and due for delivery on Tuesday. This is going to be an adventure in more ways than we think. 
   Oh no, a vital part was missing, pandemonium for a few hours, all solved eventually. Then we packed our bags and set off. Today was a very short day! only 6 miles to our friends for a birthday tea and bed, before 6 weeks of camping. 

  On the road by 0730 hrs via Auchenblae, Fettercairn, then onto Edzell where we met Sandy Lindsay's sister. The sun was out and we were wearing shorts, however it soon turned colder and layers were being added. We took the lower road towards Kirriemuir and ended up climbing back to the higher road to try and identify the farm of 'Ali's brother's wife's brother - Graham'. This diversion added a few miles. We were lucky and saw Graham on the road and he invited us to have a cup of tea. They were busy putting the cows out to grass for the first time this year and the bulls were creating as they weren't going out for a couple of days. We left to continue our journey to Brewlands Bridge, where we were to stay with Douglas & Ann Macarthur, cycling friends. We arrived there at 1700 hrs in the pouring rain, to a wonderful welcome. Height climbed 975 metres 
Height climbed 1045 metres   
Height climbed 495 metres
     The next ferry was in an hour, so we had our lunch beside the sea. Eventually 2 vehicles turned up to join us in the queue. Over to Lochranza, where we shopped. Set off for Blackwaterfoot but turned back as the headwind was too much, just as the Post Bus came along. We stopped her and cadged a lift to Broddick for 1.80 each (25 miles) - a bargain. Onwards 5k to a relation of a friend for a bed tonight. Height climbed 510 metres   
Height climbed 530 metres 
Dist 16.5k   
   where we visited the Green House Caf - absolutely fantastic food.     Took the back roads to Barnsoul, making one mistake which took us over the shoulder of Skeoch past the Henry Moore Statues in Glenkiln.     On arriving at the campground, a friend offered to take us into Dumfries to buy stores - great. Stocked up for the whole weekend. Height climbed 490 metres 
  Friday - wet ride out to Clattering Shaws and return via the 'Raider's Road' 16 kilometres through the forest, a filthy wet ride, cold and gale force winds.       Glad of our caravan!  Saturday - down to Caerlaverock Castle     Sunday - Kier Mill for tea and coffee, courtesy of the local ladies (as usual) then  Thornhill and over the hill to Ae (shortest placename in the UK). The shop in Ae was closed, but we managed to stop an ice cream van and all bought one.     It was the first dry, sunny day since we left. Height climbed 2155 metres
   Feeling the hills now. Through Armathwaite, Lazonby to Salkeld Dykes where we found a delightful campground for 4.      This was the second dry day of the whole trip so far.  Spent the whole day checking our computers against milestones, until we think they are fairly accurate now. Height climbed 710 metres 
  Really struggled today, looking forward to our day off in West Kirby. Over Grange Scar and down to Orton. To Tebay then over Borrowbridge before dropping down again to Killington. Took a wee lane with grass in the middle and had lunch in a field where we met an 80 yr old farmer, who was away to spray the nettles. He was fascinated with Roger's leg and our adventure. Onwards down the lane with more grass than tarmac!     To Kirby Lonsdale, then off for the last 15k, which turned out to be 20k as we got lost! Arrived at the site at 1900 hrs. This was a really hard day. Height climbed 1015 metres 
  Retraced steps to take the Quernmore Road  to by pass Lancaster. Then the A6 to Garstang (only option to take this busy road). Onwards to Preston on the A6, where we visited Brucianni's - a wonderful Italian caf, with tables and chairs on the pavement. Main roads a lot today as we took the A582 southwards. Got lost around Mawdesley, before eventually arriving at Ormskirk Rail Station where there was a train at the platform. Bought tickets for 3.20 each (really cheap for a 1 hour journey!). Changed trains in Liverpool - 2 long escalators to negotiate, before arriving at Ali's friend - Jane, who is putting us up for 3 nights. Washed our clothes in her machine - now we smell quite nice again. Out for a meal at a local Bistro before dropping into bed exhausted Height climbed 435 metres 
  
   Lovely little lanes became quite confusing when following a road atlas instead of Ordnance Survey maps.     Wonderful campground on the edge of the city at Coton Hill Farm. Shared the pitch with a turkey and his wife for 2 each and six lovely scones freshly baked by the farmer's wife. Height climbed 465 metres 
Height climbed 910 metres
Wonderful seeing Don & Peggy again and meeting their family. We camped in their garden and were fed like lords. Height climbed 1010 metres
   We talked for ages and he advised us to go on the Aven & Kennet canal towpath,    which we did for 20 flat miles right to the campground at Seend, just West of Devizes. 5.50 each! but wonderfully luxurious facilities. Our bikes are now so dusty. Height climbed 295 metres 
   The plain is not flat as we went through places like Lower Upover, Andover, where we had coffee and scones at the Coper Kettle and got charged 4.80!! We were a bit shocked. We will never enter a Copper Kettle again, as we've previously had a worse experience in one at Kirby Lonsdale last year. Arrived at Petersfield at Roger's parents, eating, resting, washing etc.. Height climbed 840 metres 
Our friends Dorothy & Douglas in Netherley went to our house, found the spares and sent them down Business Post. Many many thanks.  Also, sourced one from the manufacturer to be sent direct. Had a great evening with Lynda (Rog's sister) and Richard eating out in the garden and consuming quantities of wine and Port! Friday 6th - The spares from D&D arrived at 11:00 hrs. Relief as Rog was able to walk again. Saturday 7th - School reunion at Churchers College, where Rog went to school back in the 1960's! Sunday 8th - Off to Milan from Gatwick via Easy Jet.
Arrived Milan airport and travelled by bus and train to Bergamo YH. The trailer cases, packed with bikes and accessories were difficult to lug up and down stairs. Rog was dripping by the time we arrived! Booked a family room at the Youth Hostel - 6 beds but what the heck it was lovely, had our own private balcony, where Rog made up the bikes.  Booked a carry out pizza and beer for tea. Of course, we have arrived when there is a heatwave on - whew!!
Went in search of camping gas (as we can't carry on the plane) and tourist info.  Moved on towards Lake Iseo in the hope that we will be lucky with the gas, or it's cold tea tonight. We stopped at a wee ironmonger's and he had 'Welding Gas' which looked to be the right percentages of Propane/Butane so we bought 2 cylinders. Arrived at Clusane on Lake Iseo, our first taste of Italian campsites not too favourable - 20 square feet of hard packed sand, crammed in amongst hundreds of caravans.     Plus they charge by person and pitch here, it cost us Euro 18 (12). We are now cooking, in more ways than one. On arrival, Rog surrendered Ali's passport as they expect you to pay in the mornings. Height climbed 165 metres 
They weren't worried, they had Ali's passport! Ali wonders if I meant to dump her and had 2nd thoughts! Rather than ride up the lake side through many tunnels,     we caught a ferry to Pisogne. We had our lunch of bread, cheese, tomatoes and fruit on board.     We booked in to Campground Eden on arrival and purchased some food for supper at this rather luxurious hypermarket. Pisogne is surrounded by mountains reaching up to the sky - we wonder which ones we can cycle up. This site is Euro 16.10 (11) and much nicer. We have decided to stay here a while as the heat is just too much to lug our baggage around with us. There are enough options to keep us going for days, if not the whole period. Height climbed 70 metres The site is at 190 metres - now remember that as all our adventures will advise you the height we climb to!! 
We set off for Fraine above Pisogne and thought that we may also go to Grignaghe.  The road climbed steadily all the way to Fraine (825m) were we stopped at a cafe for coffee and fizzy water. Onwards to have our lunch of bread and fruit in a field beside a house.  Ever onwards to a 'ski area' where we paddled our feet in a lovely cooling stream. We kept passing be locals making hay on the steep slopes (the whole families were out working) and they could only use scythes and rakes - no mechanisation here!    We were advised that a side road went around the mountain to Grignaghe, so off we set - guess what - we climbed again. This time to 1295m.  Wow what a view!    Then all we had to do was drop down to Pisogne (didn't turn the pedals once!!) over 10 kms of descent.      But, what about the brakes and rims!!!  Had to stop often to allow them to cool down, under peoples hoses, in streams etc... Height climbed 1170 metres 
A nice lazy day planned - we went over to Lovere - all of 6 km.  Went to Tourist Info and got lots of good info. Then  to Biblioteca (Library) where Rog updated the journal. Coffee in cafe's beside the lake, shade is required as 40+ Deg C in the sun.    Planning to have 1 easy day followed by 1 longer day. May use the train Northwards or the Lake Ferry to reach points South. Not able to load photos here as they only have Windows 98 and I need ME or XP. Oh well, that's to look forward to. 
After arriving, we set off clockwise around the island. There are very few cars allowed here, most of the travel is done on the scooter. So roads don't have to be very wide - most are less than 7 feet. First stop was to visit an 11th century castle - the guide book stated we could get close. They forgot to say that it was private property, and the closest we could get was a gate, with hardly any views.    Decided to climb to the top of the island where there is a 'sanctuary' (church to most of us) at 600 metres.  Got as far as Cure and when the tarmac stopped and the cobbles started, we decided that we didn't really want to see it anyway. Plus the temperature was rising again. Lunch in a field, overlooking the lake, with ferries dotting about.      On setting off again, got lost in tiny streets of Masse, finally found our way out to Carzano, where we swam in the lake. Finally, back to catch the 16:00 hrs ferry back to Pisogne. Height climbed 340 metres. 
Today we plan to cycle thro' Lovere to Rivo di Solto, then climb over to Lago di Endine. We were disappointed, as it's an area of outstanding beauty, NO swimming is allowed in the Lake. Picnic amongst Italian families B-B-q'ing (in that heat!!).    Back over the hill, we stopped for a coffee at a cafe overlooking Lake Iseo, we calculated we have drunk 7 litres of water between us today. Rog had a Pistachio and Hazlenut ice cream (Ali had a lick). Back at the campground we had supper with a German cycling couple we had met - Armin and Mel, who are leaving tomorrow.  A couple of bottles of wine were consumed (or 3 maybe) Just before we went to be, there was some spectacular lightning - maybe we will have a storm and the temperature will drop. Height climbed 515 metres 
Set off for Marone, via an old road right beside the lake. It's closed during the week to allow the overhanging cliffs to be made safe, but opened up for the locals to walk, cycle, stroll along.      Lovely, no cars at all. After Marone, we climbed up towards Zone and the Pyramidi - which are clay pillars topped out with rocks. What has happened, is that the rock on top, has protected the clay underneath from eroding as fast as the surrounding countryside and you are left with these pillars - about 6 in all - most weird.    There was a new priest due to arrive in Zone and the coloured ribbons and banners were all out to welcome Don Stefano. Thought about climbing up to another mountain pass, but both feeling knackered from so much relentless heat, so back down hill agai.  Taking care not to overheat the brakes and rims. On the way back we stopped to watch wind surfers.      Back to Pisogne just as a short shower started. Sheltered in a cafe. Whilst have supper, at about 20:00 hrs, it started to rain again. We quickly got into the tent to have our pudding, when the heavens opened. We were priviledged to have lightning every 5 seconds and continuous rthunder for at least the next 2 hours - fell asleep so don't know when it stopped.  Over 1 inch of water must have fallen, because the wine glass was nearly full in the morning. Height climbed 510 metres. 
Swim and laze around on the beach all morning. Internet and shop in the afternoon. Met a New Zealand couple, who are travelling from Naples to London on bikes.  Maybe another NZ bed in Christchurch there! Eat in the evening, then the rain started. Had half the meal under canvas and early to bed. 
Set off at 09:30 towards Azzone (up in the hills).  After Rogno, climbed towards Capo di Lago. It was hairpin bends all the way, often every 50 yards! Got to the village and the road stopped, just a lane thro' the village (wide enough for a scooter and not much else - as we found out).    Just past the village we came upon a small Lake - Lago Moro.  Continued climbing to Angolo Terme and didn't like the look of the weather AND Ali had a loose crown, so we set off back to Pisogne. Got addresses for Dentists from the campsite owner and the 2nd one we tried was available.  In just 15 minutes all was solved. That just wouldn't happen in the UK. And it only cost us 20.    Leaving the dentist we found a lovely fruit and veg shop, so bought for our supper. Had a celebratory wine (any excuse will do!). Rog had a 'Chocolate and Hazlenut' ice cream. Ali had a lick! Height climbed 365 metres 
     Turned UP towards Castlefranco, S.Viglio and Monti (at 841 metres). Dropped to Angolo Terme (where we got to yesterday) (at 420 metres). Had lunch beside a church at 12:00 hrs.  It played a lovely tune on the bells. Just as it finished, the church over the valley started up with another tune.  So lovely, the church in Pisogne, can't seem to play tunes, just discordant dongs! Onwards towards Dezzo di Scalve (decided not to go for Azzone at another 220 metres!). Beside the River Dezzo all the way to 752 metres. However, tunnels, the first we bypassed on the old road for 1.6 kilometres.     The next, there was no option - it was lit though. The third, we thought we would try this old road again, well not a good idea.  Carved out of the cliff face, the barrier at best 2 feet high, if at all, the drop down to the river about 500 feet at times - scary!"    Got to Dezzo at 14:00 hrs. Damn, all closed until 15:00 hrs. Not much here anyway, so what to do but go back downhill - through all bar the first tunnel! Got to Lago Moro, hoping for a swim, but the locals were not impressed by 'foreigners' and were outright intimidating. So we left them and carried on back to Pisogne.  It had started to rain when we hit the main road, had to stop 3 times for heavy showers, then just before Pisogne the roads were bone dry. The rain was only in the hills! Back at the site, we went for a swim, as if we hadn't had enough water for 1 day! Glass of wine with some Brits in a motorhome, supper just before the rain started again. To early bed, after all the climbing. Height climbed 1080 metres 
Hot, Hot, Hot again. Got up late, moved tent to allow grass to grow. Went to beach, swam, sunbathed, swam, sunbathed, got pink!    Shopped, had wine, eat and to bed. Oh yes, an Austrian motorcycle tour set up at the other end of the campsite, sang bavarian beer cellar songs from 22:00 to 02:00 hrs.  We are so tired from the heat etc. went to sleep at 24:00 hrs No distance or height today. 
   Went to market in Pisogne, bought some food etc..  It's interesting, that here in Italy, the railway lines are NOT fenced in.    Back to beach for swim and laze around. Rog went to the Biblioteca to do the internet by himself. 
Visited the market and bought food for lunch.     Onwards to the Yacht Club to watch boats being got ready for a sail. It was so hot, we sat a while, and a while longer. Then guess what - decided too hot to cycle, so back to Pisogne. Lunch at the campground, swim in the lake, laze around etc... At 19:00, into town - La Cantina del Cavaliere - who were to give us a 'surprise' Italian meal to celebrate our anniversary. The meal was fantastic. Stared with a glass of bubbly, starter of small morsels (don't ask me what they were), pasta with a sauce for 2nd's, followed by a meat balls etc as a 3rd course. All wasked down with a litre of red wine.  The lot for Euro 33 (22). Back to the campground for coffee and 2 Amaretto's each! 
On arrival, went looking for a campground for the next 3 nights. First one we came to, the owner jumped out and invited us to stay - even knocked the price down from Euro 22 to 20. Done we said. He even threw in a table and 2 chairs for our stay - great. (Camping Punta D'Ora). Went in search of a supermarket and did shopping for next days, back to the site for a wine in the bar.
Dropped down to Ome, at the edge of the plain. Wandered around this wine area, vines everywhere, interspersed with fields of maize. Little villages, each with their churches. Back to the site by 14:00 hrs, changed into swimming costumes and went for a swim. Height climbed 760 metres.
Decided to visit the local nature reserve - flooded peat bogs. Followed 'footpaths around - not meant to cycle, but no-one else around. Only saw a swan, a grebe and some dragonflies!  Visited a Monastery - guess what, closed!  Back to site for a swim - still in the high 30's.
**** hot again  35 - 42 deg c. Lots of traffic, tempers getting frayed. Went to train station to check times for tomorrow, then up to the YH, where we packed the bikes away, before our last supper of pizza. Height climbed 310 metres.
Firstly we asked for a 'large' taxi. A car turned up, too small for our bags. The driver dumped our bags on the road and left! Whe tried to order another one - they said we would have to pay for the first one. We missed the planned train! Luckily, a later one would still do. Finally, a large taxi turned up and charged us Euro 20 for a Euro 10 journey. Train to Milan Central station, then bus to the airport.  Bikes weighed and charged Euro 52 for excess baggage. Through to departures - plane delayed 1 hour. Instead of have 2 hours for transfer at Stanstead, we got 1 hour. They close booking 40 mins before departure.  Mad panic, 20 mins to collect baggage, clear customs, check in etc... Just managed it. Met in Edinburgh by friends (Jessie & Graham) who put us up for the night.  I DON'T want another day like this!!!
What a relief. Now all the washing / reading 6 weeks of mail etc... that accompanies any extended journey/holiday.


Valiant plans to assemble the bike at the airport and ride off into the sunrise were curtailed by these credit card woes and general exhaustion.  I took a hotel in Crawley and got a courtesy shuttle ride. I assembled the bike without too much difficulty.  The brakes, as always, were a little tricky to get aligned.  I eventually got them though the rear brakes are a little looser than I like.  They still manage to stop me though, good enough. I'll have to carry the bike suitcase tomorrow until I find a post office.  That shouldn't really be a problem as it folds up pretty well.   
The plan for today was to take it fairly easy, little did I guess the number of hills en route.  I took the Sustrans route down, it worked out pretty well.  I suppose I was immediately spoiled by signs as there was a brief section without signage that annoyed me a tad, like I can't read a map and figure things out for myself from time to time. Apparently in my training I ignored rolling hills.  As I thought about it, Los Angeles just doesn't have that many rolling hills, you're either in the hills or on flat land, not much rolling to be found.  That was a mistake on my part, not the first or the last I assure you. I made it ok, I'm bumming around Brighton for the day.  I was a little worried about getting a hotel.  I called about four places and they all noted that this is Bankers Holiday, and due to the fact that the weather is also incredible, that everything is going to be booked solid.  Oops.  I found a place in the north section as I rode into town.  I don't know if I'm lucky to find a place or not, but I found a place, good enough for me. The post offices are also closed today, so I had to carry my bike suitcase along, not a huge deal, but just an extra few pounds which just aren't necessary. Brighton is an interesting town, I suspect if you like San Francisco, you'd like this place.  It has a nice dichotomy of a lively alternative small retail dives and corporate commercial crap stores.  (Gap, Borders, blah blah blah) Not sure what tomorrow holds for me, til next time... 
As I hit went outside, I noticed the weather had turned from an absolutely beatiful ~65 or so to ~50-55 and, uh, WINDY.  The temperature didn't bother me a bit, in fact I prefer biking in colder weather, well, as long as it's above 50.  The wind however, well thats just another story....      One thing I immediately noticed about the wind, it was directly in my face, the whole way, and it was blowing hard.  Nothing like pedalling along madly in granny gear going downhill to manage 9 miles an hour.  I managed to take a small accidental detour on the way down to polegate which added a few miles to my trip, mostly uphill, but I suppose I got to come back down the hill with the wind to recover.  All in all, not really worth it. I was going quite slow and didn't get to Polegate until around 4:30pm.  Even though it is the big holiday weekend, I was hoping to find a hotel rather quickly and pack it in, as I was quite tired.  The problem is, there is only one hotel in Polegate, oops.  Even better, that hotel is a student run establishement, and as such, was closed for the holiday.  This bankers holiday is causing me no end of fits. To top it off, my rear tire seems to have developed a very slow leak which is requiring me to fill it up every few miles.  I suppose I could've changed the tube, but it was starting to get late and the "Find a place for the night" panic was slowly invading my brain. I made the decision to push on to Eastbourne.  By this time, the weather had dropped below 50 and the wind was still strong, and in my face.  Joy. I made it Eastbourne around 6:30pm, and I was in full panic about the availability of hotels. It is after all, the holiday weekend. Luckily, the hotels are tightly congregeted in one area and I was able to check several in rapid succession.  The third place had a vacancy, and for cheap!  so I was quite the happy camper.  The owner was kind and let me pull the bike inside for the night, there's no way it would've fit up the tight staircase (all four flights, ugh), so it stayed in the guest lounge, nice. All in all, it was a rough day, spent much time pushing the bike up hills and getting windburn in my face.  How great is that!    Show links to this Hide links to this     
I went outside to another WINDY day, yes, once again, directly in my face.  Not to worry though, the map indicated this day would only be 18 miles, I can go that far in my sleep. I rode for a few miles until I picked up the main trail which was to take me down to Hastings.  Funny thing about trails, they go in two directions, the way you want to go and the way you don't want to go.  The intersection where I intercepted the trail had lovely signage pointing me down the trail.  Unfortunately, the intersection was a roundabout, and the the next road after the one I took had lovelier signage indicating the trail went this was as well, and in the direction I wanted to go. So, I wandered off in the direction I didn't want to go for about 4 miles.  It was really beautiful rolling through the countryside between farms and far off castles.  I was enjoying the view so much, I didn't notice several warning signs, 1> no headwinds, 2> going far away from the ocean, 3> mileage signs to the town I was going were pointed in the opposite direction. Ok, I'll admit the 3rd one kind of got me thinking it was about time to turn around.  After all, I'd gone about 4 miles, and instead of being in an oceanside town, I was far from the ocean, with no town in sight crossing major roads which didnt appear on the map. Back I went....  Yes into the headwind, but again, through the lovely countryside.  Did I mention the wind was blowing, hard? I went back to the roundabout and noticed the brilliant signage at the next road which is in fact, the way I wanted to be going....  All in all, it was about a one hour detour, no major worries, but less than ideal. After I got back on track, the trail went down near the ocean, which simply meant there was nothing to block the headwinds. I rolled into Hastings around 3pm, and went to the hotel.  This time, I was smart and called ahead to make reservations. Again, the owners were very kind about the bike, it's now sitting in a private bathroom completely out of the way...  Once again, there's no way it would've made it up the four flights of stairs required to get to my room.  (Did I mention climbing four flights of stairs after a full day of riding is somewhat painful?) I plan on taking the day off tomorrow to see what's happening around Hastings.  So far it seems to be a cross between Myrtle Beach and some medieval town.  Old castle on top of the hill, cheesy tourist garbage along the shore...  Off to find a pub, must get a beer.   
  
I fell in with a family that was riding part of the route I was riding.  It was nice to be led through the twists and turns of Rye as I certainly would have got myself lost in that town.  Spent much of the day riding trails and bike paths having a great time. I got to Hythe without much difficulty and found I'd made reservations in the town of Hythe which is located in a completely different part of the country.  Oh well.  I found a B&B no problem. Hythe is a very pretty town, but I was a little confused as to why most everything shut down at 5pm, even the restaurants.  Oh well. Overall, it's amazing how things are looking up after the end of the &!$^* Bank Holiday!         
I spent about 5 miles riding along the Cliffs of Dover (sometimes within 30 yards of the edge) starting at the Battle of Britain memorial.  This experience stunned me, and I'm frankly at a loss for words on how best to describe the experience.  It's something I'll never forget.         
Glad to not be hungover this morning as I'd had a few pints at a pub last night.  The Manchester United - Real Madrid match was on, it was quite a scene at the pub.  I can't imagine what it must have been like up in Manchester. I was expecting rain in the afternoon so I got an early start and cruised through the day. The only real challenge was the 13% climb back to the top of the cliffs from the town of Dover.  The road ran around Dover castle, so it was nice to look at as I pushed my bike up the hill... Speaking of Dover castle.  I checked it out yesterday.  It has an amazing history. It had been in active military/government service for oh, about 1000 years prior to the 1960's.  Given the strategic location in regards to Europe, the castle must have seen some amazing things.  It's got exhibits from nearly every time period from ~1200 to WWII.  The range of artillery pieces was a good example as they had: a medieval trebuchet, 18th century cannons, 19th century bombard cannons, WWII howitzers.  I rode along the cliffs for less than a mile before the road turned inland.  I made my best average speed yet as it was downhill and I had tailwinds for a good part of the day. As I was expecting afternoon rain, I cruised through the towns of Deal, which didn't look all that interesting anyway, and Sandwich.  Sandwich looked like a nice town, wish I stayed to look around a bit, especially since the rains never came. I got in to Canterbury around noon and found a room in a hotel about 2 blocks from the cathedral.       
Tomorrow morning, I'll be taking the train to Colchester.  This will get me around the Thames river, and there just isn't much I'd like to see by bike if I were to bike it. I should be back on the bike either Sunday or Monday depending on whether or not I want to stay an extra day in Colchester. I received a number of questions from many of you, I'll be putting up a FAQ page one of these days.  Probably the next time it rains.  In the meantime, I'll be quite happy to keep the weather as it's been.     

By the time I finished eating, the rain had finished, so I was definitely leaving.  One thing about storms coming from the southeast, they gave me excellent tailwinds for most of the ride.  It's quite nice to ride uphills at 15 miles an hour vs 10 going downhill into the wind.  I'm starting to adjust to the rolling hills, or maybe my legs were just rested as I haven't been on the road for a few days as I chugged up hills without much problem today.  Though they weren't very steep. I had another flat on the rear tire.  That's two in like ten days, further inspection of the rear tire shows it's getting pretty worn out.  I'll switch the front and rear tires in the next day or two and load up on tubes just to be sure. Otherwise the ride was pretty eventful.  Funny sight of the day.  This old guy was riding his bike down the sidewalk with a cigarette in his mouth and talking on his cellphone, sort of steering with one hand.  He proceeds to steer off the sidewalk and crash into some bushes.  I'm pretty sure he was drunk.  He seemed alright though, so I chuckled my way down the road. I can only laugh as I know I've done the same thing before... Tomorrow is a big day, expecting about 45 miles.
The ride though devoid of many major events was a nice trek through the backroads of Essex into Suffolk. The ride went fairly quickly as the good weather and tailwinds continued.  I considered pushing on to Beccles but didn't want to push another 30 miles and there didn't seem to be much in between the two towns besides farmlands. My rear tire is pretty well completly shot.  I had another flat on the ride.  I wound up rotating the tires in Framlingham, hopefully that'll help the situation some. Framlingham is a beatiful town.  The castle was home to Queen (Bloody) Mary when she was announced as the queen after Edward VI (son of Henry VIII) died.  Pushing on to Beccles tomorrow. 
The ride was another ride through the backroads through the rolling hills of Suffolk.  The weather continues to hold for me as well.  Apparently it has been raining in most other parts of the country.  I keep watching the weather and they keep saying it's going to rain, so far good luck though. Funny sighting of the day, I was biking down the road in the country, several miles from anything but farms, and from the other direction comes this French guy on one of those really old cycles, the one's with the 5 foot front wheel and small rear wheel.  I mean, it's an ancient bike.  He's wearing goggles and one of those caps fighter pilots used to wear in WWI.  I wave at me and he yells out something in Frech and continues on his way.  Hilarious. I'm off to explore Beccles, maybe I'll get a haircut as it's really getting ridiculous. 
The ride itself wasn't too bad, but the mileage was shorter than expected.  The map had the mileage at 28 miles, which would normally mean I'd get about 30-32 miles in due to getting lost etc.  But, I made it into Norwich and found a hotel at 25 miles.  I did that while taking a wrong turn somewhere and getting somewhat off course.  It may be that saved me a few miles.  the trip was otherwise uneventful.  I rode for a mile or so along the Yare river, which was beautiful.  I rode along a sewage treatment plant for about 1/2 mile, which wasn't beautiful, and didn't smell beautiful either... I got into Norwich early and had a good look around town.  I'll see the sights tomorrow.  This town has like several cathedrals and churches which have been around in some form since before the Americas were discovered, nutty.  It's even got a huge Roman Catholic cathedral.  That's probably got an interesting history during Elizabeth's rain.     
I got a haircut and bought a decent shirt this morning so I'm not feeling like such a slug, which is nice.  I may even have someone take my picture with the bike now. Norwich is quite a nice city.  It's got a permanent outdoor market which has everything you'd expect, from useless crap to hidden gems in used book and music stores.  The cathedral, though not as nice as canterbury, is pretty amazing also. Decision time.  Due to my slower than expected pace recently, and due to the fact that I want to spend more time in Scotland, I'm going to train up the coast a bit in a couple of days.  I'll proceed up to Fakenham and move on to King's Lynn the next day as planned.  In King's Lynn I'll get my tires replaced and take a train up to York.  This should give me an extra few days in Scotland.  York is also south of the "mountains" in England (the Wolds?), so I'll get to push my bike uphill some more.  I haven't pushed my bike up a hill in about a week and I quite miss it. Plus, the stretch between King's Lynn and York doesn't have much in the way of bigger towns or sites I'd like to see.  As a dear friend pointed out, "You can ride through beautiful countryside (in the states)".  Can't argue with that.  So, the train it is...     
The path started off fine, paved and hard packed dirt, which even after the rain held up well.  About 12 miles into the route, the path got pretty muddy.  It was pretty entertaining taking my road bike through some of this.  Despite my clutzy tendencies, I managed to get all the way through without falling.  I was quite a mess afterwards, and that was with fenders.  (Thank god for the fenders though, they were absolutely caked...) After the offroad section ended, the last 20 or so miles was a breeze. I got into Fakenham around 1pm, and couldn't check into my hotel until 3.  I couldn't even drop my things off as no one was there.  That seems to be pretty common in B&B's over here.  So I pedalled down to a pub close to the hotel. I walked in and noticed two things that were a little bit odd.   1> Everybody was wearing red.  2> They all seemed to be looking at me longer than the normal, "who the hell is that person just walking in the door" glance. I looked around and quickly noted that the Manchester United game had just started.  Manchester U. wears red.  Their opponent was wearing all black.  Very similar to my all black biking outfit that I was wearing.....   Oops. It didn't take them too long to figure out that I was just a dumb american and all was well.   It didn't hurt that by this point I can name about 1/2 the starting line up for Man. U. and can discuss in great detail the relative merits of David Beckam and whether or not the team is better off with him or without him (but with the 30 million pounds it would take to by him) and screw Real Madrid anyway....... Several pints of beer later the game was over and I was off to check into the hotel.  Always an adventure after several pints of beer. After sleeping for an hour or so, I called the bike store in Kings Lynn to make sure they got my new tires.  Turns out they didn't.  Ouch.  So, I wandered into town on the laughable chance they might have tires that will do the trick.  Turns out this is a very well equipped bike store and they actually had kevlar lined touring tires in my unusual size.  (700x28, unusual over here at least).    Not my preferred brand, but they only need to last another 300-400 miles and I'm set.   A little more tire changing (I'm an expert at this point) and a good test drive, and I seem to be good to go, we'll find out...         
I managed the hills without many problems.  This is good as the real hills are still in front of my, after York and up in Scotland. I got into Kings Lynn and well, if you can't say anything nice....  Actually, it was yet another nice town, but something about not being able to find a pub open near my hotel was quite distressful.  Actually, everything was closed.   I had a fine evening watching the Snooker world championship finals in my hotel room.   Glad I got my tires as the prospect of taking a day off in this down would just be bad.  Off to York tomorrow by train.     
York Minster is the focal point of this city.  It pretty well dominates the skyline.  To say it's massive and impressive beyond words would be an understatement.  It took 250 years to build the thing.  Not to start any religious wars, but to say this thing was built for the glory of god is a bit ludicrous.  Clearly this is a case of an out of control church.  Still though, it's awesome, words and pictures simply won't do it justice. Spent both nights exploring the various aspects of Yorks nightlife and had a fine time all the way around.  Played multi-player war with Simpsons trading cards the first night while having far too many pints to go with it.  Spent the next night hanging out with a Canandian woman who was touring the country the slighty more sane way, with a backpack and trains.  She followed a very similar route that I did going through the south and southeast.  Given that I was riding the next day, I probably had too many pints, but it was a fine evening of making fun of English, uh, peculiarities.         
I got to Easingwold, checked into my hotel, did laundry, and chilled out for most of the day.  It was a small town, so not much was happening, and after the past couple of days, that was fine with me. Braveheart was on TV.  British TV is nice as they don't edit movies for language or nudity, or commercials.  However, they did still run the news at 10pm for 1/2 hour during the middle of the movie.  I'll add that to the peculiar English behavior list.
The riding was great today.  Spent the first 15 or so miles climbing into the "mountains" in northern England.  There were some pretty sharp climbs, though the steep sections were shortish, thank goodness.  Once again, I didn't have to push my bike up any hills, though I stopped quite a bit when I'd get to the top of a climb.   I got to the Northallerton train station with 3 minutes to spare before my train left.  I didn't really know what time they left, I just got lucky.  Off to explore Newcastle, where I'll probably have a pint or two, of Newcastle.       
Newcastle itself isn't a bad city.  They've clearly been investing in improvements to cultural activities.  A nice art museum opened fairly recently which I quite liked.  You can tell Newcastle used to be a highly industrial city. Of course, Newcastle is also the home to Newcastle beer.  I kind of expected it to be in all the bars, but in fact, I didn't see it on tap in any of the bars I went to, odd, their loss.   
The ride started off in fairly annoying fashion as I had to wind my way through Newcastle before catching a bike path which ran along the Tyne river.  The bike path had beautiful scenery and a lot of broken beer bottles on it, ah college kids... After winding through several more towns losing the trail on multiple occasions, I finally just hit a main road and stayed with it.  Sometimes the marked bike paths are more trouble than they are worth. Once outside of the towns around the Tyne river, the scenery had changed dramatically from what I saw in central and southern England.  I've got many pictures as I got quite tired by the end of the ride, so I stopped a lot. Amble itself is a small but beautiful fishing town along the coast.  I got in pretty late and didn't get much chance to explore.       
The riding today was difficult as I was both tired and either had strong headwinds or crosswinds for most of the day.  It was another beautiful ride with coastal scenery, castles, golf courses, cliffs, and sheep for nearly the entire ride.  Again, due to the fact that I stopped even more than yesterday, I've got some good pictures of this ride. A shocking note, I actually had a bit of rain today.  Though the sun never stopped shining, I got rained on for about 2 minutes.  As I was pulling over to get out my rain jacket, the rain lightened and quit.  This would be the second time I've been rained on when riding.  I don't know what I've done to deserve this weather, I have a bad feeling my rain is getting saved up for Scotland when the weather will also be cold, very cold. I'm taking a day off in Berwick, one last day in England for a while.  It's got an interesting history as its changed possesion between England and Scotland 14 times.      Show links to this Hide links to this           
Still though, Berwick is a rather nice town and my legs could use the rest after cranking hard for two days and looking at the hills of Scotland during the run into Edinburgh. I started off with breakfast at the B&B.  As a note, some time ago I got completely sick of the traditional english breakfast.  I'll be happy to not eat eggs and sausage for some time after this trip.  However, I noticed there breakfast included both Haggis and Black pudding.  So, I chose the big breakfast and had my first taste of Haggis and Black pudding.  The haggis wasn't too bad, though I don't think I'll make it a staple.  The black pudding, um, yeah, nothing good to say about that really. Took a guided tour of Berwick and met a older couple who were taking a cycle tour as well.  They were coming in from the west, where I'll be headed and complained about the hills, but liked the tailwinds.  I guess this means I'll get to do the same hills into the wind, joy.   
I took a more direct route in order to avoid the heavy rains which I expected to start around noon.  Well, they didn't start until 2, but now it's pouring, so I'll be heading straight to a pub in just a few minutes. Big news of the day, I hit Scotland just a few miles into the ride.  That's right, I'm in the land of the Highlander, scotch whisky and groundskeeper Willie.           
Innerleithen is a nice town about 40 miles south of Edinburgh.  There was a good scene at the bar downstairs as Celtic was playing their final match before the big match this weekend in Spain for the European Cup.       
Pretty early into the trip, I passed four Canadians who were going on the same route I was riding.  I actually saw them twice yesterday as well. Once in Galashiels as they were getting off their bikes and heading into the library there.  I also saw them pull into innerleithen several hours after I arrived.  One of them had a flat.  I asked if they needed assistance, but didn't stick around The trip out of Innerleither turned north so I didn't have winds blasting me in the face, that was a refreshing change of pace.  The ride started with a long 10 mile or so climb into the Moorpath hills.  I actually hit the highest point about sea level of the trip today, around 400 meters.  However, the grade was pretty shallow and I rode most of the way up with a few gears to spare.   At the top, I was rewarded with a decent view of Edinburgh  (a little hazy, so pics may not be great) and a long gradual decent.  These are much better than steep drops as I don't need to ride the brakes. After the hills, I added an extra several miles by missing turns and taking the wrong turns several times.  Naviagating through suburban towns can be something of a pain. I finally made it into Edinburgh.  I'm staying in a hostel for the first time.  I'm staying with a Canadian and a Spanish guy.  I think I've met more Canadians on this trip than any other nationality eh.         
I took a train from Edinburgh to Inverness.  At this point, I didn't have a plan for the next section of my journey.  I had vague plans to southeast through distillery country and St Andrews back to Edinburgh or southwest to Glasgow or North to John O' Groats, the most northernly city on the British Island mainland.  At this point, I had about 4 days of available time left and these all would have worked out ok. As happens, I made it to Inverness and fell in love with the town and met some great people at the hostel.  So, instead of moving on, I called it a trip and decided to stay in Inverness.  I took day rides down the loch ness and to Culloden battlefield and the Black Island, relaxed a lot, and hit many pubs. I took one van tour up to Orkney Island for a day.  Orkney Island was beautiful, but the tour itself was miserable for me.  Riding in a cramped van and going on someone else's time schedule wasn't my thing, at all.  Of course, it would've taken me a week to bike that distance, so it was probably worth it. After Inverness, I headed back down to Edinburgh where I met my parents for a couple of days.  Dad was on his way back from Iraq so it was a convenient for him to stop by.  After Edinburgh, I hit London for a week and badly missed the cycle.

I had some extensive knee surgery a couple of years ago (Meniscus clean-out, ACL reconstruction, Microfracture, and (ouch)Osteotomy).  Biking has been the best thing for my knee and seems to be the activity that gives me the least pain.  Bill also had some knee surgery--a Meniscus clean-out--and he feels his operated knee is considerably stronger now than before the surgery. We live in a rural area with plenty of hills--in pretty much any direction.  You get to the point when you bike that you simply put your head down and grind out the hill.  I'm not sure that it even gets easier as time goes on--but I do know that you come to the realization that it probably won't be as bad as you thought it would be--that it may take some time and a rest stop or two, but you'll make it.  I compare everything to a hill near our house called Allen Canyon--it's the hill by which I measure all other hills.  It took me 3 tries to get up that hill without stopping, and having done it, I know I can do it again tomorrow.       
We drove from our home in Ridgefield, WA to Anacortes in about 4 hours, leaving the Explorer at the Park 'n Ride which is just south of Anacortes, off Hwy 20.  The Park 'n Ride is about 9 miles from the ferry terminal, a pleasant enough ride with wide shoulders on Hwy 20, a section of residential riding, and then back on Hwy 20 for the last couple of miles to the ferry dock.  You can also leave your car at the ferry terminal--the charge is $5-7 depending on the length of your stay.  We wanted to make the 2:40 ferry to Friday Harbor and were in plenty of time.  We had checked the ferry schedules online at www.wsdot.wa.gov/ferries/, and the nice thing about both the Washington State ferries and the BC ferries is that bikes and walk-ons are most always guaranteed passage.  Though they want you to be in line 20 minutes before the scheduled departure, they load first, and unload first.  The ferry ride to Friday Harbor took about an hour and on the way we met a couple from Eugene who were headed to San Juan to do some camping.  We had all picked a good week to tour--the temperatures were in the 70's, with sunny skies predicted for the next few days.  When we unloaded at Friday Harbor, we parked the bikes and went to Friday's Crabhouse for a bowl of smoked salmon clam chowder.  Friday's overlooks the ferry terminal and we had a good view of the seemingly endless stream of cars coming off the ferry and the crowd of walk-ons that were headed back to Anacortes.   We rode the short 2 1/2 miles to our B & B--the Oakridge--and checked in.  We had never stayed in a bed and breakfast before, so this was going to be a new experience for us.  The owners--Tom and Maria--greeted us with a glass of ice water--always welcome to a cyclist.  We left our bags and headed out to Lime Kiln Park, on the west side of San Juan Island, to see if the whale pods were feeding.  San Juan Island is hilly and windy, but not unpleasantly so.  When you get out to Lime Kiln you can often see the whales from the shoreline, but we were about an hour too late.  A message board at the park lets visitors know when and where the whales were last spotted.  There are also plenty of boats that can be chartered to whale watch--and these seldom fail to find the pods that hang out year-round in the San Juans.   We biked back to the Oakridge and got a recommendation for dinner--Vinnie's.  Bill had lasagne and I had "pasta from hell-prawns from heaven".  The service was excellent--I'd give it a 9/10 on my "biased as all get out" scale. We biked back to the B & B around 9:00, so it was starting to get dark and we turned on our rear flashers just to be on the safe side. Breakfast was wonderful.  Fresh fruit, homemade, steaming scones with butter and jam, granola, and hot tea, accompanied by classical music.  Tom and Maria are interesting people, having lived on the island for about 7 years.  Tom is an engineer and Maria is a teacher now involved with Elderhostel.  They moved here from Alaska.  They have seen Tom Selleck and Sandra Bullock on the island, and probably countless others as well.  Their house is an older "craftsman" house--with lovely, creaky wood floors and paneled doors with ornate brass knobs.  The big porch faced the harbor and it reminded me of my grandmother's house.  We thoroughly enjoyed our stay, but hey...we had a ferry to catch.           
We caught the 9:30 ferry which travels north then west along the coast of San Juan Island to Sidney, British Columbia. Before we boarded, we talked with a couple on a tandem from Monterey, CA.  He was 70, and we didn't think it polite to ask her age, but I'd say she was close to that.  I hope I'm still riding when I'm their age.  They were headed to Victoria and then Orcas Island, but had no desire to climb Mt. Constitution, the highest point on the San Juan Islands.  The ferry to Sidney takes a little over an hour, so we read and watched as island after island peeled away behind us.  After "putzing" around the Sidney a little, we stopped at Starbucks, made a few phone calls, and decided to go to the whale museum.  It's a "donations appreciated" museum, and the exhibits were quite well-done. Did you know that the gestation period of an elephant is around 22 months, but a blue whale is usually 10-11 months?   We had some time to kill before we could check in to The Flying Pig, our Sidney B & B, so we rode down Lochside Dr. from the ferry dock. Just before Lochside Dr. crosses Hwy 17, there is a trail on the left hand side of the road (I didn't think it was very well-marked--small white sign with blue lettering) called Lochside trail.  This asphalt and/or hard-packed gravel trail runs all of the way to Victoria some 25 miles to the south.  It is connected to other trail systems as well, (the Galloping Goose) and overall, we found Vancouver Island to be very bike-friendly.  When we were on roads without shoulders, cars seemed to give us plenty of room.   We had gotten great directions to the Oakridge B & B on San Juan, but I only had an address for the Flying Pig.  Not to worry--we have MapPoint.  It's the first time we have found it to be inaccurate.  I think it was a 12-mile missed turn mistake, but a beautiful 12 miles around(and back)Patricia Bay.  We were mostly miffed because we didn't decide to turn back until we were at the BOTTOM of a hill we had cruised down.  The other problem, was that I had done all of the map routing, but Bill was the lead rider.  I prefer him to be in front, but we knew we had to communicate a little better.  We turned back, and found our way and were on their doorstep in no time. Rose and Brick Betsworth own the Flying Pig.  It's a gorgeous place just up a hill from Sunset Beach, nestled in the trees.  Rose showed us to our room, made sure we knew where the ice-cold water was, and while we showered, was baking cookies.  Yeah...I could live like this for awhile.  Hot cookies by the time we were out of the shower.  She suggested the Duinsmore Lodge on McTavish Rd. for dinner, which has a story all its own.  It was owned by a guy who built it as a detox center and expected to make a pile of money from corporate executives who needed to kick their habit.  The expectation was that the corporation would be picking up the expense.  It didn't happen.  The University of Victoria bought it for $1 and the debt it had accrued and today it is a conference center.  I can tell you they manage a lovely dinner with an emphasis on presentation.  Bill had chilled concord grape soup, pork tenderloin with a fig and cognac sauce, roasted potatoes and apples, I had butter lettuce with toasted hazelnuts and a sherry vinagrette dressing, halibut with wild rice in a tamarand and orange sauce.  For dessert we shared a licorice and white chocolate cheesecake, and it came to us with "happy 30th anniversary" written in chocolate on the plate. Rose must have told them...  One other thing...Rose told us that there was a hill in getting to the Duinsmore Lodge, and she was correct.  It would get 3 chevrons on my map, thank goodness it was only a half mile long.  We rode the short 4 miles or so back to the Flying Pig and got there just in time to catch the evening sunset.  So peaceful and I think we were the only ones on the beach.         
Though Bill and I were newbies at the B & B thing, we were becoming enthusiastic believers.  Rose served a hearty breakfast, beginning with local, fresh strawberries with yogurt and granola, sausage, and pancakes as light as "thistledown" (sorry...I couldn't resist...it was actually the name of one of the roads on San Juan Island, and it's been in my head ever since).   We rode down West Saanich Road to the Brentwood Bay ferry terminal.  These six miles of road didn't have shoulders most of the way, and it was busy, but neither Bill nor I felt unsafe as cars gave us plenty of room when they passed, or waited to do so. The ferry from Brentwood Bay to Mill Bay is called Vancouver Island's prettiest shortcut.  Hard to disagree...It's a small ferry, holding a little more than a dozen cars, and it takes about a half hour to cross.  I liked the ferry handlers--they seemed so accomodating, so helpful.  One of them gave me a map of the wineries in the area (there were 13 within a 25 mile radius of Mill Bay). We were headed to Mill Bay to see a friend of mine.  Suzanne Johnston and her husband Bob own Kilmalu Farms, a nursery specializing in daylilies and grasses.  Check out their website at www.kilmalu.com .  We got to her place just after noon and her three deputies were waiting for us.  She has three yellow labs--Ginger, Jake and Jessie, and together they showed us the display garden, shade house, and the two-story home that they designed themselves.  I think the roof line of their house is "very cool".  We had a cup of tea, visited, laughed, and then headed back to Mill Bay.  Suzanne passed on some information that the locals all know--if you buy your ferry ticket at the supermarket in Mill Bay, it's 30% cheaper.  Done.  We rode back to the ferry dock, waited,(you do spend a fair amount of time waiting, but the weather was sunny and warm, so we just kicked back and talked with the other people waiting) and caught the 4:10 ferry to Brentwood Bay. It was early, but we went ahead and rode into Brentwood and found a little Greek restaurant called Piccolo's.  On my BAAGO (biased as all get out) scale I'd say it was a 6.  Service was great, food was okay.  The waitress DID tell Bill that Dino's secret ingredient in the meat sauce was cinnamon.  Bill had ribs and spaghetti, I had halibut and vegetables.  We biked the 6 miles north on West Saanich Road with a fair amount of traffic, and got to the Flying Pig around 7.  After a shower we vegged in the loft and watched a mixture of Mariner baseball and news.  Oh...and we ate the rest of the chocolate-dipped strawberries that Rose had given us to put in the fridge.             
Another great breakfast--strawberry/banana smoothies, bran and date muffins, scrambled eggs, pork and apple sausage, toast with homemade jams, a big pot of tea.  Brick is a pilot for Canada Air and he also runs fishing charters out of Port Renfrew.  He said they usually get their limit of salmon and halibut.  They have two Maltese terriers, Baby and Tinker, that dance around at the end of breakfast for the leftover pancakes. We thanked our hosts and biked to the ferry terminal (about 5 mi.) and caught the 11:40 ferry.   In order to get to Orcas Island, you have to take the ferry back to Friday Harbor on San Juan Island, and then take the inter-island ferry to Orcas.  It was a 45 minute wait--just long enough to have another cup of that smoked salmon clam chowder at Friday's Crabhouse.  The ride to Orcas is beautiful.  We passed Shaw Island and Lopez Island, both of which are flatter than San Juan, and consequently, lovely for biking.  Orcas, on the other hand, is the hilliest of the San Juans, and we got a good taste of the hills as we biked the 8 1/2 mi. to Double Mountain B & B in Eastsound.   The name of the place should have been an indication to me...it sits atop a 3/4 mi. gravel road.  When we booked the room, Gail the innkeeper said there was a sizable hill to her place, but Bill and I have found that what ONE person thinks is a hill is not necessarily what WE think is a hill.  Gail's hills are our hills.  I couldn't ride it, neither could Bill, so we walked.  I guess you have to have elevation like that in order to have the view like she does.  It was breathtaking.  After a short rest (it was 5 o'clock) we decided that if we were going to do Mt. Constitution, we'd have to do it tonight.  There was another couple at the B & B who said they had driven up to the top that morning and waited for over an hour for the fog and clouds to clear, but had given up.  We had had fantastic weather, clouds in the mornings that usually burned off by noon, however, clouds and rain were due to come in overnight.  We had to go down that hill and back up to eat dinner anyway.  So, off we went. Moran State Park--about 12 miles of riding from her B & B, 5 miles of it up a fairly steep grade.  We were in our lowest gear most of the time.  Bill said we were going so slow we didn't even disturb the wildlife.  At 7:30 we were at the top--2410'.  We did it.  Oh, we stopped several times to catch our breath, but I don't think either of us thought it was as bad as people had told us it would be.  The innkeeper said few people bike to the top. We had another couple take our picture, and then we took a bunch ourselves.  There is a stone tower that Mr. Moran had erected and years after he had died, the park service wanted to tear the structure down because of safety issues.  There was a hearing--and his granddaughter showed up with the original blueprints to show that Mr. Moran had hidden a plaque in the tower which said something to the effect--To him that rebuildeth, glory and fame, to him that destroyeth, eternal damnation.  Interestingly enough, the tower stands. The ride down took less than 15 minutes and we stopped to take a few pictures of some deer just outside of a fence designed to keep them out.  Gail, the innkeeper at Double Mountain, said the deer at Rosario Resort are tame and people feed them all the time.  We ate at Rosie's at Outlook Inn--a bit pricey for us, but we were celebrating the ride to the top of Mt. Constitution.  A couple of glasses of chardonnay, spicy babybacks for Bill, chicken phad thai for me.  Bill also ordered some chocolatey, peanuty, and whipping creamed ice cream dessert that we shared.  A 6 on my BAAGO scale. We turned the tailights on and biked the last couple of miles up to Double Mountain. (Yes, we walked the bikes up the gravel drive again)  Showers and off to sleepy-sleepy land.                 
I was very, VERY happy when I woke up at 5:45 this morning and looked out the window to see a cloud bank pouring in, taking over the sunny skies.  By 8:00 it was foggy and cloudy and you wouldn't have seen anything from the top of Mt. Constitution.  I'm so glad we went last night.  We slept in--rolled out to breakfast around 9:00, met another couple who were staying at Double Mountain, Bob and Elizabeth from Seattle and had another stellar breakfast.  Dutch babies--with powdered sugar and fresh-squeezed lemon, applesauce, sausage, fresh fruit, orange juice, and tea.  A word here about bed and breakfasts.  We opted for this route for two reasons:  first, and most importantly, Bill doesn't really like to camp.  He seldom gets a good night's sleep camping.  And second, we really didn't want the added weight of the camping/cooking gear.  It was a good option for us and I think, given the choice, we would almost always choose a B & B over a motel, and certainly over camping. We took our time packing up--talked with Gail about her family and life as the owner of a bed and breakfast, and left for the ferry terminal a little after 11.  We had quite a wait--it was only 9 miles into town and the ferry didn't leave until 1:50, but we didn't mind--both of us were feeling the climb from yesterday.  The ferry was 1/2 hour late and when we got to Anacortes we should have pulled off to the side and waited for a good while until the cars had cleared out, but we were anxious to get back to our car and head for home.  We did wait for all of the cars to exit the ferry, but we caught up to the long line of cars going into Anacortes.  Fortunately, we took a residential detour and missed a lot of their exhaust.  We felt about a dozen raindrops fall on us as we raced to the Park n' Ride.  This, our first taste of touring, was delicious, indeed.     



   A few months later, we had a more official celebration with our families, in Laguna Beach, CA.  This gave us two good excuses to take a trip: 1)  We needed some way to get back home from California. 2)  As newlyweds, we could justify a taking a big chunk of vacation for our honeymoon
  
  

We immediately learned something that would follow our entire trip:  do NOT ask locals for information about mileages or terrain in their local vicinity.  These people do NOT know, and will only mislead you.  (The cashier at the convenience store estimated that the Paradise Cove campground was "about a mile" from town.  It turned out to be 5.)  The campground was ugly and beat up, but at least empty.  Neither of us would go back, but it was nice to have the trip underway. At this point neither of us thought we had a working camera. For no particular reason, I was convinced that the camera needed a new battery, though I never checked to make sure.  Marilyn, on the other hand, had erased any memory of the photos she'd taken at Hans' birthday party a few weeks prior.   At any rate, when we finally got smart enough to take the camera out of its case, it had a perfectly good battery and a roll of film with 9 exposures used.  In honor of our brilliance, here's a photo from Hans' birthday party.     
   We pumped the locals for  information about the climb (distance, grade, etc.), all of which turned out to be inaccurate.  The proprietor at the Canebreak Cafe showed us his astronomical photos (Hale Bopp comet and whatnot) before sending us on our way.  The pass turned out to be pretty manageable, and was followed by a long downhill back to 2300 feet.  Then flat for 9 hot miles between Inyokern and Ridgecrest.  After hunting down a rare nonsmoking motel vacancy, we landed at the Best Western.  The plan is to rest up for a long haul to Lone Pine tomorrow.  Gotta buy a camera battery so we can start taking pictures.
   So, we're hotelling it for one more night before heading to Bishop tomorrow.    This afternoon, we met a college student named Andrew, who bought us smoothies when we pulled into town.  (Thanks Andrew!)  He bike toured last summer, and felt he had some Karma to pay back.  We gave him a "Bozeman" refrigerator magnet.
   For the first time after several times of passing by it in the dark on the way to Mammoth Mtn. as a kid on family vacation, I got to go in and see it.  We didn't take the auto tour, but nonetheless saw foundations and masonry of some of the administrative buildings.  11,000 Japanese Americans in that place, 8 to each barracks for 3 years.  Lots of Ghosts.  They had only the Sierra Nevadas to give them any visual solace in their natural surroundings.      We saw these spectacular peaks for over 60 miles on our northward ride on 395.  The tailwinds blessed us too, and we sometimes shifted to the highest gear and glided along at 25 mph. Found a darn good campground called Brown's Town about 1/2 mile from downtown.  It's got lawns and big shady cottonwoods, and the small store, showers, laundry, and mini-museum block the campsites from the highway noise.  There are the requisite RV's with their bug lights, flood-lit lanterns and televisions, but they are at least parked on the circumfrence of the grounds with tent sites on the inside.  Also, the quiet hours are enfourced starting at 10pm, wich thankfully meant the loud drunk men and the cover song of "Country Road" they were playing on the boombox were turned off.
   We had a good, hot breakfast in town and walked around.  There's also a great cafe called Kava Coffeehouse that has good espresso and fun decor and gifts.  I wish we had something like that in Bozeman. Right now we're lounging in the city park, wich is also nice, if unsheltered from Main Street & 395 traffic.  I've been wavering between heat and ride induced sleepiness and the need to relax.  I'll hit my stride soon.  I'm really enjoying myself.  Now I'm ready for the expanse and quiet of Nevada desert and Mountains.
   Both Dad G. and Jeff had expressed concern about the sparse services between Benton, CA, and Tonopah, NV -- an 81 mile stretch.  My pre-trip research notes showed a "Lodge and Casino" at the top of Montgomery Pass.  However, none of our "scouts" (who drove portions of our route while returning from our wedding ceremony) saw it while passing through.  Of additional concern was the "number out of service" message we got when we called the phone number. Our backup plan was to wait for nightfall and push all the way to Tonohpah in cooler temps.  However, at the cafe in Benton, the locals said the hotel remained open at Montgomery Pass -- even though the casino and restaurant were closed.  Hopeful, but not entirely convinced, we left Benton in the noon heat, sending some extra water ahead with a man named Don, who was on his way to Phoenix with his wife Cindy and small dog Ce Ce. (Thanks to the 3 of you!) We figured that even if the hotel was closed, we'd have enough food and H2O to camp in the shade of the buildings. The hotel was in fact open, as we learned from hand-written roadside signs as we crested Montgomery Pass.       The rest of the "resort" was closed, but the signs guided us around the back of the casino to the hotel office where we were met by several barking dogs and their master, Kevin. Kevin was a pretty deranged individual, stumbling around shirtless in the empty, weedy parking lot, shouting and talking to the dogs and himself.  He scared us a bit at first, but was friendly and cogent once we approached.  I learned that he was the "security guard" hired to look after the resort while the buildings, land, and gaming/liquor licenses got untangled in probate court.  He is very isolated out there, and his only contact with the world is through a CB radio. At any rate, Kevin rented us a surprisingly clean, comfortable room for the $27 cash we had on hand, rather than the standard $30 fee.  (Thanks Kevin!)  Given our alternatives, we totally lucked out.  Even got to spend the afternoon watching "Cable Guy" on the one channel that came in on the TV -- HBO! Montgomery Pass was certainly a strange place, but worked well for us.
Very empty country from Montgomery Pass here to Tonopah, but we made great time.  10.5 miles downhill in the first half hour, and 66 miles in 4 hours, 20 minutes.    It was a good thing we were fast, because the cinnamon Pop Tart, one energy bar, and one Gu were wearing off quickly in the 11am desert sun.  We had only a Pop Tart for breakfast because we bugged out of the Montgomery Pass Inn by 6:40am (with Kevin and his friends cheering us out of the parking lot. "We rule," according to them.)  We stopped in the middle of the empty desert to see what it was like to holler at the absolute top of our lungs.  Since there was nothing around to reflect the sound, it seemed like we were using normal speaking voices no matter how hard we yelled.    Tonopah appeared on the horizon at the top of a series of hills about 12 miles from the end, which made the last 50 minutes (in a headwind) tough.  It was a huge relief to find a Mexican restaurant for lunch, then a good motel for our stay -- the Jim Butler, named after the man who discovered silver in this area in the early 20th century.  Now Tonopah is a "historic mining town" and there is a museum and a tour route of the former mines. The town is struggling, if the many boarded-up hotels, stores, and gas stations are any indication.  The motel information packet had among its many "local pride" items a couple of articles about the test site of the Stealth Bomber, which was here between 1982 and 1992, and employed over 300 people, which must be a sizeable part of the population.  Luckily, we found this friendly, spacious, air conditioned room in a motel that has hung on since 1979.
  After descending from the hilltop in Tonopah, we fought our first significant headwinds of the trip.  After 30 miles or so, we finally turned to the right and had cross-to-tail wind as we rode up the Big Smoky Valley, a broad valley with 11,000 foot peaks to the east and west.  The place is so expansive that its hard to take photographs that do it justice.      A nice short day -- we stopped in Carvers, a fairly prosperous mining town with a small hotel, store, and cafe -- but not much else.  More afternoon HBO in the air conditioned motel room.
As we set off Tuesday, we were thinking we might camp in the Toiyabes near Kingston, but we arrived in only 2 hours and the wind was blowing hard out of the west.  We decided to use those winds to push across highway 50 for Eureka and take a rest day on Wednesday. We made great time.  We also got bad "Baboon Ass" and made up a song about it.  Sample verse: It's the prickly heat Like your sitting on glass Sore in the posterior We've got Baboon Ass! Despite a challenging climb over Hickison Summit, we pushed the high gear at  25 mph much of the way, and took a desperately needed break at a Highway 50 rest stop -- just shelters and picnic tables.    We sailed along the remaining 30 miles with a bit of uphill into Eureka.  Checking into the Best Western, we met Moe and Betty from Indianapolis.  They took our picture in the parking lot.    Moe and Betty invited us to join them for dinner.  Moe is an Electrical Engineer who spent many years recording demo tapes for bands in his home  studio .  He was very knowledgable about music, and as the restaurant tape loop cycled for the 2nd or 3rd time he shouted, "DAMN YOU KENNY G, YOU'LL BURN IN HELL FOR THIS!"  A memorable line that kept us entertained for many days after.   We also heard about their hobby flying free-flight model gliders.  Very nice folks, and we appreciated their company.
   Eureka is tucked into low lying foothills, sheltered from the wind that blew us there.  The town boomed with silver strikes at the end of the 1800's, with its population growing to 10,000 by 1890.  Now it's not much more than 1 or 2 thousand, but many of its buildings from the turn of the century still stand among some closed up businesses. We found a really nice room at the Best Western, a perfect place for spending a rest day.  As we lounged on the lawn of the former Eureka County High School, some pubescent boys were scrambling across and said, "Hi, where are you from?"  We answered, and they responded, "This place sucks -- I don't recommend it!"  We reassured them that most kids their age in this country feel the same way about their home towns.
   A very very quiet road;  we had about 2 or 3 cars pass us from behind, including a UPS truck that passed again from the other direction.    A horse ran with us for about 2 miles, easily reaching 20 mph I would guess.  Don't know what it was thinking, but it ran with us on one side of the road about 100 yards away, then crossed the road in front of us at a trot.  Once it got far ahead of us, it would stop and keep staring at us, then when we passed start running with us again.  I was a little nervous it would decide to charge or try to mate with our green two-headed creature.  Eventually, it tired out though.  Beautiful chestnut colored, rather thin horse.  It was on a ranch, but we wondered whether it might be wild with its ribs showing and all. We camped at cold creek reservoir, near where the pavement ends on highway 892.    There was a cluster of mobile homes across the highway, used to house employees of the nearby Bald Mountain mine.  A man (whose name we never got) came down to the reservoir to exercise his dog.  He drank beer from his cooler (without offering us any) and gave us a good ribbing about our trip.  The discussion went like this: ===== "What are you doing camped out here?!" "We're travelling through." "On THAT?!" (gesturing to our bike) "Yes." "Why don't you get a JOB?!" ===== And on it went.  He was pretty obnoxious, but it didn't bother us too much.  I guess he had a point.  It was pretty ridiculous for us to be out there camping on a bike.  Before leaving, he asked, "So what are you going to have for dinner tonight, SOUP?!"  Actually, it was macaroni and cheese from a box, but we laughed about it for the rest of the trip.
   Highlights of Cold Creek:  lightning show at dusk, clouds covering the blazing sun, a lovely quiet morning with trout leaping and splashing all over the water's surface to catch bugs. Had cloud cover most of Friday's ride, and about 4 ranching trucks passed us for the entire stretch of dirt road -- almost 5 hours of riding.  Very very quiet and desert-pastoral.    Cattle watched us pass by, and we very carefully rode through one pack of mamas and babies, making sure not to get between cows and their calves.    We arrived in Jiggs by lunchtime, but the lone bar there had only snack food.  The older couple running the place were friendly though.  The husband said when he was a young rancher, they'd drive a herd of cattle the 32 miles to Elko over the course of 3 days.  Made our upcoming 2-3 hours seem speedy by comparison. Lots of roly-poly hills to Elko that wore on us.  The clouds also got thicker, and the brief storm decided to strike just as we finished a last brutal climb in high speed, four lane traffic. The minute we hit Elko's outskirts the obnoxious driving joined forces with the storm and nearly knocked us off the bike. The narrow shoulder on the descent had a rumble strip of course.  We should  have used the drum brake and taken our time, but we felt the urgency to beat the rain and get away from the crazy drivers as soon as possible.  The rain really started coming down and the wind gusted.  We rode to the left of the white line to stay clear of the rumble strip, and an especially moronic driver in a camper honked at us, then passed about 6 inches to our left.  With the wind blowing hard from the left, the side draft from the camper sucked us way out into the travel lane.  I put a curse on the driver of that truck:  the propane tank will be exploding and the holding tank bursting open about 50 miles out of Elko -- i.e. in the middle of NOWHERE. After we escaped that catastrophe, we were just reaching the bottom of the hill, getting pelted with rain, when a big gust of wind blew across the road.  I saw it coming from a sandy hill to the left of us, blowing every grain of dirt from the hill and about to pick us up and off the road.  Luckily the wind was not blowing from the other side, because that gale sent us sailing 6 feet over, but luckily away from traffic.  Dan finessed it -- we went over the rumble strip, but we managed not to skid off the 6 inches of asphalt and into the pebbles and sand , where we would definitely have gone down at 25+ mph. We followed a motorcyclist into a car wash bay, and waited about 30 seconds for the storm to end, praising the skies we weren't hurt, and laughing at our filthy, sandblasted bodies.   
After a great sleep in the motel, we set off on what developed into one of the best days of riding so far.  First, however, we took our picture in front of a bunch of motorcycles, just to show how well we fit in with the bike rally that was happening in Elko that weekend.      The day's ride started with a 9-mile climb to Adobe Summit.     It then continued up rolling hills up to Wild Horse Reservoir, on the divide separating the Humboldt and Owyhee/Jarbidge river drainages.  Lots of climbing, but good tailwinds pushed us along.      We made a brief stop at a bar to pick up supplies for cocktail hour in camp later.  After a twisty ride through the Owyhee River Canyon, we arrived at a lovely forest service campground -- a good one to remember in the future.      As a bonus, we can coast 8 or so miles into Mountain City for a hot breakfast in the morning.  Life is good.
   We gorged ourselves on microwave breakfast burritos, and things went pretty well from there.  However, it became clear that I'd made a mistake in my mileage calculations.  The trip to Bruneau was more like 100 miles instead of the 70-80  we'd planned on.  Everything went fine until the last 15 miles or so, when we hit strong, hot headwinds from the north.  The 90+ degree heat made the valley a real blast furnace.  What a contrast with the start of our day in the canyon with all of our warm weather gear on and temps in the 40's. We hunkered down as the last of 62 (Marilyn counted) motorcycle riders from Elko roared by.  About 2 miles from town, on a deceptive uphill into the wind, there was additional insult to our already considerable injury.  I got stung by a bee -- ouch! At the supermarket in Bruneau, we learned that our intended campsite at Bruneau Dunes was 10+ miles away, with considerable climbing in hot wind.  NO WAY. Fortunately, Boyd Campbell came to our rescue. (Thanks Boyd!)  He drove me around town (more or less around the block) in his pickup, and showed me the town's cafe, bar, and (most importantly) park!.  A small patch of shady grass off the highway where we could pitch our tent for the night.  We sat and waited until the Junior Rodeo awards ceremony broke up (good turnout).    Then we settled in for the night.     Surely more adventure tomorrow.
After a great breakfast in Mountain Home, we finally bought an Idaho map at Albertson's.  Dan asked about the terrain from there to Fairfield. On the map, there was a suspicious kink in the road, but no pass or elevation indicated.  The woman at the cash register said there were "a few gentle hills" but nothing too bad. We cursed that woman the entire 3800 feet and 30 miles of climbing to Cat Creek Summit, which we renamed "Crackpipe Summit" in honor of that woman's totally deluded, brain-blown, numbskull idea of "a few gentle  hills!"  The last bit to Crackpipe Summit was a mile of 9% grade and it bumped our total climbing for the day (including the hills out of Bruneau) over 5000 feet.    That woman was friendly enough, but (warning, emotional outburst ahead) JEEZ TAKE A LOOK AROUND YOU, PAY ATTENTION, KNOW YOUR WORLD OR AT LEAST THE PLACE WHERE YOU LIVE FOR THE LOVE OF GOD!!!!! So, that was a brutal day, not knowing we were in for the longest climb of the trip.  On the upside, the ride was beautiful: green flowering hills, creeks and rivers, and when we finally, finally hit the flats, rolling agricultural fields. and the Boulder Mountains. We pulled into the first motel we saw in Fairfield, and there was a group of 19 cyclists from the Seattle area.  They call themselves the Goosebumps, and they were supporting themselves with 2 vans (taking turns driving) on a 7-day loop in Idaho.  They welcomed us and empathised with our travelling stories and the ignorance/boneheadedness of that woman that took us over our limit of belief and patience.  (What, did you think the emotional outburst was over?) We had dinner with the crowd of them -- all really friendly and fun people.  We will be sharing the road with them for a few days, through Ketchum to Stanley.
   That may have just been a polite way of saying, "Hey dumbass, are you trying to get yourself killed out here on the highway?"  But we nevertheless appreciated the tip, and enjoyed the ride into Ketchum for a much-needed rest day.

     We slowly chugged our way up to 8701 foot Galena Summit -- our high point for the whole trip.    The Seattle Goosebumps gang was at the overlook on the other side.  They generously offered their turkey sandwich makings, bananas, broccoli and dip, Fritos, and M+M's among their huge lunch spread.  (Thanks Goosebumps!)    The Salmon River lay below us, and a 300 year old White Pine stood guard at the rest stop.      The Goosebumps went back down the summit to climb up again.  But we two with our TUB (or bike:  "The Ultimate Behemoth") and our BOB (our trailer: "Beast of Burden") could not and would not.  We headed down the other side to Redfish Lake.    We found a great campsite -- a walk-in, tents only loop in Point Campground.  At one end of Redfish Lake are some spectacular snow-capped Sawtooth peaks.  We gazed on them over our G+T's and dinners at the lodge restaurant.  A great place with nice beaches -- must be a zoo on weekends, but great for kids.
   Stopped for coffee in Stanley, and parted ways with the Goosebumps.  We took in more gorgeous scenery along the Salmon, and stopped for lunch in the small park in Clayton.    Finished the day in a motel room at the northern edge of this town fringed with red and beige and cream striped cliffs.
We had a delicious lunch in Salmon and bought some more camping food before taking to the road again on the highway south.  There were lots of cattle and horses to greet along the way, but we were getting tired and the road was flat and strait -- hence, rough on the butt.  Actually the road had a visually imperceptible rise, so the 20 miles to Tendoy and the turnoff for the dirt road to Lemhi pass took longer than I thought -- or seemed to anyway. After a Hostess (cupcakes for me, apple pie for Dan) and cold drink break at the little store in Tendoy, we got on the bumpy but thankfully short dirt road to our BLM campsite.      Agency Creek babbles just a few yards from our tent on this small campground. Tomorrow it is 8 or so miles and 2000+ feet to Lemhi Pass, but on a quiet dirt road and in lovely scenery.
   After that, the climbing got more serious.  There were several sections that were just too steep to pedal a loaded bike -- at least not without a gear lower than our 30x34 creeper.      At any rate, it was only a little bit slower to get off and push.  So, we stubbornly turned down a BLM employee's offer to drive some of our gear to the top, and we pressed on, alternating pedaling and walking.  I swear the last several hundred yards were over 20% grade -- super steep.  At 7.5 miles, we reached the top and officially entered Montana!      Spent some time looking at historical markers with a few Lewis and Clark buffs who'd driven up -- including one who gave us cold Dr. Peppers from his cooler (thanks, stranger).        After we left, we descended 13 miles on bumpy but beautiful dirt roads.    Next came a 20 mile cruise to Clark Canyon reservoir with tailwinds most of the way.  The same wind pushed us the final 17 miles into Dillon.  Hot showers and sound sleep at the Best Western -- ahh.
   After that, we literally had smooth sailing.  The wind blew us to Whitehall, then through the Jefferson River Canyon to Lewis and Clark Caverns for our final night out.      We're starting to look forward to getting a good lickin' from Genki (our dog).  Should be about 55 miles to Bozeman.  See you there!
We also had incredible good luck from a mechanical standpoint.  Over nearly 1400 miles, our biggest problems were cable stretch and chain grit -- not even a flat tire!  Here's our reliable machine loaded up for the last leg of our trip.    Show links to this Hide links to this      We rode the "back way" to Three Forks through Willow Creek    At the Three Forks Cafe, two old timers joined us at our table, and shared conversation and coffee.  It was reasurring to come home to such local friendliness after travelling through so many other places.  We'd made an earlier pact to photograph the first sign that told the mileage to Bozeman.  Riding secondary roads, it came later than we expected, but come it did.    Our friend Maxwell met us on Springhill road as we approached town, and escorted us the final few miles to our house.    Upon arrival, we saw first hand the chaos of the remodel/addition that got underway while we were out of the house for a month.  Things are a bit "rustic" around here at the moment, but we're happy to be back, sharing our adventure with friends and family.   





  For those not aware of some of my more eccentric quirks, I used to choose my travel destinations based on what letter of the alphabet the country started with.  Somehow, a long time ago, I got into a discussion with somebody about travelling, and we realized that I had been to countries from about twenty letters of the alphabet.  I decided to finish the alphabet, and started choosing destinations based on the alphabet.  At the time, I was getting close to finishing, and only needed to visit K,Q, and Z.  Time was running out, as Zaire had recently changed to the Congo.  There were only two countries left that started with Z, one with Q, and a handful with K.  There was also a solar eclipse that would sweep through South Africa, including Zambia, Zimbabwe, and Mozambique.  That sealed my decision, and I booked myself a two month vacation that would go to Kenya, Malawi, either Zambia or Zimbabwe, and if possible, Mozambique.  I would cover off K,Z and a solar eclipse.  What other reason do you need? 
This was a solo trip, and my first one of any great length.  I started out by reading every guidebook I could find on the region to determine whether it was safe to cycle, if the roads were good, and if there was anything to see along the way.  I also consulted the web to get information on the eclipse, including weather conditions, the eclipse path, and what to do about photographing it. Using the eclipse path as my final objective, I looked at all the airports within a few weeks riding distance.  Those with somewhat spotty reputations were dropped, and I finally settled on landing in Lilongwe, Malawi.  As an added bonus, I arranged a one week stopover in Kenya.  It was all coming together. The plan, if you could call it that, would be to fly from Vancouver to Amsterdam, spend a day there and then fly out to Nairobi that evening.  I would stay one week in Kenya, and then fly out to Lilongwe, where I would have about seven weeks to somehow ride a bike to a convenient viewing point along the total eclipse line, and visit a country starting with the letter 'Z'.  Then I would head home.   For Kenya, I decided to splurge and go on a safari.  I found a place in Nairobi called 'Bike Treks', that does supported bike tours, as well as regular safaris.  I got in contact with them via e-mail, and made arrangements to tag along with a group that was leaving the day I would arrive.  Getting gear was next.  The sub Saharan part of Africa was one of the poorest regions in the world, which meant it would be cheap to travel in.  There wouldn't be any need to camp, but there were a few parks that I might need a tent.     So, I would cycle with the occasional night in a tent, and rely on restaurants for hot food.  Originally, I planned to take a bike on the plane, but decided against it because I didn't want to pack and unpack it in Nairobi, one of the more dangerous cities around. As well, I learned it was possible to buy bicycles in Malawi.  It didn't seem worth the hassle. I picked up a pair of Arkel 54l expedition panniers, a waterproof handlebar bag, and a frame bag.  These would have to carry all my gear.   Eventually, I filled them up with the following equipment: Allen keys  Headset wrench   13/15 mm cone wrench   16/17 mm cone wrench   chain break   small crescent wrench   combination presta/shraeder   pump patch kit (with 40 patches)   spare shifter and brake cables   tire irons  'universal'  spoke wrench   white duct tape (useful for making labels, too!)  bungee cords   Leatherman wave two t shirts  gortex jacket  silk shirt  convertible long pants/shorts quick  dry shorts  5 pairs underwear and socks  camera gear (OM-2, 28-200 Tamron zoom, doubler, 24 mm prime, Pentax WR-90, and 35 rolls of film)  minidisc recorder  tent/groundsheetthermarest  mosquito net  hydration pack  reading material  journal  two dozen power bars  plastic spoon and fork  medical kit toiletries  water treatment drops  compass  small luggage locks  padlock  other things that I am unable to remember right now.
   I arrived in Amsterdam in the morning, and took the train from Schipol airport to the central station.  The airport is only a short fifteen minute train ride away from the center, making it one of the better places to have a layover.      I had not been in Amsterdam for ten years, and marvelled at how clean the city had become.  Renovations were going on everywhere, and the streets looked much cleaner than I remembered them to be.  However, Amsterdam still remains one of the most deceivingly difficult places to navigate.  It is laid out in a horseshoe pattern, with canals all over the place to further confuse and disorient the newcomer. I spent the greater part of the morning trying to walk to the Rijksmuseum, where you can find the works of Vincent Van Gogh, and other Dutch artists.  After several wrong turns, I finally arrived at the museum, only to find huge lineups and an expensive entry fee.  It seemed a bit extravagant to go in, as the museum entrance fee was roughly equal to three days living expenses in Malawi.  Instead, I spent the rest of the afternoon hanging out in the park beside the Rijksmuseum.  Amsterdam is a great place for just doing nothing.      That evening, I flew to Nairobi on Air Kenya.  All things considered, it wasn't nearly as bad as I was expecting.  However, the meal portions were probably suggested by somebody from Weight Watchers.  I recommend bringing extra food. 
Masai Mara National Park is the place where all documentary crews go.  It is literally brimming with wildlife, and the destination of the famous wildebeest migration in July.  Like usual, I was there at the wrong time.  It was May, and the wet season had just ended.  At that time, the park was still green, but quickly turning yellow as the land dried out.  There was still lots of underbrush, so spotting smaller animals was next to impossible, but it was still easy to see the larger ones.    I had a fantastic time during the five days, taking bike rides and going on walks in the area outside the park, and going on game rides inside the park.  The guides spoke reasonably good English, and were very competent.  As this company caters to cyclists, the food was good, and plentiful.  They fed me enough to keep me full, which is an accomplishment in itself.      After the safari finished, I hired the guide/driver for a day of sightseeing in Nairobi as well.  Nairobi National Park is just outside the city, and one of the better spots to see rhinoceros.  We were very lucky, and spotted rhinos twice while in the park.   Afterwards, we went to the Carnivore restaurant, where you can eat many of the animals that you just photographed.  Some people think it is tacky, but eating beef in Africa is far more damaging environmentally than eating the local species that are much better adapted to the environment.  Ranting aside, crocodile really does taste like chicken! 
Lilongwe was only mildly dangerous compared to other African cities.  However, car jackings were not uncommon, and certain stretches of road were considered dangerous to walk along.  I heard a report that a Japanese tourist was mugged in broad daylight while crossing a small, very busy bridge into town and that somebody had been recently murdered at night just outside the guesthouse.   Crime aside, I still needed to buy a bicycle, and headed off to a section of seedy looking shops.  I was in  the automotive section of the city, and there wasn't a bicycle store in sight.  However, one of the store owners knew where I could find a bike, and proceeded to call the shop to enquire about prices, and then give me instructions on how to get there.  He was very helpful, and eased my worries and paranoia. I found the bicycle store, and took a look at a few of the bikes.  Most were Indian made one speeds, but there were a few Taiwanese rigid frame bikes that would be suitable.  I left to see if there was any other stores that had similar bikes.   There wasn't.  It was the only store in the city that I could find that sold mountain bikes of reasonable quality.  This wouldn't make negotiating a price any easier.   I had other things to do as well.  Since I now knew there was a suitable bike, it was time to plot a suitable route.  My original intention had been to fly up north, and ride down to Zambia, visit a national park, and then head to Zimbabwe, cross into Mozambique for the eclipse, and then ride back to Lilongwe and head home. This plan failed miserably, and I ended up doing something completely different.  There were far too many hurdles.  First off, I tried to buy a flight ticket to the north, but the flight I wanted had been cancelled.   They were quite willing to sell me a ticket, but I would be unable to book any date.   Second, the political situation in Zimbabwe was getting increasingly unstable and could be potentially dangerous to ride through.  Finally, it would take a week to get a visa for Mozambique, and I really didn't want to spend the next week in a somewhat dirty city with absolutely nothing to see or do. So, another plan was needed.  Meanwhile, I met two Australian travellers at the guesthouse. They not only gave me recommendations on where to go and what to see in Malawi, but more importantly, showed me where to find the best chicken biryani in the city.  This biryani was a special recipe, and had to be ordered a day in advance.  All three of us ate there every day, no doubt contributing to a new wing in the restaurant owner's home.      Apart from food, the Australians had been in Malawi for six weeks and had plenty of good suggestions on where to go.  With this in mind, I made a plan that not only could work, but one that I actually followed.  Well, mostly.  Nothing ever falls together exactly as planned. I would ride south to Mulanje, via Blantyre and Dedza.  Then, I would head back north to Lake Malawi, and then ride back through Lilongwe, and make a beeline for Lusaka.  From outside Lusaka, I would see the eclipse, and then head back to Chipata, stop at the national park, and then go back to Lilongwe and head home.   Getting everything set took three days.  With the new plan, there was now no need to get visas and I could leave as soon as I had wheels.  Getting a bike and appropriate gear was all that was left.  The day before I departed, I spent an hour trying to bargain down the price of a 21 speed, aluminum frame mountain bike.  The owner knew he had me, and wouldn't budge on price.  He did bring in a mechanic to tune it up, and threw in a few spare spokes and inner tubes.      That evening, I put some puncture prevention strips in the wheels and checked to see how everything fit.  It would work!  Even better, I jokingly mentioned to the others at the guesthouse that I was selling the bike.  An aid worker who was in town that week heard me, and said she would buy the bike from me.  She would pick it up at the guesthouse when I returned in six weeks. Armed with a bike, two dozen power bars, a kilogram of chocolate, and a chicken biryani, I was ready to hit the road! 
   The road was smooth and had a good shoulder.  Within an hour of riding, it started getting hilly, hot and sunny.  However, there was little traffic to cause me grief.  I wore myself out taking on hills too quickly, and had to stop several times for water, chocolate, and of course, chicken biryani.   By one, I was 65 km further, hot, and tired.  A convenient bottle store appeared, and I stopped to get a cold drink.  Just as I finished what seemed like the world's smallest Fanta, a vein in my nose burst.  While I sat there trying to get my nose to stop bleeding in the heat, a South African mining engineer stopped and offered me a lift.   I gratefully accepted, and rode the last 20 km in the back of his truck.  He dropped me off at the turnoff to Dedza, and I pedalled the remaining kilometer into town.  Dedza wasn't a very big place, and I couldn't really figure out why it was where it was, and how it survived economically.  This was the first of many inexplicable towns that I rode through.  Despite its size, there was one somewhat questionable guesthouse which had a cheap room where I could store my bike. The guesthouse restaurant served up some fish and rice for me.  After the chicken biryanis I'd been eating for the last few days, the meal was pretty dull and unimaginative.  I had no desire to eat the ubiquitous nsima, expecting there to be plenty of opportunity to eat it in the future. 
   I was planning to stay at an agricultural station about 10 km before Ntcheu.  However, the police, of all people, gave me the wrong directions to the turnoff, and I rode several kilometers downhill by the time I realized there was a mistake.  As it was too much work to turn around and start riding uphill, I continued to Ntcheu in the hope that there would be somewhere to stay there. When I arrived in Ntcheu, it was mid afternoon.  Ntcheu was bigger than Dedza, in the same way that an ant is bigger than  a flea.  Surprisingly enough, there was a small rest house, and restaurant.  There wasn't else much to the town, except for a local soccer (football) game that was happening down the street.   After the game finished, there was little to do except eat.  The local restaurant had only nsima.  It isn't easy to describe nsima.  It is essentially corn flour that is boiled and formed into palm size balls.  Nsima is usually served with some sort of meat and sauce, fried vegetables, and occasionally eggs.  You break/pull a bite size piece off of the ball, and roll it into whatever sauce is available.   All I can say about eating nsima is that it is an acquired taste that I never acquired, and the thought of eating it for three months was one of the reasons that I decided to go to India on the next trip.      After dinner, I was really tired and tried to write in my journal, before turning in.  The journal entry read 'I am currently in Ntcheu, in a 100 kwacha single. Here is peaceful, but not like times where you punch them and they faint.  So the last standing gets very rich.  Too tired to write anym...'  What was I thinking about?  Only the shadow knows, now. 
  It was downhill, and easy for the first few hours.  However, as the altitude dropped, and the sun rose, the temperature became increasingly uncomfortable.  I was descending into the Shire valley.  This was the hottest part of Malawi, and a bit of trivia that I only found out after it was too late.   By  eleven, it was getting around 32C.  There were some clouds casting shade onto the road, and I spent some time darting between cloud shadows, trying to maximize shade time.  Apart from the occasional cloud, there was no shade anywhere, as most of the trees by the roadside had been chopped down for wood, or to make fields.  My bottom bracket was starting to act up.  I would have to get it adjusted in Blantyre. The next three hours were spent riding short distances, collapsing, eating sugary snacks, and drinking large quantities of water.  Although not much progress was made,  I did break my personal best for most sugar eaten in one day. The heat of the day had passed by mid afternoon, only to be replaced by a more hills.  Now that I was on the other side of the Shire river, the land once again rose, this time to the plateau where Blantyre was situated.  I could feel my legs getting more tired on each stroke.    Somewhere around 4:30, I rode into Lirangwe, the last 'major' settlement before Blantyre.  There was a sign for a guesthouse, which probably hadn't had a guest for years.  The room was small, dirty, lacking a mosquito net or fan.  The toilet and shower were outside, and consisted of two rooms.  The toilet was room with a hole in the middle, and the shower was a room with a bucket of water and a piece of tin corrugation  for a door.   But, the price was right, at only 60 k. As I was the first guest to come by in some time, the owner said she would cook my dinner.  We haggled over price and content, and eventually settled on goat meat with rice.  I was very happy not to be subjected to nsima.  With no dining room, I ate on the steps in the back yard, with a view of  a large pile of corn husks and junk.  Not exactly high living, but good enough for me.  My legs were now running out of energy, and I was asleep within minutes of finishing dinner.   
The heat was stripping what little strength remained in my legs.  It was uphill, with little, if any shade on the road.  Then, I came across a bottle store selling cold drinks.  I had a new system!  Stop at the bottle store, drink something cold, wait until I cooled down, and then ride to the next bottle store.  You don't get far fast, but at least you eventually get there. Three and a half hours  and 15 km later, I wheeled into Blantyre, and found the campsite. At the point of exhaustion, I collapsed on the couch at the reception desk, and could not move for half an hour.  When the feeling returned to my legs,  and my eyes could once again focus, I noticed that I was in a place with toilet paper, and a restaurant that did not list nsima on the menu.  I was back in the tourist part of town.    This was not necessarily a bad thing, even for somebody as tourist averse as myself.  One of the bar staff found me a mechanic who adjusted my bottom bracket for 50 k, and I met several other travellers who gave me valuable information on Mt. Mulanje.    Mt. Mulanje was a huge rock massif, about 100 km south of Blantyre.  It was a nature reserve, and popular for really long ( three-four days) walks.  Several travellers had said it was worth going to, but I had no camping gear, and a bicycle.  According to two Americans,  it would be possible if I got a suitable hiking pack, and found somewhere to stash the bike.  There were huts, and a porter could provide cooking gear. A side note about Americans.  As a Canadian, I have been  culturally ingrained to believe in the inherent superiority of Canadians  over Americans in both international relations, and hockey.  We all have stereotypical images, and the ugly American is one of them.  That being said, I did not meet one ugly American the entire time I was in Africa,  and found those that I did meet to be really great, open minded, individuals.  Stereotypes! Pah!  Sure, there are some ugly Americans out there, but that's not every American.  And the most obnoxious person I ever met happened to be from Canada, and from my home town, Vancouver (well, Surrey but close enough).  I'm still trying to come to terms with that one. As for the rest of the day?  I met the campsite manager, who was from Victoria, the city I attended university.  He had been working earlier in Zimbabwe, and told me that the Canadian ambassador had just been  beaten by a few of Mugabe's underlings.  This prompted the Canadian government to sever all diplomatic ties with Zimbabwe, and pull out all economic aid.  Suddenly, I was much happier about not being anywhere near Zimbabwe.  It would be Zambia for the letter Z, or nothing. 
Apart from email, and pack buying, there wasn't much in Blantyre to attract the regular tourist.  There was, however, a few things to distract somebody like myself.  First, there was a Nando's Chicken.  This is a South African chain that chars chicken to perfection.  It was almost the same price as back home, but a welcome break from the less than culinary delights I'd been eating for the last few days.   In what may be one of the strangest juxtapositions of eating I have ever seen, I also found a combination hardware store/Indian take out restaurant.   The food was very good, and you could get a bag of plaster with your samosas.  So, if you ever have an urge to have a curry, and do some plumbing, I know the place to go... 
After getting  out of the city, the ride to Mt. Mulanje was great.  The M-3 passed through countless, bright green tea plantations, and rolling hills.  Today was much easier than previous days.  It was a net drop in elevation from Blantyre to Mulanje, and I was finally adjusting to the heat.  To top it off, I had plenty of company along the way.  Early in the day, a freshly graduated teenager rode beside me and struck up a conversation.  He was on his way to a job interview for the tourism office of Malawi.  We chatted and rode down the M-3, until he reached the turnoff to the tourism office.    About  five km later, I was joined by Noah, a junk salesman.  He was on his way to visit a friend about 20 km away.  He developed bike trouble soon after, and we stopped to fix the problem.  It was more serious than anything I could fix, and we walked the bike to the next town in search of a bike mechanic. Fortunately, bike mechanics are everywhere in Malawi, and Noah soon had a working bike.  One thing I noticed about Malawi was the complete absence of accessible information. Newspapers were controlled by whoever was in power, as was local television.  The internet was a luxury out of reach to the majority of the people.   Noah was hungry for any news about the outside world and I did my best to inform him of the latest events.        We rode together for an hour, when he spotted his friend waiting for him on the side of the road.  (How does anything get done with such poor communications?)  After he met his friend, I rode on my own for about fifteen minutes.  Then, I was passed by two men on bicycles.  They were two fishmongers on their way to Chipitali and  rode with me the rest of the way.  They were in fantastic shape, and I could barely keep up with them, even though I was drafting them in a headwind, and they both were carrying full loads of fish.      Exhausted, but trying to pretend that I wasn't, we arrived in Chipitali, a small town only a few kilometers from the forestry office.  I stayed in Chipitali that evening, and bought some last minute supplies for  trekking on Mt. Mulanje.  Tomorrow, I would be on the mountain, and could hardly wait.   
   While it is a pretty poor place for biking, the Mulanje massif is a fantastic place to hike.  I could go on and on about walking on Mulanje, but this is supposed to be about cycling and not hiking.  I'll keep it brief.    There is beautiful scenery on the plateau, and fantastic views of Malawi and Mozambique. There are also huts strategically placed on the massif, making it easy to stay for longer than a day.  For my trek, I opted to be a bourgeois tourist, and hired a porter through the forestry office.      Francis was my porter.  He was going to trade school to be a mechanic, but had to drop out because of a shortage of funds.  This was my first real exposure to how difficult life was in Malawi.  Both his father and sister had passed away (I didn't ask further, but believe it was probably AIDS) and he barely got enough work as a porter to get a job once or twice in a year.      It took  three days to walk across the massif.  The walk was a welcome change from cycling, and I was enjoying the scenery immensely.  The flora changed from pine and cedar forest on the slopes, to grassland and scrub on the plateau.  The peaks were stripped bare of vegetation but offered great views of the surrounding countryside.    There were several huts to stay at en route, and these were mostly empty.  It was chilly at night, even inside the huts, and I was glad to have brought some warm clothing and a sleeping bag.    Francis usually cooked with the hut caretaker, wisely leaving me to eat my own cooking.      On the last day, he asked me for help.  I was in a bind.  Should I give him a handout, or just say I couldn't help him?  I didn't want to leave him in the cold, nor did I want to make him a beggar.It was a tough call, because he was a very bright person in a bad set of circumstances.  I pondered the situation all evening. 
  After getting to the main road, we walked ten kilometers to Phalombe, found a rest house, stashed my bag there, and hitched a ride back to the forestry office.  For some reason, everyone  turned and stared at us when we passed.  This might have been plausible if they could see me coming, but I was sitting at the back of a truck that had no distinguishing features, and probably drove that road  several times a day.  Do Malawians have some sort of Mzungu (means 'white man') sense?  It's one of those travel mysteries that I will probably never figure out.  . After we got back to the forestry office, I fetched my bike, and we went to find Francis' friend.  It was no problem to borrow the bike,  and we rode out to Phalombe.  Although we were on a dirt road, the  ride took much less time than I expected, and we arrived with an hour of daylight to spare.      We went to the resthouse, cleaned up, had a meal,  and headed into 'downtown' Phalombe to meet some of Francis' friends at a shake shake bar.  'Shake Shake bar' is the local term for a watering hole that serves traditional beer.  This beer, if you can call it that, was pretty horrible tasting.  It was like drinking half fermented malt water.  After one sip, I didn't even want to try acquiring a taste for it.  The rest of the evening was spent talking with Francis' progressively more inebriated friends, until the bar closed and it was time to get some rest.   
  By the time we got to Zomba, the sky had changed from sun to rain.  It was a welcome change to have a bit of cooler weather, but the rain only fell for a few minutes.  There certainly was not enough to change the drought that Malawi had been in for the last two years, but it did wet down the roads.   The  no longer dusty town of Zomba had a few banks, a large market, and not much else.   Though it took some searching at several nsima only restaurants, we had a last lunch together of chicken and rice.  After lunch, it was time to say goodbye.  Francis went to the market to find some shoes, and I headed out to Machinga.  I felt a bit strange to be on my own again, but glad to be heading north.   Machinga was another 25 km away, but the air was cool, and I coasted down the road. By the time I arrived in Machinga, it was nearly sunset.  I was in yet another tiny transit town.  Built around the crossroads, Machinga  had a few rest houses, and three restaurants.  I was hungry, and went to find some rice and meat.  At the first restaurant, the waitress said they had nsima but no rice.  At the second and third restaurants, they said the same thing.  At this  point, I gave up. It was nsima or starvation.  I ordered some nsima, and told the waitress to make it a large order because I was very hungry.  Of course, I forgot how much I despised the stuff, and regretted making the order when I saw the full platter of nsima arrive at the table.  My mother always told me to finish everything on my plate, and I did, though slowly and unwillingly.  It must have taken some time to eat, as they closed and shuttered the restaurant as soon as I left.  Or maybe they were trying to tell me something. 
After crossing the Shire river, I rode along the highway until I arrived at the Lirongwe turnoff.  This was another town that sprouted up solely because there happened to be an intersection of two roads.  At the turnoff, I bought some chicken and fried potatoes and settled down for a quick and greasy lunch.   Once lunch was over, I continued along the turnoff.  It led onto a  progressively worsening dirt road, that had some questionable sections where it became hard to distinguish the road from the adjacent fields.  About halfway down the road, I came across a derelict bridge and a small river.  The bridge looked less than sturdy, and the river looked quite shallow.  Fortunately, just as I was evaluating how deep it might be, a pickup came by, and gave me a ride across in the back.  The pickup dropped me off a few kilometers later.  After straightening up the bike, I rode along the now very questionable looking dirt road to the park entrance.  There was nobody at the gate, but eventually sombody came by to take my park entrance fee.  The park warden also warned me about elephants in the forest between the gate and the boat jetty.   I rode somewhat uneasily through the kilometer of dense forest, but arrived at the jetty intact and untrampled.  After a few minutes, a boat arrived to ferry myself and several park employees to the other side.  The ride across the Shire river was beautiful and all too short.  I dreamily watched some kingfishers fly by as we approached the jetty. We landed and unloaded at the camp jetty.  Even though we had only crossed the river, it may as well have been a different world.  Suddenly, I was out of Africa, and into some sort of weird tourist pipe dream.  Gone were the nsima serving restaurants and grotty pit toilets, to be replaced with a western buffet, and perhaps the finest bathroom in Sub-Saharan Africa.  Sadly, with western amenities come western prices.  It cost $8 USD for camping, which was roughly what I might spend for one week in a cheap transit hotel.  Price aside, it was a welcome break.      The staff seemed both relieved and disappointed when I said I wanted to camp, and not stay in a cabin.  The cabins had been fully booked, but my choice of sleeping arrangements signalled to them that I was probably a bad tipper.  Despite the potential lack of gratuities, a park worker showed me to the campsite, and gave me a quick tour of the facilities. After setting up my tent, and finding a place to stash my food from monkeys, I took a walk around the tourist camps.  About 50 m east of my tent, there was a sign warning not to proceed further without an escort.   To the west was the Shire river and the cabin compound.  Although a sign said that only cabin guests were allowed into the compound, I snuck in, just to see how the better half lives.   A pack of monkeys already had the same idea, and were lounging about on the deck chairs.  Soon, the paying guests arrived, scattering the monkeys and myself.  With almost nowhere else to go in the strip of no man's land that they called a camp site, I headed back to my tent.  Monkeys were also lounging about my tent, and ran for the trees when I arrived.  With nothing to eat in my tent, there was no reason for them to linger.  I do not want to think of what state my gear would have been left in had I kept food in the tent.      Soon after, it was time to go on the afternoon game drive.  I headed to the parking lot and got into one of those many seated safari trucks that you see in the glossy brochures.  There were several people in my truck already, and I quickly learned that I was surrounded by a group of Southern Baptist missionaries.  Despite my apprehension about spending the next two hours with a bunch of religious zealots, the Baptists turned out to be a good bunch of people, even if they did try to convert me a few times.      As for the game drive, Liwonde National Park was much more picturesque than the national parks in Kenya, but somewhat lacking in exotic wildlife.   We drove through scrubland dotted with baobab, and then headed to the Shire river to watch the sun set with the hippos and crocodiles, and the Southern Baptists.   That night, I woke to the sound of scraping outside my tent.  It sounded like somebody was shoveling gravel nearby, which got me curious.  Who would want to be shoveling dirt in the dark?  When I took a peek out of my tent, I saw a hippo feeding about 10 m away.  In Africa, hippos are the most dangerous animals to man, and can easily trample someone to death if panicked.  With that thought,  I zipped up the tent, and hoped that it did not resemble a giant vegetable in the dark.  Perhaps green was the wrong colour to choose for a tent. 
        The buffet was excellent, and a fine substitute for peanut butter sandwiches.  I loaded up on moussaka, bread, kebabs, and whatever else happened to be within reach of my grubby paws.  Chuck and Lonnie seemed very amused at how much food I could put away.  Bloated and content, we went back to their cabin to discuss the finer points of life and religion.  They were great guys, and replenished my severely depleted supply of snacks with their surplus candy.   By three, I was not feeling well, and went to my tent for a rest.  I was to go on a game drive a bit later, and wanted to be conscious for it.  An hour later, I felt a bit better and headed out into the park on another game drive.  I did not see much, and started feeling ill.  By the time we returned, I felt like vomiting, and almost did.  Montezuma reared his ugly head soon after, and I became well acquainted with the fine bathrooms at the campsite.  Fortunately, there were no hippos in the campsite that evening. 
  We walked for an hour through scrubland and clumps of baobabs, but saw little wildlife except for the occasional antelope and warthog.  Even so, the walk was over far too soon and it was time for me to get my gear together and get back on the road. It took me nearly two hours to pack up.  I was feeling ill and feverish, and did not really want to leave, but did anyhow.  I thought it best to stop at Ulongwe for some rest.  After getting a boat across the river, I rode back along the questionable dirt track/road to arrive at the questionable bridge crossing.  This time, a teenager helped me carry my stuff across the two or three remaining planks on the bridge.  He was really friendly, but I was feeling too ill to carry a conversation.   We rode back slowly, through densely packed farms and houses.  While riding past a school, I was spotted by  some school kids, who ran up to the road side and chanted 'Mzungu! Mzungu!'  They lined up on the side of the road, smiling and slapping my hand as we passed.  This wouldn't be the first time I would be mistaken for royalty in these parts. In Ulongwe, I found a cheap resthouse, collapsed into my room, and spent most of the day sleeping.  I was so tired that I barely noticed the  resthouse doubled as a night time drinking hole.  My stomach had settled by this point, but I thought it best to skip eating for the rest of the day.  Evening after a four hour nap in the afternoon, I was still barely conscious, and slept soundly the rest of the night. 
I headed off along a winding road that passed between Lake Malombe and adjoining hills.  After a few clicks, my legs started to fatigue, and I could feel symptoms of dehydration.  Fortunately, it was early and cool, and easy to ride along the mostly flat road.    I made great time, and I arrived at 9:30 AM, only three hours and change later.  Mangochi was a huge disappointment.  My guide book described Mangochi as a good spot to visit, and full of character.  Relative to any transit town, or big city slum, Mangochi did have some character, but not nearly enough to warrant an overnight stay, or a detour for that matter.    With nothing to see or do for the rest of the day, I had plenty of time to look for a bike mechanic.  My chain rings were coming out of alignment, and the largest ring made disturbing grinding noises on each revolution.  The others would not be far behind if I did not do something about it soon. Sadly, every book on mountain bike repairs had the same recommendation for making a chain ring adjustment.  Each one suggested to get a mechanic to fix it.  This was not going to be too helpful here.  Most mechanics in Malawi knew how to fix Indian bikes, but had little experience with the more complicated mountain bikes.  I would have to choose a mechanic carefully.   I rode to the market, and circled the mechanics section until I spotted a stall with a mountain bike in it.  This seemed to be the best way to handle it. I asked the mechanic if he could true the chain rings, and he said it would be no problem.  Like an idiot, I believed him.  He and his friend then proceeded to bend the teeth of the chain ring with a set of pliers.  At first, I thought they did things differently, and this approach was the standard practice.  When I took it for a test spin, it still rubbed, and I knew that this was not the way to true chain rings.      Back at the mechanic shop,  they seemed convinced they could fix it, and started trying to bend the front derailleur.  Seeing this, I quickly told them it was not as bad as I thought, and peeled the bike out of their hands before they could do any more damage.  It was better to cut my losses, than to let them continue on the remote chance they might fix it.   Now, I had a bike with misaligned chain rings, and bent teeth in the chainrings.  I was on my own and would have to get the job done by myself.  I bent back the teeth with my pliers, and then proceeded to straighten the chain rings by pounding them with my small crescent wrench.  As a side note, this worked, but it would be more effective with a larger hammer and a block of wood.  This is probably not the proper way to adjust chain rings, and to this day, I still don't know what the right way is. 
  It was another easy, short day. The road followed close to the lake, through burned out fields and spindly forests.  Once again, there was little shade on the road, but this was not important so early in the day.  My pace picked up, and I arrived at the campsite/guesthouse just as the owner's family was finishing breakfast.     The family was originally from Zimbabwe, but had their property expropriated some years back.  They were now running a guesthouse/restaurant for passing overland trucks and the occasional tourist trying to escape from the party zone in Cape Maclear.  They had built up a micro resort with cabins, a campground, and a dormitory by the lake. I opted to take a dorm bed instead of pitching my tent.  The dorm was only marginally more expensive, and was currently empty.  After getting unpacked and sorted out, I went to the living room to discover, wait for it .SATELLITE TELEVISION!  And, strangely enough, there was nothing on. That is, unless you count cricket.  I never did understand the nuances of cricket, or even the rules.  An English traveller was kind enough to explain it to me then, and it almost made sense.  I watched the game for a bit, got confused, and then mustered up enough energy to do some laundry.  With that out of the way, it was time for lunch. I was back in tourist Africa again, where nsima is only a bad memory.  The English traveller and I ordered beans and toast for lunch.  We talked, and waited, and waited, and waited.  Finally, after an hour, our meals arrived.  The owner's daughter set our plates down, completely oblivious to the fact that it took an hour to toast four slices of bread and heat up a can of beans.  It seems that African time applies to all people, both white and black. I spent the rest of the afternoon reading in the lakeside bar.  It was a welcome change from the royalty treatment that I was getting whenever I stopped somewhere.  As much as everyone likes attention, it can be very tiring to constantly acknowledge everyone's friendliness, and smile and be polite all the time.  I wonder how Prince Charles manages. That evening, I ordered spare ribs for dinner, and waited, and waited, and waited.  This time, owing to the fact that somebody probably had to hunt down a pig, it took two hours to get something to eat.  Despite the wait, or perhaps because of it, the food was delicious.  While waiting, I saw a bit more cricket, and discovered that the final game of the Stanley Cup  (hockey, for all you unenlightened infidels) was to air in two days.  I thought about staying an extra day to see the game, but had to consider how long it  might take to get served another meal.  To further add to the dilemma, the place was more expensive than non-tourist Africa and I was running low on currency.   
   For the first 20 km, I passed burnt out fields and scrub, with the occasional Malawian pedestrian.  What was unusual was that the people had changed.  Previously, I would ride past children and they would greet me with 'Mzungu' or 'Hello, Mister'.  Today, I was greeted by almost every child (and a few adults) with the universal  cry of 'Give money'.  With such close proximity to the beaches of Lake Malawi, begging from tourists had become a viable career option.        Gradually, the land rose and the flora changed from scrub to grassland.  Cattle lolled about in the shade of the small groves of red barked trees dotting the landscape. It was now nearing noon, and the sun was doing its best to roast me alive.  I tried to find a bottle shop but was surrounded by begging children every time I stopped.  It was agonizing to ride at the point of heat exhaustion, but the thought of being surrounded by open palms and begging voices kept me on the saddle.  Eventually, I arrived in Mua, and nearly kissed the ground to celebrate.        The Mua sanctuary was set up by Father Boucher, a missionary from Montreal.  He encouraged the local villagers to carve wooden figures, and set up a small mission and museum.  I pitched my tent on a grass knoll overlooking the botanical garden and set about to explore the area. The mission was built on the bluff of a small forested hill on the edge of the Dedza plateau.  There were several halls, a botanical garden, a small zoo, and a museum.  The museum focussed on the three tribes in the area.  It was surprisingly good for such a small place, and had very informative and colourful displays of the different types of masks used as well as detailed descriptions of the history of each tribe, and the religious beliefs. The village of Mua was a short walk away.  It was very small, but somehow supported a few market stalls and a lone restaurant.  Sadly, the lack of stalls meant my dietary choices were limited to nsima, and whatever vegetables I could find.      Mua was relief.  With and idyllic setting, and friendly, but not too friendly villagers,  I felt like I could relax and recharge without having to look over my shoulder for criminals or beggars.  The Australians who told me about Mua had given me great advice, and I was glad to have stopped here. 
  I spent three days in Mua. My knees were sore, and there was some numbness in my fingertips.  A few days of rest were in order.  I spent much of the time reading, eating nsima, and helping Father Boucher with various tasks at the mission.      There was also a small craft store that sold wood carvings done by villagers at the mission.  I ended up buying some small ones, being careful to remind myself that I still had to carry them to Lilongwe.   To prevent temptation, I would think about the two Australians who were carrying around  a very heavy, half meter tall carving throughout sub Saharan Africa, and their failed attempts to send it back to Australia 
  By the time we finished chatting about the route, it was nine in the morning and getting hot.  I set off, thinking it was an easy sixty km to Salima.  An hour later, the heat was starting to get to me, and to make matters worse, I could feel myself starting to bonk.  With my body screaming for some sort of energy, I drank a jar of honey, and continued riding.  Surprisingly enough, I felt better and rode into Salima shortly before one in the afternoon. In an all too familiar pattern,  Salima turned out to be another less than exciting place with grotty hotels and restaurants that served nothing but nsima.  There were several hotels to choose from, but being tired and lazy, I took the first one that I could find.  This turned out to be a mistake.  After I checked in, I took a shower to cool down, and then lay down for a quick nap.  I felt a bit feverish when I woke up, and noticed that my arms were developing small pustules. The water must have been dirty, and entered through a cut that I had received earlier. It did not seem serious, so I took the bike out to look for something to eat.  I was very tired of nsima, and cruised the market for fried potatoes and chicken.  I had thought to ride to Lake Malawi, but was now feeling more fatigued and abandoned the idea in favour of resting.    Quite unexpectedly, I found an internet caf near the main market.  The caf may have been trying to cash in on the sparse tourist traffic passing through on the way to Lake Malawi, as there were no Africans in the place. Like most of the internet services, this one was also painfully slow and expensive.  With e-mail finished, I headed back into the market and eventually found some chicken and potatoes.  As simple and greasy as it was, this  meal tasted delicious compared to the nsima I had been eating for the last three days.  Satiated, and tired, I rode back to the hotel for a good night's sleep. 
This was the day when the cycling stopped being fun.  I had seen enough run down hotels, and eaten enough horrible nsima to fully appreciate the African experience, and everyone and their dog asking me for money was starting to really annoy me.      By early afternoon, I had ridden to Mvera, and decided to call it a day.  Whether it was the fever, or my travel fatigue, I was getting increasingly paranoid, and could not help feeling like I was in an episode of Twin Peaks, where everything is normal, but strangely wrong.  There was just one rest house in Mvera.  Unlike other towns, the rest house attendant was very surly, and did not seem to want to rent me a room.  Tired, and unsure if there was anywhere else to stay within fifty kilometers, I used what little charm skills I had, and managed to get him to give me a room.  Unfortunately, a closer look at the rest house revealed disturbing amounts of empty bottles.  I had once again chosen to stay at the local watering hole.  My room was also looking disturbingly familiar.  Bad paint, a run down single bed with questionable looking sheets, and three walls you could touch simultaneously.   Even so, a bed was a bed, and I needed one.  While I was sorting my gear, I heard the not too distant sounds of a woman retching behind the walls of the rest house.  This was my signal to get out and take a look around. With the rest of the afternoon free, I stepped out to explore the market in Mvera.  Despite the stalls, the market area felt remarkably slow, and lacked any sort of bustle or vibrancy.  To top things off, the restaurant signs I had seen early turned out to date from a happier time, when there was some sort of business in town.  I got the impression from the half empty market that Mvera was slowly withering away.  In the market, some kids started shadowing me, and generally were being annoying.  Eventually they got bored of following me, as I did nothing interesting except  buy some fried potatoes for dinner. On the way back from the market, a glazy eyed man grabbed me and said 'I want to be your friend'  Given my state of paranoia,  I said that I was not feeling well enough to go for a drink, and hustled back to the rest house.      The owner was at  the rest house when I got back.  He seemed to be the only normal person in the town.  He had been in the army for 38 years, and retired to Mvera.  It was interesting to talk with him, but the infection on my arms was tiring me too much to keep talking. I tried to get some sleep in my room.  Soon after I lay down, two men decided to have a loud argument in the unfinished room beside me.  This went on far too long, but eventually I fell asleep. 
My arms were getting worse, making me  feverish and tired.  Though it was cooling down, I took nearly seven hours to ride the 65 km to Lilongwe.  On the outskirts of Malawi, I was running out of energy.  When a passing Malawian on a bicycle called out 'Hey Superman!' to me, my spirits lifted, and I proudly rode to the center of town. At the guest house,  I met two other travellers, both of whom were trying to establish tourist related businesses.  Derek was from Sweden, and ran cultural tours to Malawi for Swedes.  Mick hailed from Australia, and was in town to get some permits to set up a small lodge near some rock climbing cliffs in northern Malawi.   We headed out for dinner at the chicken biryani place.  The owner was happy to see me, and more happy to see that I had brought others.  No doubt, she already had further plans for house additions that would be financed by my biryani habit.   
  Guessing that the clinic was closed for lunch, we went to meet with some administrators.  Derek  wanted to arrange for tours of the hospital and needed to get permission from the hospital.  While he was meeting with some of the higher ups, I had a good look at the hospital. Getting into a serious accident in Malawi would be really bad.  The hospital had very few resources, and was very busy.  Sadly, in a country ravaged by drought and corruption, there was not any indication that conditions were going to get better any time soon. After the meeting finished, we headed back to the skin clinic.  It was well past lunch, there was still nobody at reception, and the lineup was still outside.  Not being sure when the clinic would reopen, I tried the door, and found that it had been unlocked the entire time.  I walked in and looked around until I found somebody sweeping the floor.  He fetched me a doctor, who prescribed me four days of oral antibiotics and some topical antibiotic powder.  I felt a bit bad about jumping the queue, but then again, how long would they have waited without me barging in?   When we returned to the guest house, I took the first antibiotic.  The effect was almost immediate.  That evening, I could almost see the infection draining, and the inflammation disappear.  The fever was gone within a few hours.  To help my recovery, I would take it easy, and convalesce.  With little else to do, I helped Mick draft a business plan for his rock climbing/abseiling venture.  I still wonder whether he ever got it off the ground, as we were making it up as we went along, and I was still a bit feverish.   I spent one more day in Lilongwe, doing very little except eating chicken biryani and sorting out what to leave behind on the trip to the eclipse.  Surprisingly enough, I weeded out about 5 kg of exposed film, useless tools, and souvenirs that would not be needed in Zambia. 
I left the guesthouse at 6:30 AM, riding along empty city roads to the highway junction.  It was cloudy that day, and cooler than usual.  The main highway ran straight through the endless brown fields.   It was slightly downhill, and I was making great time. I passed through Nametete at  9:45 AM, about two hours earlier than I expected.  Everything was going great, and then I got the first flat tire of the entire trip. This was surprising because I expected to have flats every day, not once a month.    Like usual, a crowd gathered when I stopped, and proceeded to offer helpful advice and helping hands changing the tube.  Just as I was tightening up the axle, a police car came from a road block that I had passed ten kilometers earlier, and asked if I needed any help.  I said I was fine, and thanked them for their concern.  They turned around and headed back to the road block.  It completely escaped my mind to ask them how they knew, and why they did not have anything better to do than drive ten kilometers out of their way to help a tourist fix a flat tire.  It must have been a slow day. I was getting excited.  The hills that marked the end of Malawi and the start of Zambia were getting closer.  About ten kilometers from Mchinji, I checked the time, and stopped for a celebratory meal of roadside fried potatoes.  It was only two in the afternoon!  I arrived in Mchinji an hour later and found a grotty hotel to stay in.  It had occurred to me to ride to Chipata in Zambia but this was another thirty five km away. This would be risky, as I had no idea what time the border would close or how long it would take me to clear customs.  I certainly did not want to arrive in Chipata after dark, or worse, get stuck overnight at the border post.  Chipata would have to wait until tomorrow.      Mchinji was more pleasant than I expected, but extremely humid.  My antibiotic powder turned into a paste, and I felt cold and clammy as soon as the sun went down.  There was not much too the town, other than a few hotels and a small market.  However, I did manage to find a restaurant in the market that served rice, which was a huge surprise given my past luck of finding palatable food in small towns. 
That being said I ended up leaving Mchinji at 6:45 AM, a bit later than I usually did.  It was about five kilometers uphill to get to the  Malawi border post.  It took five minutes to get stamped out of Malawi, and into no man's land.  I rode another ten kilometers along a slightly uphill road, past settlements, general stores, and rest houses before getting to the Zambian border post.  No man's land seemed only to be a suggestion.  What kind of no man's land has a hotel in it? At the Zambian side, it took about ten minutes to get stamped in.  The border hustlers seemed a bit confused when they saw me.  Unlike most of the mzungu arriving at the border,  I did not need to get a ride to Chipata, nor did I need to change money at extortionate rates to pay for the ride.  And people call cyclist tourists crazy! It was exhilarating to finally get to Zambia.  The letter Z was done, and I could now concentrate on getting to the eclipse.  As soon as I crossed the border, everything felt different.  The cloud tipped hills were covered with lush, dark green forests and grey boulders seemed to pop out of the landscape.  It was a wilder, more desolate place, and much less crowded than Malawi.  The people even looked healthier than Malawians.   (Bear in mind that about one third of the people in Malawi are HIV positive)    I really enjoyed the rest of the ride to Chipata.  It was mostly downhill,  and I was constantly passing and being passed by two Zambian students.  They were riding rickety Indian one speeds, and had to work hard to go uphill.  With superior gearing, I passed them easily.  When the hill went down, they quickly caught up, and it was my turn to be passed.   We had a good laugh each time it happened.  The game went on until we reached Chipata, where they turned off to go to one of the local schools. I found a campsite in Chipata and quickly set up.  It was a bit disorienting.  For much of the last month, I would arrive later in the day, and try to get my business done in a last ditch, exhausted rush before everything closed.  It was still only about nine thirty, I was feeling fresh and energetic, and I had the rest of the day to explore Chipata.   Chipata turned out to be one of the most pleasant border towns that I have ever visited.  It was clean, friendly and attractive, as far as border towns go.  Best of all, it had a large supermarket with a bakery that served cheese bread.  I loaded up with cheese bread, nuts, peanut butter, and biscuits with Rambo on the wrapper.  I wonder if Sly Stallone is aware of this? The regular market was also good.  I bought a papaya, some tomatoes and bananas,  and a few pieces of fried chicken.  Loaded with food, I walked into the hills outside of Chipata, stopping for a picnic lunch on top of a hill.  Forest and hills stretched into the horizon.  Somewhere out there was my destination.   When I returned back to the campsite, I met two travellers who were escaping from the eclipse and all the hoopla. Somebody was putting on a ten day rave in Lusaka.  The rave had just started, and would be ending a few days after the eclipse.  Lusaka was turning into a zoo, with hotel prices and restaurant meals skyrocketing as more and more people converged on the capital.   I decided that I would head to Luangwa  to view the eclipse, and stay as far away as possible from Lusaka. 
    I was staying in yet another filthy room, in a town that had no reason to exist other than its proximity to paved road to Mozambique.  The junk dealers told me the story that was becoming all too familiar.  There was no real opportunity to find work in this part of Zambia. There were no mines, and no industry here.  If you wanted a job with the government, you had to know the right people.   Everyone else scraped by on whatever the could sell or scrounge from the earth.  The economic situation seemed dire, and they complained about a lack of access to markets in Lusaka.  There was plenty of food grown here, but nobody could afford a vehicle to transport it to the big cities.      It was food for thought, and that made me hungry for some dinner.  In Zambia, there was no nsima.  Instead, they had nshima, which was exactly the same, except for the spelling, and the coarseness in the texture.  With no other choice, I reluctantly ate some for dinner, and turned in for the evening.     
  Petauke was my next destination.  The highway was getting progressively worse for wear.  Some sections had been eroding away for some time, leaving a maze of potholes to steer around, while other sections had gradually become more and more uneven as the ground settled beneath the tarmac.  I rode along the highway, doing my best to avoid the potholes and lumps.  By early afternoon, I was hot and tired, but kept pushing on.  I hit a stretch of road that was nothing but repaired potholes, and was subject to the bumpiest stretch of pavement I have ever been on.  My bike agreed, and promptly told me so by snapping a spoke to get my attention.     One of the sounds you do not want to hear is the sound of a spoke breaking.  This type of breakdown was one that I was not equipped for.  I had no vice with me, or even a free wheel tool.  With no other choices, I started pushing the bike along highway.  Fortunately, I had broken down only one and a half kilometers from Petauke.      In Petauke, I found a rest house to stay.  The manager, Nazareth, was with a very friendly, and helped me find a bike mechanic, who proceeded to fix my wheel.  It was fascinating to see the mechanic work.  Without a vice or freewheel tool, he took a hammer and metal pin and proceeded to pound the free wheel loose.   This took him fifteen minutes.   Then, it was easy to replace the broken spoke and rebuild the wheel.   However, I took it for a ride and discovered that the hub had fallen so far out of true that I could not use my three lowest gears.  I took it back to the mechanic, who straightened it enough to get six of the seven gears working.  This would have to work for the next two hundred kilometers. That evening, I ate nshima at the rest house, and started talking to a truck driver who was staying overnight.  He had seen me on the highway, and seemed very interested in where I had been and where I was going.   He told me the road was bad until Nyimba, but was newly paved after that.  It was also downhill for much of the route.   All of the sudden, I felt safe in the country.  Everyone on the road had seen me, and I felt like there would be always be somebody to help me out if I got hurt. Speaking of which, my antibiotics ran out that night.  Although my arms looked like they had healed, I would not know for sure until a few days had passed.  I spent the rest of the night talking with the hotel manager, Nazareth.  He was a bit of an outsider, as his uncle owned the place, and hired Nazareth from out of town to run it.  Nazareth was not intending to stay there forever, and was slowly accumulating a stockpile of bricks.  His dream was to take these bricks and build a general store.  He had not decided where just yet, but was looking for likely locations 
As I was leaving the rest house, a man came up to me and wished me a safe trip to Luangwa Bridge.  This was mystifying, as I had never met him.  It seems that he was a truck driver too, and all the drivers now knew of my destination.  He mentioned that he too had seen me along the highway, and I got the impression that I was one of the topics of discussion during rest breaks.  Just in case I was not, I let him know that I would be looking for a ride on the way back to Chipata, and to let the other drivers know.    The road was still bad.  Some sections were potholed to oblivion, while others had been paved with a gravel like substance that made it impossible to spot lumps in the road until it was too late.  I'm not sure what the scenery was like, because I spent most of the time with my eyes on the road, in search of potholes and hidden depressions.    At Nyimba, the road suddenly changed from potholes to new asphalt.  I was in heaven, as I felt that I could ride on this without further bending of the hub.  Now that I could pay attention, I was able to see that I was passing through the heavily forested hills.    One bad thing about forested hills is that you do not really know where you are, nor can you see where you are going.  I had ridden through the hills for hours, and still had not found Kachalola.  Like usual, nobody I asked had any idea how far it was, and just made up an answer to make me happy.  By the time I found somebody who really knew how far it was, I was able to see it. Kachalola had to be one of the strangest places that I ever stayed in.  The town itself was made up of two small clusters of shops by the side of the road.  The hotel was on the other side of the road, and seemed to be  larger than the town.      I went to the hotel to get a room for the night, and a meal.  Though expensive, the room was clean, and had working lights.  There was absolutely nobody else staying there that night, and I got the impression that they had not seen a guest for some time.  Despite my being the only guest around, my dinner could only be served between seven and nine o'clock.      Having found a place to rest I took a walk along the town. There was a promising looking general store.  I tried to buy some bread there, but they said they only had scones.  Here I was, in the middle of nowhere,  and unable to buy bread, but able to get scones.  The place was taking on a distinct, Twin Peaks feel, and I suddenly felt like I was the road side attraction. Back at the hotel, I counted the hotel staff while waiting for them to get ready to get around to perhaps prepare my dinner.  It looked like there were around ten to fifteen staff members, all of whom had some unknown function at the hotel.  The 30000 k (about 8CDN) I paid for the room would not go very far between the staff, let alone the owner. At seven, dinner was served.  It was beans, rice, and fried chicken, and by far the tastiest meal I had eaten in Zambia.  Granted, this was unfair competition, as the de facto meal in these parts was nshima.  While eating, I asked the cook how the hotel stayed in business.  He did not seem to understand, and said that it was better than working at Bridge camp, where employees only got paid if guests were there.  He seemed reluctant to answer my real question, and I did not want to push him.   After dinner, I headed back across the grounds (a bit like walking across town) to my room.  I tried to take advantage of the working electricity, but was too tired to read, and soon fell asleep. 
Riding from Kachalola was easy.  The road was mostly downhill, and wound through heavily forested hills.  At each ridge, I looked ahead, expecting to see the land flatten, but it never did.  After five hours of riding, I began to wonder how far it was to Luangwa bridge.  The highway in this section had almost no traffic, and few pedestrians.  With hills all around, it was impossible to get a landmark to gauge distance.    The first pedestrian I saw was lighting brush fires ahead of me.  I caught up with him, and he said it was 67 km to Luangwa bridge and asked if I wanted to buy some stones.  Later on, I would find out that he was lighting the fires as a way of gathering rodents for food.  The brush fires drove the rodents into their holes, where he would collect them later. With 67 km to go, I felt weak and defeated.  Five hours of riding and only 23 km?  It did not seem right, but it was the only information I had.  Like it or not, I had to keep riding, and resolved to make it  before dark, regardless.  I picked up the pace a bit. About five km later, I saw a sign for the Luangwa Bridge mission.  Just how big could the township of Luangwa Bridge be?  I continued and rode to the top of a small pass, where I saw the Luangwa river, and the Luangwa bridge running across it.  I had misheard the fire starter, who probably said 'six to seven' and not 'sixty seven'.   Luangwa Bridge turned out to be little more than a small cluster of road side stands and a sign to a gas station in Luangwa.  There was not anything that looked like a bike mechanic shop  in sight.  I stopped at the market for a bit of lunch, and some food supplies.  There was plenty of time.  The camp site was only about two kilometers away. After lunch, I rode the final two kilometers along a bumpy dirt road.  Finally, I saw the campsite gate, knocked on the door, and wheeled my bike inside the compound.  I made it!   The bike tour was officially over here.  With the wonky hub, it was better to stop riding, and use other  transport until I could get to a place where I could fix the bike.  All you people who want to read about cycling can stop here.  Once inside, I had about two minutes to relax.  There were four other people staying at the camp site, and they were just about to take a boat tour on the Luangwa river.  I tagged along for a great time.  The river was quite shallow, allowing the boatmen to use poles to propel the boat.  We drifted down stream, in search of crocodiles and exotic birds.  I relaxed, happy that I somebody else was doing the work for a change.       With me on the boat were two Dutch girls, a somewhat eccentric old Dutch man, and a young English traveller.  They were all heading to Lusaka for the eclipse.  I would have to find some other company to head down to Luangwa.    After the boat ride was over, I went to the campsite bar with the two Dutch girls.  They were students, and had just finished practicums in Zambia.  We were joined by the Dutch man and the English traveller, and played cards until the sun set.  At the bar, the dinner menu was expensive for those on a budget, so we ordered the cheapest item on the menu, which happened to be nshima.  It was one thing to eat nshima at local prices, but almost insulting to pay $3USD for it at the bar.  As it was so expensive, we did not order any drinks.  The staff, correctly guessing we were not going to be spending any more money that evening, unceremoniously shut down the power a few minutes after we finished dinner.  In the now pitch black night, we stumbled down the steep path to our tents. 
As I was stepping out of the restaurant, I noticed that somebody had started deep frying fish steaks by the side of the road.  Not only were they cheap (1500 k, or about 50 cents CDN) they were fresh, and would go down well with some fresh bread from the market.  My dinner was set.  Fish, bread, and tomatoes.  Not all four food groups, but close enough for me.   I spent the afternoon doing laundry, rearranging my packs, and reading.  It was one of those lazy days where going anywhere just is not a possibility.  Some more people had arrived that day, but I was unable to find a ride to Luangwa.  I did not want to hitch, but this was looking like my only possibility.   That evening, I met Rolf.  He was the owner of the campsite, and said that he could give me a ride down to Luangwa.  He did not know precisely when he would be leaving but said it would probably be around lunch  tomorrow.  I was elated to have a ride.  I was finally getting ground zero. 
I waited past lunch, and Rolf was busy running about.  I was getting worried that he would cancel at the last minute, and I would be unable to get  to Luangwa in time.  Finally, at three thirty, Rolf said we were going, and  got into the land rover.  He had a group of three tourists paddling down the Luangwa river, and was arranging to meet them somewhere along the way.   We headed down a horrible dirt road.  It was the kind of road that is fine for cars, but terrible for bicycles. There was plenty of loose gravel, and worse than that, the surface had turned into a washboard from all the motor vehicles.  There were few bicyclists along the road to flatten out a path.  I thought about my wonky hub, and 90 km of dirt.  I was very glad to be in a vehicle instead.   Nobody was really sure where the canoeing tourists were, so we spent a good portion of time finding spots close to the river, and climbing trees to see if they were close.  Eventually they arrived, and Rolf transferred more supplies to them.  With this business done, we headed to Luangwa.  By the time we had met the canoeists, the daylight was fading.  We continued on into the night, passing a few Zambians pushing a pickup up hill.  We saw their tracks on the road for at least five km.  How long had they been pushing , and how long were they going to go? Finally, we reached Luangwa, which was little more than a gas station, a border crossing, and a few scattered houses here and there.  Rolf dropped me off at the gas station, and said that the owner was probably around back. I thanked Rolf for the ride, walked around back, and found the owner and his family in the middle of some after dinner brew drinking.  They showed me to the campsite, where I set up, and settled in. Tomorrow was the eclipse and I could hardly wait. 
   Sunshine!  The last time I saw an eclipse, it was -10 out, and cloudy.  Since that time, I had been loosely plotting a vacation to see an eclipse in more amicable surroundings.  Today would be warm, and with any luck, clear during the eclipse.  I would finally get to see an eclipse clearly. It was still early in the morning.  To pass the time until the eclipse, I took a walk around Luangwa.  While the town was larger than any place I had stayed at in the last week, it was little more than a few houses clustered around a gas station and a customs post.  Even so, it marked the confluence of the Luangwa and Zambezi rivers, as well as the border point between Zambia, Mozambique, and Zimbabwe.  Tempting as it was, I resisted the urge to take a boat across the river.  Mozambique and Zimbabwe would have to be seen on another trip.   After taking a tour of the town, I headed back to the camp site.  Paddy, the owner of the campsite/gas station, mentioned that he would be taking a boat up the Zambezi that morning to meet up with some others.  He said I could get a ride with him if there was any space. Luckily, there was a bit of space, and I was soon on my way down the Zambezi river.  The river marked the border, and it suddenly dawned on me that I was in between Zambia and Zimbabwe.  This was the only place in the world where you could be completely surrounded by countries starting with the letter 'Z'.  Surely, nobody could question my alphabetic travelling prowess now!    Eventually, we landed at a sand bar in the middle of the river.  Paddy said that there would not be time to get back to Luangwa for the eclipse and asked if I minded staying at the sand bar with a group of South Africans for a barbecue instead.  My rubber arms, if they needed any twisting, had no comment, so I accepted the invitation for them. There really is not a good way to describe a total eclipse.  The sun gradually gets blotted out by the moon, looking a bit like a pac man, of all things.  Eventually, only a sliver of sun is uncovered, and the two bodies resemble a diamond ring.  At totality,  the sky turns dark, and there is nothing but a glowing corona.  It looks like there is a hole in the sky.  And then, it goes back to a diamond ring, and then a pacman.    But, don't just rely on my description.  In fact, it may be better to ignore what I just said.  Total eclipses are unforgettable, and religious experiences to some.  Get out and see one.  The next one will sweep through North Africa and Central Asia in 2006.  That's plenty of time to ride there to get a good spot! By the time we got back to Luangwa, it was late afternoon.  Already, the exodus of eclipse watchers had begun.  I thought about asking for a ride back to Luangwa bridge, but deliberately dawdled until most of the vehicles had left.  Although there was little to see in Luangwa, I was very fond of the campsite, and stayed one more night.   
  There wasn't much traffic, and the few vehicles that passed by didn't stop.  Finally, an hour later, a pickup for an NGO picked me up.  They were in search of a broken down truck that had left from Luangwa earlier in the day.  We rode for forty km, and stopped when they spotted the truck by the side of the road.  As they were unloading, a telecom truck came by, and gave me a lift back to the campsite at Luangwa bridge.   I packed the bike up, and wheeled it to the crossroads.  At the crossroads, I spotted a parked 4x4.  The owner was an American missionary who was heading to Petauke with his family.  We strapped the bike to the roof, and headed along the highway.  When we arrived in Petauke, it was nearly four in the afternoon, and the traffic had started to thin out.  I tried hitching anyhow, but couldn't get a suitable ride.  By five, the sun was getting close to the horizon, and it was time to call it a day. Even if I was stuck in Petauke overnight, it was good to see Nazareth and the rest of the staff at the guesthouse.  We spent the evening discussing Nazareth's future plans for his store, including how to make muffins and pies.  Hopefully, one day, you will be able to get a decent piece of pie in Zambia, and it will be all because of my taste buds. 
  They let me off in Chipata, and I headed for the campsite.   It was only 9:30 AM and I was already in Chipata.  At the campsite, I set up my tent, and headed to the bus station to inquire about what was heading to  the National Park.  The bus station workers said the next bus would leave some time in the afternoon, and that there would be no bus tomorrow, as it was Sunday. Hearing this, I rushed back to the campsite, explained the situation, and packed up.  The campsite would store my bike for the three days I planned to be gone.  Then, it was a quick trip to the supermarket to stock up on supplies (including more Rambo biscuits) and back to the bus station.  The bus trip was a disaster that took nineteen hours to travel 120 km.  However, I did meet three other travellers on the bus who I would camp with in the national park. 
            
  At the campsite, I got lucky again.  A German student was driving to Lilongwe, and could give me and my bike a lift the rest of the way.  This was especially fortuitous, as I was unable to find anybody in Chipata who knew how to fix my hub.      The rest of the day was spent eating, and finding things to eat.  The fried chicken seller was very glad to see me again, as was the papaya seller.  I also found a great stall to buy samosas and replenished my supply of Rambo biscuits.  I had finished cycling, but nobody seemed to have told my stomach.   
We ate the remaining samosas, and saved the papaya for dinner. After I set up my tent, I lay down for a quick relax.  It was too hot to put the fly on, so I just lay down inside, staring at the sky through the mesh.  Dreamily, I let my mind wander, barely noticing how the wind picked up.  Soon, it began gusting, but I remained in the tent, oblivious to the outside world.  At that point, I watched the blue, cloudless sky, only to see a tent fly over me.  The tent circled the campsite once or twice and then landed in the forest beside the campsite.  The wind died down as quickly as it had started, and all was peaceful, and the owner's tent was unhurt. Jurgen had driven a beat up Mazda (or something like it) to South Luangwa National Park and back  This was remarkable, as the road  is generally recognized as the worst one in Zambia.  Even so, the car did not survive unscathed.  Jurgen was carrying the muffler and some unidentified pieces of bumper with him, hoping to find some way of reattaching them when he got a chance.  Also, the front wheel made disturbing noises when he turned left.  Further inspection showed that one of the bolts had fallen out of the axle, and the last bolt was dangerously loose.  I was very glad he found the problem, as the bolt would have certainly fallen off, taking the wheel with it.   With mechanical problems out of the way, I took a walk around the campsite, and into the adjoining countryside.  It was beautiful, lush forest, supposedly with lots of pythons, surrounded by fields.  I walked along the road, being passed by numerous bicycles carrying jugs and jerry cans.  Later that evening, I discovered that this was the start of the smugglers road, where people would take cheap petrol from Malawi, and resell it in Zambia.   
  We cruised up the last ten or so kilometers to the Zambian border.  The tightened axle bolt seemed to be holding out fine.  Contrary all my expectations, it was easy to cross the border in a car.  I had expected all sorts of bureaucratic hassles, bribes, and delays, but they never materialized.  Because Jurgen had bought the car in South Africa, there was no need for a carnet, or any other import papers.  Within twenty minutes, we were stamped out of Zambia, and into Malawi.  The Malawi side was just as seamless, and soon we had been stamped into Malawi.      Once we crossed the border, we drove to Mchinji to get fuel and a replacement bolt.  Despite some blatant attempts to overcharge, we eventually found a reasonably priced bolt for the wheel.  Soon, it was installed and we sped along to Malawi.  It seemed strange to pass through Malawi so quickly, considering how long it took to go the other way.  After a few hours of driving, we arrived in Lilongwe.  The guesthouse was full, making it necessary to stay at the camp site.   I did not really like the camp site.  It was further from the center of Lilongwe, and catered to overland tour groups.  However, it was only for one night, and I needed to get the bike fixed. I found a mechanic who looked at the hub, and said that it wasn't a dropped bearing, but a bent hub.  Fixing it would cost only a few hundred kwacha for a new hub, and a 100 kwacha to rebuild the wheel.  Half an hour later, I had a working bike again.   There was one last order of business.  I was in Lilongwe, and had a craving for chicken biryani.  I went to the restaurant to order one for Sunday, only to find out that the restaurant was closed on Sundays.  Luckily, the owner recognized me, said that she would send somebody to open the restaurant if I told her what time I wanted to eat.  It pays to be a regular. 
We walked to the restaurant, and just like it was promised, somebody opened the restaurant for us, and even cooked up something for Jurgen.  When the food arrived, Jurgen had a taste of the biryani, and announced that he would be ordering a biryani for tomorrow, as I wasn't about to share very much of mine.  We rushed through lunch, and followed the growing exodus of spectators to the stadium.     The line stretched far past the stadium and moved at a glacial pace.  Everyone in line was getting impatient.  Crowds of people milled about the edge of the stadium, seemingly for no purpose. I asked some of the neighours in the line whether this was the correct line, and was reassured that we were in the correct line to get inside.       Suddenly, a group of men split off from the milling crowd, and hopped the stadium fence. They easily ran around the now confused guards.  It was like trying to stop a fire with a broom.  Other people got the idea, and hopped the fence as well.   All hell broke loose, as the vastly outnumbered guards tried in vain to stop the horde from getting into the stadium.  For every person they chased back, another would sneak in behind.  Soon, the situation got out of control, and one of the guards started firing his AK 47.  This did wonders for crowd control, and the would be gate crashers quickly retreated, only to lurk at the edge of the fence and wait for another opportunity.      Meanwhile, the line meandered forward.  After an hour, we were within 20 m of the gate.  Everyone started pushing and jockeying to get to the ticket window.  Fortunately, we were taller, and better fed than most of the people in the line, and eventually got to the ticket window.  It was 40 k (less than a dollar, in just about any currency) each, which was a pittance.   Once inside the gate, we had a quick drink from one of the numerous cold drink sellers, and then walked into the stadium.  It was packed solid, and we were the only mzungu in the place.  Suddenly, I heard my name, and saw some of Derek's friends waving to us.  We sat down with them, relieved to finally have made it there.  And the game?  It was good, and ended in a 2-2 tie but anticlimactic compared with the ordeal to get there.      Monday, I finally got a bed in the guesthouse.  It was otherwise an uneventful day.  I cleaned the bike, and tuned it up, and ate chicken biryani with Jurgen and Derek.   The rest of the day was spent spending my remaining kwacha on peri peri sauce and guava juice.   That evening, I arranged a cab to the airport, and went to bed for the last time in Malawi.  It was strange to think that I was heading home, but I was ready to leave.  The infection on my arms was getting worse, and I was really craving a BLT and a bowl of New England clam chowder. 
Despite my outrage at my own stupidity, the plane ride was  very enjoyable.  It flew over Zambia and Tanzania, where I got some great views of Mt. Kilimanjaro.  We landed at the airport in Nairobi around lunch.  I had seven  hours to kill.    This was not really long enough to warrant leaving the airport and heading to Nairobi.  It would have been fifty dollars for a visa, and Nairobi is not knick named 'Nairobbery' for no reason.  I circled the airport a few times, looking for something to do.  Eventually, I found an internet caf, and made arrangements to meet a friend for lunch in Amsterdam the next day.  E-mail really is the greatest!  Then, I headed to a transit lounge, where I ate my last chicken biryani.  I'll miss that restaurant. I flew out on the red eye flight to Amsterdam, and landed in Schipol International at six in the morning.  With nothing to do until lunch, it was an opportune time to take another nap.  I did not sleep well on the plane, and the infection on my arms had spread to my knees.  I was starting to ache. After my nap, I headed out to Amsterdam.  I had to meet my friend at Sloterdijk station, which was just outside the city center.  When I arrived, there really wasn't anything to see.  I always thought of Amsterdam as a place full of old, heritage buildings and instead stepped into a block full of glass, concrete and metal.      I met my friend for a somewhat extended lunch, and afterwards decided that I had enough of tourism for one trip.  It was time to head back to the airport and wait some more.  At the airport, I spent my remaining guilders on chocolate, and proceeded to take another nap. There was not anything else to do.  Schipol was good to wait in, as far as airports are concerned, but there was a limited amount of entertainment available for those who do not like to sit in hotel bars.  After what seemed like too long of a wait, I boarded the plane and fell asleep.  Nine hours, and many movies later, we landed in Vancouver International  Airport. My sister picked me up at the airport, where we promptly drove to the grocery store and bought the raw materials for a BLT and clam chowder.  This was the meal I had been dreaming about for more than a month.  It was good to be home.    Note: I went to the doctor to check out the infection, and it turned out to be from the same family of bacteria that causes flesh eating disease.  Looks like I've got eight lives left. 
The trip was great, and I would do it again, or something reasonably close to it.  Here is a quick summary. Traffic conditions Strange to think that this area would be a good place to ride, but it is.  Outside the major cities, there was little traffic, and drivers would leave you enough room.  Note that this rule broke down to survival of the biggest once the road got busy.  However, a car every 15 minutes was about the right frequency in Zambia, and every 5 minutes in Malawi.   Because there are many cyclists, drivers actually look out for them.  They may not always make allowances for bikes, but at least they are aware (unlike some suburbs in North America) that you are on the road.   The roads were generally rideable, if a little rough in places.  Most roads were paved, and those that were not were mostly fine for riding.  Some road sections had not been properly maintained, and were full of rough sections.  Usually, you could find a fairly smooth single track through the potholes or washboard, but not always.  Often, there was only one paved road, making it much easier to figure out which way to go. Food Compared with just about anywhere else, the food in sub Saharan Africa was pretty dull.  Outside larger towns, food choices were very limited, and usually nsima.   Crime Big cities were dangerous, and best avoided if possible.  Outside the big cities, people were friendly, and helpful.  I got little indication (despite some perhaps infection influenced paranoia) that somebody would mug me in the small towns. Diseases Africa is rife with all sorts of nasty diseases.  I picked up a mild form of flesh eating disease, met two people who had contracted malaria, and heard of others who got bilharzia.  Stomach troubles will strike eventually, and are unavoidable if you spend enough time there.  That being said,  taking precautions is helpful, and doctors know how to treat the common diseases there. Play your cards right, and you will probably be fine. If you do decide to cycle in this part of Africa, some precautions are necessary.  Roads are generally bumpier than in developed countries, and not always paved.  A more robust bike would be better for these parts, especially should you plan to ride more than a few weeks.  There is little support for anything but mountain bikes, and Indian one speeds.  Bike stores were usually only found in the big cities.  Take spare parts, and have your own tools.  It is very important to know how to fix things, and how to make adjustments,  otherwise you may have to let somebody else fix things, which can lead to other problems.   Food was easy to find, but somewhat tasteless.  There were usually small stores in the towns where you could buy dry goods, soft drinks, and bread.  The restaurants were often limited in menu items I had no difficulty finding places to sleep, but had done some advance planning to make sure there would be at least something in the place I was planning to spend the night.  Most towns of any size had some sort of rest house.  I only camped in the national parks.  Wild animals were everywhere, and food should not be stored where it can be easily accessed.   Again, there are all sorts of nasty diseases that you can catch, so be careful.  So far (2003), malaria can only be prevented by not getting bitten, so high concentration DEET (unless you want to wake up after four hours to put more on) and mosquito nets are essential.  Stomach ailments are often caused by drinking bad water.  Bottled water was available most places, but carrying some treatment or a filter would be a good back up plan.   Despite the dangers, this part of Africa was easy to ride in, and full of friendly people and beautiful scenery.  If you plan for disasters, and don't plan a tight schedule, it should be a great trip. 
The cycle trip was part of a larger trip through Qatar, UAE, India, Sri Lanka, and Europe.  Because of time constraints, congestion, and maniacal drivers, I decided not to bike in India.  Instead, I bought cheap bikes in UAE and Sri Lanka.  This was easier than packing a bike each time I had to take a plane.   My route started from Dubai, and went into the Hajar mountains to Masafi.  From there I went north to the Omani border and then road along the coast to Khor Fakkan and Fujairah.  I then headed back to Dubai, and completed the circle.
For bike maintenance, I took a tool kit of a pump, a cool tool, a set of allen keys, some screwdrivers, and a patch kit.  For baggage, I used a 45 l hiking pack, a strap on cordura case, and 35 l daypack.  Everything dense went in the cordura case and hiking pack, while bulky items went in the daypack.  Because this was a trip through the desert, it was easy to travel light, and I skipped carrying a tent, and camping gear.  However, as I would be trekking in India a week,  I also had to carry a -20C sleeping bag, a set of gloves and a fleece jacket.  Because I was unsure of how many towns would have supplies outside Dubai,  I took five liters of water and a dozen bars of fruit leather for emergencies.      In Dubai, I  bought a brand new Taiwanese mountain bike of questionable quality, but good enough to last a week.  It had analog shifters, passable brakes, and 24 speeds, with 4 speeds being unreachable due to bad tuning at the manufacturer.  The cranks had some play, and the headset was loose.  It was not a great bike, but would do.   Then again, what can you expect for $65?  That is in Canadian smackeroos, too!   
All things considered, it would be smart not to try to cover too much ground at first.  To get at least a bit of pleasant riding time, I left from Dubai at sunrise.  It would be cool in the morning, and I would have to face much less rush hour traffic.  From the center of town to the eastern highway was 10 km of city streets and roundabouts.  Although I am not fond of having to weave into traffic on roundabouts, there was little in the way of cars or trucks so early in the morning. It took an hour to get out of Dubai, and onto the main highway.  Even this early, it was already getting hot.  I resorted to taking rest breaks in the shade of the occasional overpasses.  The traffic on the highway was much less than I expected, and riding was easy because of the paved shoulder.  Not surprisingly, there was sand as far as the eye could see, and in all directions.  The desert was remarkably populated, with buildings scattered along the side of the highway, and the occasional camel grazing area. Because I was planning on returning by the same road, I kept my eyes open for potential camping spots, in the event that I arrived too late to get to Dubai. Most of the road was populated, or fenced off, and I could find nothing that looked all that suitable.      At eleven, I stopped in a small town called Daid. I had lunch at an Indian greasy spoon, bought some more water and continued for 15 minutes to the edge of town.  It was now far too hot, with the heat of the sun assaulting me from all directions.  I hadn't acclimatised, had a full stomach, and was going nowhere fast.  I pulled the bike to a carwash,  and asked if I could take a nap there.  The workers were shutting down for the afternoon siesta and kindly allowed me take a nap on a shady bench.  A few hours later, it was only very hot, and I continued.  As I got closer to the Hajar mountains, the countryside slowly changed from flat desert to rocky hills.  While the passing scenery was much more interesting than the desert, it was also uphill.  By five, I was exhausted, and making only slow progress.  I wasn't sure how long it would continue uphill, and I decided to look for a place to camp.   I took a turnoff to a promising looking quarry, and found a good camping site nestled between two small hills.        With no tent, and no sleeping mat,  it wasn't going to be comfortable.  However, I laid a groundsheet out, used the sleeping bag as a mat. Being a -20 C bag, it was far too much for the night time low of 20 C in the desert, but good enough to pad the rocky ground. To keep away any creepy crawlies, I rigged up a mosquito net and a camera tripod as a makeshift shelter.  After a meal of bread, nuts, and yogurt, I settled in to get some sleep.  Just as it was getting dark and I was drifting off, I heard the sound of a mosque call.  Here I was, in the middle of nowhere, and managed to set up beside a mosque. 
The market had not started because it was too early in the morning.  Despite its name, the Friday market runs every day, and is called the Friday market because that is the day that all the people from Dubai show up.  I passed the market, and rode out of Masafi, an otherwise unremarkable town.  The plan of the day was to ride along the northern road to Dibba, and then down the coast to Khor Fakkan.    The Hajar mountains were beautiful in the morning, and it was downhill all the way.  With little traffic, and a cool breeze, it was a perfect riding day.  I rode into Dibba by nine in the morning, and decided to see a bit of the town.  According to the guidebook, there was a huge graveyard in Dibba that couldn't be missed.  And I missed it.  You would think it wouldn't be too hard to find a 10000 plot graveyard.  Perhaps my navigation skills need some work.    The coastal highway to Khor Fakkan was much flatter, hotter, and noisier.  Just out of Dibba, two dozen Porsches and a few infidel BMWs screamed past me, trying to break the sound barrier.  There is lots of money in the Gulf, and it was showing itself off that day.    My ride along the coast was much slower.  This part of UAE gets the most precipitation, and is remarkably green for a desert region.  The coast is littered with small coves and sandy beaches, making it easy to take lots of breaks.  Despite the beckoning attractions, I continued to pedal, and got to Khor Fakkan by early afternoon. Before, in Dubai, the youth hostel staff had said that there was a hostel in Khor Fakkan that was very good, and close to the beach.  In my infinite wisdom, I had forgotten not only to get directions to the hostel, but forgotten to even get a phone number.  I rode up and down the length of the Corniche, figuring that I could spot it if is were close to the beach.  This proved fruitless, as did several inquiries at shops near the Corniche.  'Hostel' is not commonly used, and cheap hotel will only get you directions to a cheap hotel. Eventually, in a diving store, somebody understood me, and drew a map.  The hostel was easy to find, once you knew where to look, and really was only 100 m from the beach.  It was also an incredible deal, at only 25 dirham, or about 10 loonies. After settling in, I took a walk along the Corniche.  It was Friday, the Muslim sabbath,and the promenade and beach were packed.  Perhaps one of the more unusual sights you can see at a Muslim beach are the women.  It is considered provocative and tawdry for women to show just about any part of their body, so women at the beach dress like they would if they were going shopping.  As such, many of the women appear to be wearing portable tents.   An even stranger sight was that there were no Germans.  Germans are well renowned for their engineering, and their ability to get to the beach before anyone else.  Here was a pristine beach, and not a German in sight.  Puzzling, at first, and a bit unsettling.  How could it be possible to have a beach without Germans?  And then, I realized that Khor Fakkan was in a dry emirate, and there was no beer to be found here.   
I did manage to find Madha, which had multiple turnoffs to it , and a large sign pointing in the right direction.  Madha is an Omani enclave in the UAE.  This place was not nearly as pretty or interesting as I had imagined, but the ride around the mountains near Madha was good, desert temperatures not withstanding.    After visiting Madha, I rode back to Khor Fakkan, and found the best value restaurant in UAE.  For a princely sum of 15 dirham ( about 6 loonies) , you can select a fish, and have somebody cook it for you with a plate of rice and vegetables.  This was a welcome change from the kabobs that I had been living on.
As I continued, I began to realize that the entire road was under various stages of construction.  The shoulder was missing, or being built over the majority of the thirty five km, and I had to ride carefully.  With no shoulder, it was necessary to maintain zen like concentration to ride on the thin strip of pavement between the warning line and the dirt.   It did not help to have what seemed like half of Fujairah screaming past me on the way into town.   The scenery wasn't all that interesting, either.  Most of the road was built up with oversized houses, or soon to be strip malls.  Not that it mattered too much what the area looked like, as I had to spend most of my time keeping my eyes and bike on the narrow strip between the passing cars and the rough. I arrived in Fujairah around 9 and just like the Khor Fakkan, had difficulty finding the youth hostel.  Eventually, after much circling and asking directions, I found it.   Although I didn't think 9:30 AM was early, I managed to wake up the morning staff person.  He showed me to a bed ( the one he had been sleeping on) in a grotty room, and then told me that I could pay in the evening when his boss showed up.  This was by far the worst place I stayed in the emirates, and coincidentally, the cheapest, at only 15 dr/night.   With nowhere else to go for the rest of the day, I took a day trip down to a mangrove swamp by the UAE-Omani border.   The trip was pleasant enough, passing through what seemed to be an extended suburb of Fujairah all the way to the swamp.      The mangrove swamp was quite interesting, with scores of fiddler crabs in the mudflats, and the occasional kingfisher.  I was expecting it to be larger, and it seemed to end abruptly and turn into desert in a few footsteps.      The ride back was better, because it was possible to ride along the beach for much of the way.  Riding in loose sand is an exercise in frustration, but there was a strip of hard packed sand in the tidal zone that was fine for riding.  This was much more scenic than an Emirati suburb, and cooler to ride on.   
Of course, sights that are easy to find are not necessarily sights that are worth seeing.  The fort was in bad need of any restoration, and not terribly elaborate.  However, it was still fun to scrabble around the ruins, and was devoid of any tourists besides myself.     I was hungry, and rode back to Fujairah.   Fujairah, being quite large, had a hypermarket where you can buy just about anything edible.  I consumed a liter of ice cream and a roasted chicken.  It's good to be cyclist.  There wasn't much too do in Fujairah itself.  I rode around town, and discovered that the hostel wasn't far from anything, because there really wasn't anything of interest to be far from.  There was a beach, which was devoid of anything, locals and tourists included, and a strange looking amusment park on the Corniche.      That evening, while I was walking around town, an Arab in an Audi stopped me and asked for directions.  It was surprising that he mistook me for a local, but even more surprising that I knew how to get where he wanted to go.  Lucky for him that he wasn't trying to get to any of the tourist destinations that I had been looking for. 
I left around four in the morning, guessing that I could get the uphill portion done in the cool part of the day, and then cruise afterwards.   Sure enough, the lights were on, and I rode in the eerie orange until daybreak.  It was 25 km of uphill, but the air was cool, and there were no cars.  Two hours later, I passed Bitnah, and congratulated myself for making it to the top of the pass so early.  I could see the hills around Masafi in the distance, and thought it would be an easy ride the rest of the way. 12 km later, I arrived in Masafi, dead tired.  When I looked back I realized that the peak of the road was at Masafi, and I had been riding uphill for the last hour without really knowing it.  The perspective only made Masafi look like it was downhill, and I thought it was heat stroke that was tiring me out. As it was only nine in the morning, I stopped in on the Friday market, despite it not being Friday.  There would have been plenty to buy, had I been in the market for carpets ,ceramic pots, or other suitably heavy items to strap to a bike. There wasn't anything else worth carrying for the next 70 km, so I left after only a few minutes.  A good thing about cycling is that you think twice before buying anything.  That is, unless you enjoy having a closet full of carvings and textiles.     From Masafi, it was downhill for 15 km, which flew by in no time.  I was back in the desert again, on a road I had already ridden.   By 11:30,  I arrived at  the Natural History Museum.  This meant I was only 35 km from Dubai.  As it was getting near the heat of the day,  I decided to take a break, and go to the museum.  The guards thought I was crazy to ride to the museum, and even more crazy when I told them I had come from Fujairah.  With the usual bad luck,  I had arrived on family day, and single men were not allowed in the museum.  However, after much pleading, the ticket taker called the main office and I was allowed in. The Natural History Museum was surprisingly good.  It was more a zoo than a museum, and had several species of indigenous wildlife housed inside.  There was an indoor bird sanctuary as well as glass tanks holding several specimens of creepy crawly critters that I'd rather not know about if I were planning on sleeping in a desert.  If anyone reading this decides to camp in the desert, go to the museum after you have finished camping.   I left at two, as the heat of the day was passing, and I wanted to get to Dubai instead of bush camping.  It was an easy, if hot, ride to the outskirts of Dubai.  I rode into town, and nearly got hit several times by the local drivers.  Not wanting to take an ambulance to the hospital, I called it a day, flagged down a cab, and was driven the last few kilometers to the youth hostel.   
That being said, it is a desert, and very hot.  I rode in November, when it was cooling down, and it was still hot.  Summer temperatures reach 50 C, and it is supposed to be very humid as well.  However, there are plenty of settlements along the way, and water is relatively easy to find.  There is no need to take more than a day of water, or food for that matter, as it is available en route. The terrain is pretty dull near Dubai, but gets much more attractive in the Hajar mountains and the east coast.  It is relatively flat, and steep inclines are not common.   The road itself is in very good condition, without a pothole in sight.  There is a shoulder for most of the way, and little traffic once outside Dubai and Fujairah. Traffic, when you get it, is horrible.  Drivers in this region are like teenagers the day after they get their licence.  Larger places like Dubai and Fujairah are particularily bad.  Stay as close to the edge as possible! 
   I have always enjoyed adventure in the outdoors, I'll use any excuse to get out on a hike, a climb, a bike ride or a paddle in my kayak.  My favorite is to be out for several days at a time, living simply with what I carried out there myself and enjoying the company of good friends. All of this of course has to be balanced with family life and working for a living.  I enjoy the adventure so much more because I have a great family to come home to and a good job that I enjoy doing.  Neglect any one of these 3 and life gets unpleasant in a hurry.  On this trip I will be withdrawing heavily from the work and family bank and way overspending on the adventure side.  My thanks goes out to those who will be sacrificing so I can go play. I have commuted to work by bike off and on for the past 12 years.  I love to ride and since I live close enough to work (12 miles) it allows me to have fun outdoors every day for a couple of hours in all kinds of weather.  It fits with my motto "put adventure in your everyday life". I like to explore new places and try out new routes.  Many days I go miles out of my way just to ride a new stretch of road.  I usually don't feel like stopping when I get to work, I'd rather just keep riding (who wouldn't??).  This cross country ride will be a chance to live that dream out.  Point the bike southeast and just keep riding. I'll be using saved up vacation for the trip so I will be on a limited time schedule.  I need to finish within 6 weeks and I have about 3200 miles to ride so that means averaging 80 miles a day with about 5 days of down time.  A pretty tight schedule. My first goal will be the 2 week ride southeast thru Oregon, up and over the Blue Mountains, across the southwest corner of Idaho along the Snake river, and into Utah, Salt lake and to Moab where I'll take a few days off and do some Mt bike riding with my 2 sons and a group of friends from Seattle and Nashville. From there I will turn east and ride thru Colorado, Cortez, Durango, over Wolf Creek Pass and on into Oklahoma, thru the Ozarks in Arkansas and head south a bit to join the Natchez Trace for the ride into Nashville to a friends house for another little break before crossing the Smoky's and heading for Savannah where my wife will meet me for the flight home. Here is the map of my intended route:    My trip will be solo and unsupported, everything I need will either be carried on the bike or purchased along the way (food etc).  I plan to camp most nights, free when I can swing it, and stay in a couple of motels when necessary. I'll be riding a Trek 520 touring bike that a bunch of great friends and family contributed to for my 40th birthday in November 2002.  My wonderful wife Kathy secretly sent out this letter    to about 50 people and they responded very generously.  It is so great to be riding a brand new bike that is made just for trips like this one.  Many hours in the saddle with light spirits and a heavy load. I hope to be able to update this site every few days from library's along the way and will be mailing photo's back home for processing and will have them posted here as they are available. Feel free to post letters to the guestbook attached to this site, I will respond as I am able. Ben Staley 
I loaded the bike down with everything I am planning to take plus added 3 days food for both of us.  A little more weight than I have been training with so far but not too bad.  Right around 45 lbs including water. We took the Mukilteeo - Clinton 9am ferry across and then rode the length of Whidbey Island on Saturday, mostly in the rain but with a slight tailwind.  The rain tapered off when we got to Oak harbor and even a few sunbreaks for the rest of the day after that.  Lots of hills on Whidbey, 300 ft up then down over and over and over.  We probably climbed 3000 to 4000 ft over the course of the day.  The state parks are in Winter mode and mostly closed so that meant it was nice and quiet once we wheeled our bikes past the barrier and up into the woods where the bike in sites are.  The cost of the sites have gone up 75% since last October when Tim and I were there, ouch. While we were paying, some friends of ours surprised us, driving by and talking for a while.  They were up camping for the weekend also.  We would keep running into them at the funniest places the next 2 days. We set up camp and took a good walk down to the beach and watched the tide going out thru the pass, lots of nice whirlpools. 55 miles, 12.3 mph average, in camp at 3:00pm It rained hard all night but the tent held up well.  I brought the tent I'm going to use so I'm glad it did well. We got a late start for the ride, rolled out of camp at 9:15am, it sure takes longer when everything is wet.  Rode northwest around the top edge of Whidbey thru Anacortes, what a gorgeous town!! Great views out into the San Juans from the hill above town. I got a flat while riding thru town and stopped at a gas station to unload the bike to fix it...rear tire of course, our friends drive up for gas, 3nd time we had seen them that day.  I think we ran into them 4 times at various places where our paths crossed for a few minutes, it was really funny. We were glad to turn north after crossing the bridge on Hwy 20 since the wind was blowing out of the south at 20mph or more.  It was cool to "farmer blow" while riding 19 mph and have it fly in front of you :)  The person drafting you appreciates it also. The end of the ride was on one of my favorite roads, Chuckanut drive just south of Bellingham.  It winds along a cliff several hundred feet above the water with great views of the coastal Islands on one side and rock cliffs rising a hundred feet right at the edge of the road on the other.  It gets kind of tricky some places where it is steep with blind corners and very narrow lane with the rock wall right at your elbow, but so worth it. We camped at Larrabee State park, same situation, roll the bikes past the closed sign (this time with the park rangers permission) and camp by ourselves up in the woods.  After setting up we rode the 5 miles further north into Bellingham just for fun.  More heavy rain and wind overnight.  My new thermarest sleeping pad gave it up sometime during the night and went flat, not a great nights sleep. We packed up camp while it misted rain and rode down to a covered picnic shelter to cook breakfast, 8:30 am start with a long way to go before home.  Our route took us back down Chuckanut drive with the road all to ourselves but headwinds starting to really blow.  We fought against the wind for the whole day, 20 to 25 mph steady.  uugg.  But on the bright side, no rain during the ride the whole day!!  Temps were in the mid 40's. It really was just a matter of keeping the pedals moving, slowly putting the miles by and enjoying the things around us.  Many times during the day Kelly surprised me by saying how great it was to be out there on a ride.  He is such a great kid, looking for the good things around us even when the going was tough. We stopped for a well earned huge greasy hamburger and fries for lunch and finished the ride off right as the sun was setting. 73 miles, 11.8 average mph, in just over 6 hrs of ride time. It was a good weekend to get the body ready for 80+ mile days, I have a new respect for just how hard it will be to do it day after day for 45 days in a row.  I just hope I will get stronger every day instead of more beat up and sore.  Really, it seems like it could go either way, I'm counting on stronger. Pizza and cold beer for dinner, followed by a huge bowl of ice cream and a hot shower...home is good. Ben   
Most people's idea of vacation involves much LESS physical effort, not lots MORE physical effort.  Riding a bike all day, every day for a month and a half sounds more like punishment than fun to most people.  Which explains the second question I get asked:  Are you doing this for some sort of charity? Really, there must be some good reason to torture yourself like this.  Short of being in dire need of some sort of therapy, I mean, are you nuts? First off, I think it helps if you just love to ride your bike.  Everybody has something that they really get a kick out of doing.  Riding a bike is one of those things for me.  I just feel good when I'm cruising along, it slows my life down a little and the exersise really makes you feel good.  Even when the weather is nasty I feel lucky to be riding instead of driving.  I'm in a much better mood when I get someplace on a bike rather than fighting thru traffic in a car. So theres that. Another big reason is that most of the trip cannot be planned in advance.  A lot of vacations are packed full of things that you chose to do while you were at home planning the vacation.  Then you get there and do those things and then go back home.  You know where you will stay since you've already made reservations.  You plan the day's activities because you don't want to waste any time while you are there and you've spent all this money. I guess its the spontaneity that is appealing to me about a trip like this.  Out of the 45 or so days I will be gone, I know for sure where I will stay for 6 of them.  The rest I'll figure out when I get there.  None of my meals are planned other than having stuff along to eat if I can't find a store. The outcome of the trip will be the result of many small decisions along the way, along with a lot of things that are out of my control. It will allow me to experience the places I'll be going thru in a much different way than I would have on a "normal" vacation.  That and I would never even plan to visit most of the places I'll be riding thru.  Really, who would plan to spend an entire day of vacation touring the desert of northeastern oregon....slowly..??  But, I'll bet that there are many things that will be worth seeing and doing there. Most vacations are about DESTINATION.  This one will be about journey. There, hows that for a sum up. People also ask me how in the world I talked my wife into letting me leave for that long, and really, I just don't know.  She will have to answer that one for herself.  Must be something about love. One thing I do know is that she is an incredibly wonderful person and has been way more supportive than I can believe.  This trip will be the longest we've been apart in 19 yrs of marriage. We have always tried to help each other achieve our dreams and goals.  Isn't that what marriage is about? Ok, ok, One last question and I'll shut up. Why are you doing it ALONE?? No great answer for that one. I really don't mind being alone at all, I actually enjoy it, although, I would really enjoy doing the trip with someone else too.  It just seemed to work out this way this time. For one, not many people have the desire to do something like this. Even fewer of them can take the time off work to do it, it is a long time to commit to and very hard to arrange unless you are unemployeed, retired, or are lucky enough to have a bunch of vacation to blow. So thats a pretty limited playing field right there and when you narrow it down even more by the number of people who would be willing to do it with ME.... ........wow...... where'd everyone go??  :)

The day started with the usual 12 mile ride to work, this time with the bike loaded for the trip. My brother Tim rode down at lunchtime and we had some good spicy Thai chicken to keep us warm for the afternoon ride in the rain. I worked really really hard all day :) and after a great surprise sendoff from work, complete with cake, McDonalds gift certificates, Starbucks gift card and balloons (I didn't ride with those) we headed out. Brad and Niels were the escort team taking turns out front for a much-appreciated draft into 10-15 mph headwinds. One thing I learned was that their mountain bike fenders were only meant to keep the rider dry, the person behind gets a nice shower, grit, mud and all, did I mention it was pouring rain the whole ride? It's Seattle springtime after all. Tim and I pulled into North Bend just before sunset, treated ourselves to a fat hamburger and fries and a rest. My wife Kathy and two boys, Kelly and Alex met us at our friend's house in North Bend for the night, drying out sitting by the fire was so nice. Thanks, Rick and Sue! (Editors note: I saw several camera's around, if anyone has some photos, please email me at: click to show email) More photos here
  The ride up Snoqualmie Pass is 2500ft in 22 miles, not a bad grade till the last 3 miles where it's pretty steep, that's where it started snowing. In fact, Thursday night they had 6 inches of new snow but most of it had melted off the roadway. Midway up the climb we came up on the scene of a pretty bad accident. It looked to be a multi-Barbie fatality and there were little clothes and Barbie parts spread out all over the shoulder. Bob pulled over and tried emergency CPR on the severed heads, but there was nothing that could be done but laugh of course and take silly pictures of Bike Seat Barbie and other nonsense. Really, we tried to be solemn, but it was difficult.     My good friend Jim surprised us, driving up for lunch with us at the top of the pass, probably not the last time on the trip he will show up unexpectedly, at least I hope.     It was pretty funny riding past skiers and snowboarders on a loaded tour bike.    Now the good part, downhill and 30 mph tailwinds the whole rest of the 55 miles to Ellensburg. Wow! There were times we were coasting along at 30-35, and the further we got from Seattle, the sunnier it got!        My parents drove over to spend the night with us. It's great to have such good friends and family. Hot tub at the motel was pretty nice also.      More photos here 
   Canyon rd out of Ellensburg south winds down a very cool canyon along the Yakima river.  A lot of volcanic rock along the canyon walls, columnar basalt.  Also nice to be under clear blue skies for a change.  Temps in the mid 50's feels like summer to us after yesterday.     Kathy driving the sag wagon again for the last day and my parents following for the winding, scenic 35 miles to Yakima.       Since I'm a bonehead and didn't think too far ahead, the cars and bikes got separated entering Yakima with no way to communicate with each other.  Bikes took a cool bikepath the final 10 miles and the cars spent time waiting on the side of the freeway, talking to a police officer who nicely but firmly told them to "move it or lose it" then agreed to go look for the wayward bikers. At the end of the bike path we headed across to one of the freeway offramps to start looking for the cars...I'm thinking this is going to be impossible, Yakima is a big busy town and we are 4 small bikes.  You can bet we were praying just a little. At the street light we were amazed to see them in a parking lot across the street...whew!! Lunch was sub sandwiches followed by a very hard goodbye.  I'll be gone 6 weeks, the longest Kathy and I have ever been apart.      Tears were turned into energy and I pedaled hard south out of Yakima, busy streets seemed to go on forever but after 6 or 7 miles I found a bit of a tailwind and was able to really cruise. The miles went by fast but my heart wasn't really in to the riding, I was really missing my family and the joy of the road was hard to come by.  I knew today was going to be hard.  It was. I got to Prosser right at sunset and began the task of looking for a place to stay.  A few nice folks directed me to the center of town and the police station where I was checking whether I could stay at the park...nope....there is an RV park outside town, try there. Finally rolled into the park well after dark and the office was closed, a note said find a spot & we'll find you in the morning.  It was definately under construction, no bathrooms, no showers, no nothing but there was a spot in the grass where I could put up the tent and cook dinner, I was happy. More photos here
Lots of farmland and vinyards, passed right by the Columbia Crest winery and was tempted to stop by for a sample but didn't. Big event today was crossing the bridge over the Columbia river and entering Oregon.  Not much of a shoulder on the bridge but very cool view 100 ft down to the river when the semi-trucks weren't flying by.  I spent the last 26 miles into Pendleton on the Interstate, not my favorite riding, but doable.  Its mainly the noise that bothers me, the shoulders are huge so traffic isn't a problem, just deafening. Got to Pendleton at 3:30 and saw the library and had to stop for an update. Weather was clear but pretty cold all day and now it looks like some high clouds are moving in, may be rain tonight.     
        
Lunch was at a cool town beside the railroad just before the Snake river. I was planning to stop for the night at Fairwell Bend state park but made it there by 2:00 and just couldn't waste the tailwind.  26 miles more to Ontario with about 1500 ft of climbing, the hwy just kept going up and down the 400 ft hills, I'd think I had climbed the last one only to find the road dropped the 400 ft again and headed up again. Finally made it to Ontario at 4:30 Seattle time, Hey, I rode my bike into a different time zone!!! Wind is whipping and the clouds are dark and threatening, rain on 3 sides of town so I wuss out again and find a cheap motel....there goes the budget.  Oh well, its only money.  Cold beans right out of the can for dinner followed by the 4th granola bar of the day for desert. Tomorrow its Idaho!!   
      
I've had beautiful blue skies for the past few days and great riding in the wide open Idaho countryside.  Its been great to be off the main roads for a while and see some of the rugged countryside.  I stopped on a bridge crossing the Snake river for a break and while looking down saw probably the biggest fish I've ever seen, didn't look like a salmon, more bulb shaped but was almost as big as I am.  It was at least as big around. Knee hurt again this morning but by noon it warms up and is fine the rest of the day. My daily schedule has been something like: up before sunrise (I know, I'm a sick monkey, I wake up at 4:30 or 5:00 and can't sleep anymore) Nothing to do but ride my bike everyday and eat all the food I can find.  Lately its been a granola bar and climb on the bike and ride 10 or so miles, stop for a huge breakfast at some small town cafe, ride for a while longer, I've been hitting 40 miles by 11:00am, stopping for a couple PB&J's, 50 miles by noon, stop at a grocery store for a bananna and yogurt or something and pick up a can of something to cook for dinner.  Ride till 4:30 or 5:00 and start looking for a place to spend the night.  This has been harder than I thought it would be.  My choices have been motels (love this choice but can't afford it too often), RV parks (nice to have a shower but they cost almost as much as the motel), and gravel pits :) free but kinda lonely. I'm still loving the ride and am getting a really spectacular farmer tan complete with raccoon eyes from the sunglasses.         
Made it to Burley and got a motel after finding that the next camping was 22 miles away, and yes, my knee was hurting and wanted a warm bed (whiner). Nice to watch the weather channel for an hour and CNN nonstop war coverage. Dinner was a can of chili with minute rice on tortilla's, when that ran out, I ate more tortillas and most of the granola bars I had in the pack.  There was a microwave in the room.       
Back on the interstate for a 12 mile ride to the Sublet rd gas station where I was planning to eat a big lunch, problem was that the cafe was closed and the gas station had almost nothing but chips and beer, I found a box of fig newtons and had a soda.    It was another 35 miles to Snowville with no services between. Bought a can of refried beans to have with the rest of the tortilla's...yum...and watched a great sunset from a very cool RV park named Lottie Dell, there was only 1 other camper there and nobody else anywhere around.  The office was run on the honor system, money into the envelope and thru a slot in the door, a phone there to use (not a pay phone, a real phone).  It kind of had an old log cabin feel, and there was a golf driving range you could use for free if you had the energy.  Hot shower and a few phone calls followed by another frosty night in the tent.  31 degrees at 6:00am when I woke up.       
Another banner day of biking with clear skies and temps in the upper 50's to low 60's perfect....except for that pesky 15 mph headwind. From Snowville I climbed a minor pass from 4500ft to 5300ft and dropped back down to 4700 ft where I rode at 10 miles an hour for 10 miles to another climb back to 5250 ft and another drop into Tremonton at 4400 ft, again at about 10 mph. One kind of annoying thing about Utah freeways is that the rumble strips are on the outer edges of the shoulder and run almost all the way to the right lane of the freeway so you either have to ride right next to the lane (a bad idea when the trucks go by), or get rattled to pieces on the rumble strip.  I did a lot of both, riding next to the freeway lane until a truck appeared in the mirror and moved over till they passed. Several other disturbing things: A) Truck drivers honk at you when you are stripping down to your bike shorts by the side of the road. B) Truck drivers honk at you when you pee beside the road. C) The truck drivers aren't girls....... And finally, the ANIMAL REPORT especially for Lauri: First the dead ones: lots of cats, 7 skunks, many deer, 2 dogs, 2 coyotes, lots of rabbits, and a bloated dead cow floating in the Yakima river. Now the live ones: The funniest ones are the cows, they ALL watch you as you pass, I mean ALL of them.  Its pretty spooky when there are 300 of them looking at you, its like they know you just ate a quarter pounder at McDonalds.  My favorite cow moment was about 30 young calves running away from me the same direction I was going, I rode beside them for about a minute until they had to turn because of the fence. The horses are 50/50, some of them look, others don't, the really cool ones run along beside you, thats fun. The Dogs....what can I say about dogs...I used to like them but its getting harder to maintain my fondness.  When you are on a bike you are a game to every one of them, without exception, every dog I see barks and tries to chase.  My personal favorite dog moments are when a pickup truck comes up behind you and the big dog leans way out and barks right in your ear as they pass.  You just know both dog and owner have a good laugh over a bud lite later in the evening on that one. Lots of hawks in the trees, they just watch you pass. Tim mentioned the huge fish, that was cool. More animal moments to follow. Ben     
Equipment report: I've had almost no problems with the bike, the last flat was in Haines, Oregon, already a week ago. I also feel I have all the right gear with me. The skies over Salt Lake City were brown with blowing sand, most of it blew into my eyes I think. I stopped for the night at a fancy schmancy Super 8 motel and took a nice hot bath and washed my clothes.  I headed down to the motel laundry to use the dryer but it cost $1.50 and right next to the dryer were the candy vending machines.  I returned to the room with still wet clothes and a bag of microwave popcorn...the clothes can hang dry. Another ANIMAL UPDATE!!!  Along the bike path less than 3 miles from the center of Salt Lake City I passed a large farm, maybe 10 acres.  The first thing I saw were about 100 chickens in a fenced area...remember, I'm in the middle of town, I've been riding in town for hours along busy streets etc. The next thing was a pen with about 40 goats (were talkin live animals now, not road jerky) The next pen housed a bunch of Ostrich, at least 10 that I could see with all that sand in my eyes.   
I didn't have a great nights sleep last night, something I ate didn't agree with me......or was it that sewer water from yesterday's photo?? Anyway, woke up at about 3:00 with a really bad stomach and...yes, I drove the white bus, sorry for the graphic sickness. I'm feeling better this morning, even ate the continental breakfast at the motel. They had do-it-yourself belgian waffles, wow! good stuff, ate a bunch of food. and of course more coffee. I'm debating on whether to try for the big pass today, snow is in the forecast along with high winds changing from the south to the west (that would help me since I'm headed south-east) The TV news weather report called for mountain winds gusting into the 60 mph range but didn't say where in the state that would be. Could be an interesting night if I decide to head up the mountain. This report will be a cliff hanger till I decide. Ben decided to continue on toward the pass last night. He pedaled about 1 hour past dark and finally made it to Soldier Summit around 8pm. He had a good climb, albeit through a snowstorm. There wasn't any motel around, but the guy at the gas station was nice enough to let him pitch his tent out back. He stayed warm despite temps into the 20-degree range. [Tim] ____________________________________________________________ Ben here, I called my friend Jim for some advise and encouragment, it was late afternoon and I knew I didn't have time to get up and over the pass at Soldier summit before dark but the forecast was for heavy snow overnight and I really wanted to cross before the heavy stuff hit.  Problem was that there was a cheap motel right across the street from the phone I called from. I headed over to the motel, still undecided and did a few laps around their parking lot making up my mind.....finally it came to me.....what would a CRAZY guy on a bike do??? RIDE ON and see what happened!! What happened next was a hail storm followed by a big drop in temperature and the snow started falling gently but large flakes. I kept riding upward thinking "I'll wait till 6:30 and then find a place to camp" 6:30 passed and I decided to ride till dark and find a spot. Dark came and the snow was still falling but not sticking to the road yet...I kept riding. An hour passed, still climbing and sweating like crazy even though the temp was below freezing.  It got to the point where I was a little worried about stopping anywhere without shelter to change into dry clothes. I finally made the summit and started looking for the motel....the one that had burned down 3 years ago I found out from Rob, the manager of the only gas station on the summit. He was nice enough to let me change in the bathroom, cook some dinner in the microwave and set up camp out behind the store.  Still snowing. Hit the sack wearing every scrap of clothing I had.
I ran from the tent into the store and filled up on hot coffee and junk food until the snowplows had the road cleared off enough to ride on.  Good time talking with Rob and the few customers that passed thru, including a guy named Tim who had just crashed his Bronco truck into the guardrail, it was his birthday.....happy birthday. I had been talking with him inside the store a little and I don't think he knew I was on a bike trip because a little later while I was out packing up the tent he came running over and shouted "Your that crazy guy I saw riding up the pass last night!!!  Thats the most amazing thing I've ever seen!!"  He got a little excited hearing about my trip and just had to give me something, he headed over to his messed up truck and came back with 2 big bags of candy and a $10 bill!!  Cool guy, thanks Tim! The ride down to Price was fast and cold, I hit the brakes anytime I got over 25mph because the road was still pretty wet.  A nice stop for a late pancake breakfast and hit the road again. In the town of Green River I stopped by the state park to check on campsite rates, they wanted $14 for a tentsite and I had just passed a motel that was only $20.95 so I headed back there and got a hot bath and caught up on the news and weather.  Tough choice right? Cooked a pot of chili and rice out behind the motel :) Typical weirdo on a bike.   
It was great to see my wife Kathy and son Kelly again after 2 weeks on the road. We spent the night in the Super 8 but have transfered to a small cabin at the RV park for the next 3 days. Its nice to have a break from the riding and catch up a little on the eating and resting. Its cold and windy here in Southern Utah, high of 48 degrees today when their typical daytime temps are in the mid 70's this time of year....just lucky I guess. Another animal update, while sitting at the park yesterday I had a visit from 2 Llama's who were busy mowing the grass. The ride from Green River was a magic one, nice and quiet off the interstate for the first hour on a deserted frontage road, never saw another person or car, plenty of lizards and 4 deer that ran alongside for a bit then crossed the road and sped away. The ride down hwy 191 was a special one for me since I've driven it so many times on other trips to Moab and it has very good memories attached.....even with the 15mph headwinds.   
Jerry took some pictures.  Click here  for the complete set of pictures.           
First town encountered was Monticello, butted up against another smaller mountain range and a big left turn to the east.  A stop for a soda and a couple of peanut butter & jelly sandwiches and start the gradual ups and downs along the high country for 26 more miles into Dove Creek.   This area is well known for growing a huge ammount of pinto beans, everywhere you look there is farmland.  Dove Creek is a small town but had a grocery store where dinner (angel hair pasta with a can of stewed italian tomatoes) was purchased along with a bananna for tomorrow morning.  I kept riding towards Cahone and realized that I had forgotten to fill up on water for the overnight.  One water bottle was all I had but Cahone was only 10 more miles, I could fill up in the morning. I made camp in a small stand of Juniper trees at the edge of a farmers field, great camp on the grass with the birds and turkey's my only neighbors.  At least I think they were turkeys, I heard the gobble gobble in the morning but never saw them.     
Well, I'm off for Durango and a crossing of an 8000 ft pass this afternoon.  Tomorrow I'll take a short day and overnight near Pagosa Springs to get an early start on the BIG climb over 11,000 ft Wolf Creek Pass on friday.       
I had a fantastic day. Sunny and 70 degrees with blue skies and even a tailwind! There was a bit of climbing getting to Pagosa Springs. Ended up with a shorter day preparing for the pass tomorrow. Stayed in an RV park in Pagosa Springs. I was in the mood for a real camp treat - hot dogs and beans, so I bought a can and got an 8 pack of dogs and buns.  Ate 3 in preparation for the big climb over the pass.   
    
  
    
I knew that I just needed to get to Keyes where I would turn east and the winds would be helping since they were out of the south-southwest.  I passed into Oklahoma somewhere along the way and got the typical new state photo by the sign...cool.  5 miles from Boise city there is a dirt road that heads east right to Keyes, I took it and went from working really hard for 6 mph to coasting on a dirt road at close to 15 mph, gave Tim a call while riding along and trying to stay out of the deeper gravel, that was fun. Had lunch in Keyes and found that my rear tire had gone flat while in the store, after lunch (PBJ's of course, and a bag of chips) I patched the hole and decided to stick with the old rear tire instead of changing to the spare for some unknown reason.  I am hesitating to put the spare on, not sure why. After a nice break I decided to try to make it the 50 miles to Guymon but could easily just camp by the road if I needed.  Out of Keyes there is 3 miles of south to get to the hwy east, another hard grind at 5 to 6 mph against the wind but flew along at 20 to 25 mph after turning east, fun stuff. I got to the Walmart in Guymon just at sunset and stocked up on snacks and bought a cheap $5 am/fm sports radio so I can listen to really bad country music while riding thru Oklahoma :) Also to be able to get weather info since I am entering big storm country. Got a cheap motel and ate dinner at a mexican place next door, menu in spanish but could make out that you could get your taco's with shreaded intestines if you wanted...I stuck with beef. Good dinner with great homemade chips and salsa followed by a soak in the motel room tub.  Much needed, I felt really grimey with sand stuck to my sunscreen'd skin. I'm still really enjoying being on the road, I've been pushing pretty hard the past few days to get a little ahead of schedule for the 19 day stretch to Nashville.  I know there will be bad weather or some other delay that will limit my mileage so its nice to get a little ahead of schedule early on.  After tomorrow I will be almost a full day ahead and can back it off a little. PS... Very cool photo Brendan, thanks!  It was probably too much sun and headwind but I couldn't help but think of Austin Powers with a Lance Armstrong body saying "Tailwinds are groovy baby yeah!"  yep, must have been heatstroke.   
Ben had hopes of going 100 miles so that he could be a full day ahead of schedule.  Instead, he had heavy winds and rain. He was able to keep ahead of the black wall of clouds for a couple hours but then it caught up with him.  He had just made it to a truck stop when the clouds opened up.  Even semi trucks were having to pull over because the rains were so hard and they couldn't see.  He stayed at the truck stop close to 3 hours waiting out the storm.  He had lots of coffee and friendly customers to keep him company.  The people of OK have been very kind and hospitable to Ben.  A preacher that came in said that he would come back later and make sure that Ben had a place to stay.  Ben realized that he only had about 20 more minutes of daylight and decided to go ahead and brave the elements when a woman came and asked him if he had a place to stay.  He told her that he was going to try and find a motel in the next town.  She phoned ahead for him and made sure that they had a vacancy.  They did!  He had 17 miles to go in 20 minutes before dark.  He made it there 45 min. after dark but God provided a full moon to light the way for him.  When he got there, the store owner next to the motel asked if he had had any dinner.  Ben said no so he said, "Let me heat up the fryer and cook you some burritos".  So after a crazy day, God provided a warm bed, a hot meal and a full moon to light the way.  Ben had also felt very fortunate not to have been caught up in any tornados that day.  There had been 6 sightings in OK that day and truckers had talked about seeing the tornado tracking vans on the road.  He also said that a tornado had touched down on a school house and ripped the roof off 70 miles south of where he was.
The sky was overcast but not looking as threatening as yesterday, the clouds were flying by along with many many tumbleweeds, some as big as my bike.  It was pretty funny trying to dodge them as I rode, hitting the brakes to let one go by or pedaling hard to get in front of one.  The wind was blowing across at a 45 degree angle over my left shoulder so when the semi trucks would go by they would block the wind for a second or two and since I was leaned way over against the wind it meant that the bike would dive left with every truck then get blasted back after they passed.  I got pretty good at judging when to correct but still ended up bouncing out onto the grassy shoulder a couple of times. One highlight of the morning was when I was coasting UP this gradual hill at 18 mph and could hear the trees behind me groaning and the whine from the powerlines went up in pitch all of a sudden and in about 5 seconds my speed went from 18 to 24.  That was while coasting uphill!!!!  Pretty wild morning. My speed averaged 21 mph for the 70 miles into Woodward, my planned overnight stop but it was only 1:00 in the afternoon and no self respecting crazy guy on a bike would quit for the day at such an early hour on a tailwind day!!  So I bought a bunch of groceries and headed back out on the highway. As the afternoon progressed the wind turned more from the north and my speed went down to 14 to 18 but still was able to make it over 130 miles in about 7 hours of riding, not a bad day!! The scenery past woodward was very nice also, going through a "canyon" (remember, this is Oklahoma) and past the Glass "mountains" (remember again, this is Oklahoma).......((the "mountains" were about 50 ft high)) but it was beautiful countryside.  I've really been enjoying Oklahoma, lots of green rolling hills and wide open views.  Its cool being able to see the next town coming 15 miles away with the big grain silos. I made it into Cleo Springs where an older man at the gas station recommended that I go to the rodeo grounds or fair grounds as he called it to spend the night.  It was a very nice small town, really nothing but residential and probably 800 residents, I found the rodeo grounds after 20 minutes of wandering around and set up camp back a ways in the trees in a nice grassy spot.  I don't think anyone in town even knew I was there, it was pretty and secluded being down a steep wooded hill from town.  The dogs even forgot I went by after a couple of hours of barking. :) Pasta with a can of Italian tomatoes and a snickers bar for desert, headed to bed by 9:00.   
Hey!!  Just because it's only noon and I've already had 4 servings of Malto-meal, french toast with syrup, a banana, 2 homemade cinnamon rolls (1 was so good I just had to buy another), and 2 cups of coffee.....I still haven't eaten lunch yet, boy am I hungry....  The bike shop owner Mikah says his sister-inlaw's bagel shop around the corner is his favorite spot for lunch.  He has been very helpful and will put the tire on and replace the chain while I wander around and visit the library. It was a beautiful morning, woke up at 5:00 and laid there listening to the very different sounding birds, thinking about how far away from home I am and just how lucky I am to be doing what I'm doing.  I rolled out before the sun came up and started in on a great breakfast.  One of my favorite treats after a big bunch of Malto-meal is to take a few slices of good bread, dip them in olive oil and fry them in the pan till they get good and crispy and dip them in syrup...yum yum yum, nothing better.  Very nice sunrise in a grassy green park, cool temps but a magic morning.  Wish they all were like this one.  Its funny how some days you wake up feeling so great, nothing you did, not for any reason it seems, just feeling fantastic.  That was this morning!!  Great to be out here. I rode the 35 miles into Enid, a fairly large town which means the nice highway I was on turned into a 2 lane tight busy grind thru town, people were cool though and went around.  I hate being a pain in traffic but sometimes you just have to take a lane for it to be safe.  I rode about 1/3 of the way over to the right, enough room for smaller cars to go by but the bigger trucks have to change lanes to go around.  Found the bike shop....really, its called "The Bike Shop"....cool.  I have a couple of hours to burn while its getting fixed up. More later, Ben  Because of a tip from a fellow tourer, Ben decided to change his route to avoid some headaches, both from bad roads and big cities. From Enid, he's riding north then east on I-60. He'll probably end up tonight in Tonkawa. His midday stay in Enid sounded exciting. He received quite the celebrity welcome at the bike shop, thanks to Troy. After dropping off his bike and hitting the library, he wandered around trying to find the recommended bagel shop. That ended when he walked past a pub and grill. While eating his rueben sandwich, he overheard an argument between two customers whether the San Juan ferry departed from Anacortes. This is in Enid, Oklahoma! He straightened them out. When he got back to the bike shop, Mikah only charged him for the parts, no charge for the service! He got a new tire, new brakes, new chain and full lube.     
 Several days back, Ben had a couple first-sightings: an armadillo and a snake (both roadkill). He's also seen several skunks. When I talked to him, he was just east of Ponca City on I-60, which has turned out to be a good route so far. Prior to crossing the Arkansas River at Ponca City, there was nothing but fields, but just after the crossing, the trees started to appear along with the rolling hills, reminiscent of Arkansas. Still at the top of every hill, he can see the next town 20 miles away and it never seems to get any closer. He expects to get as far as Nowata. I reminded him to fill up before town.   
Ben called last night from  Bartlesville, OK.  He went 87 miles that day but it felt longer because he was battling strong side winds the whole day.  He finished off the day at a motel, after making a pig of himself at an "all you can eat" Chinese restaurant.  He thought he was going to explode.  Ben called from Vinita, OK heading south. There is a tornado watch in effect, but he thought he might go on. He thought he might make it to Disney State Park for the night, or Jay.  My take on this is he is crazy (but you knew that): continuing to ride during a tornado watch plus thinking he will make it to the happiest state park on earth.  Ben called Kathy from Disney, Oklahoma, near the south shore of Lake O' the Cherokees. He intended to stay at the state park. He got a late start this morning due to thundershowers and hail, but was able to make it 65 miles. Later in the day he heard that there was a tornado in Bartlesville after he left. ______________________________________________________________________ Ben here, Actually a great day of riding after the thunderstorm stopped.  I had breakfast in Nowata and worked my way thru the rolling hills toward Arkansas.  I stopped for a BBQ dinner in the resort like town of Ketchum, lots of tourist type places nearby.  The lake gets a lot of vacation traffic.  They sold out on the BBQ rib dinner so had a hamburger instead and watched the weather channel reporting on the Tornado that was on the ground in Dewey, a town I had ridden thru 5 or 6 hrs ago.  Once again, shaving it a little close on the weather. I rode across the big dam and found my way to the Cherokee state park and spent 45 minutes talking with the camp host and his wife.....It was more like her talking and me listening than a real conversation.  She had to tell me everything about their town.  Really important stuff like the fact that Merle Haggard's brother lives there etc.  I wish I had thought fast enough and asked who Merle Haggard was....that would have been fun. Lightning off to the east as I set the tent up.  Looks like I'm right inbetween 2 major storm cells but so far am staying dry.     
Ben left a message at 11:43am CT. He made it to the Arkansas border at around 9:30 local time. He is north of his intended route, currently on hwy 72. Eventually he will pick up hwy 12. He has a nice but cloudy day with a little tailwind, and although he is not Catholic, he said he would be putting in some mass miles to celebrate Easter today. He will have to average 90 miles per day to reach Nashville on schedule.  Ben called Kathy at around 8:00pm CT from a motel in Huntsville, Arkansas. He had a great ride today and really enjoyed the hills and farmlands. He went 108 miles today. He had trouble finding the RV Park so he gave up and stayed at a motel instead. He ended up paying more than he had hoped so he had Rice-a-roni instead of pizza across the street. Kathy said he's still loving the riding believe it or not. ___________________________________________________________________ Got off pretty early from the state park at Disney, no rain overnight and the weather is looking good.  I stopped for groceries in Jay, not too far from the Arkansas border.  Another 2 lb package of peanutbutter sandwich cookies.  Had to eat a bunch before they would all fit into the handlebar bag. On thru Bentonville and a bunch of traffic, dropping south thru Hindsville and up over the hills to Huntsville for the night.  Nice crossing of Beaver lake on hwy 12, another redneck welcome yell, this time still unintelligible but with an arkansas accent.  Cool! Lots of big hills in Arkansas, the roads seem to wind around and around making the most of the topography, hitting every hill possible.  Climb one and immediately there is a nice winding downhill run heading for a gap between the hills but just before the gap the road turns and heads steeply up another hill.  Cruel joke by the hwy planning engineers. Entering Huntsville happens to be a fairly steep downhill.  I passed one motel hoping to find another a little closer to town so I could get some food without riding far.  Found a nice little motel right in town with a pizza place across the street. I rang the bell on the motel office door and a woman came and opened the door and talked to me thru the thick glass screendoor.  "Can I help you?" she asked, "I'd like a single room for the night" I replied.  She started shaking her head no and said "No, we don't allow bikes in the room".  "I can lock it up outside"  I replied still thru the closed glass door.  Very strange, but soon to get stranger. She finally opened the door and let me into the motel office and I filled out the paperwork, she asked me if I was a smoker, I replied that I would prefer a non-smoking room.....she said "No, I asked you if you were a smoker!!"  I said that I occasionally smoked a cigar in the evening but never inside.  "Our policy is to only rent no smoking rooms to people who don't smoke" she said.  I felt like leaving to find something else but remembering the steep downhill on the way into town I kept my opinions to myself. I got a smoking room complete with full sized fridge, stove, sink etc.  Even a big easy chair in front of the TV but kind of expensive, $38  for such a dinky small town.  The other funny thing was all of the Christian literature in the room, it made me wonder if she ever really read the bible, the religion came thru pretty strongly but the Godly love and humility sure didn't.  Could have just been a bad day though, who knows.  Since I spent so much on the room I didn't feel right hitting the pizza place so made rice-a-roni in the room and settled down in front of the TV for a while.  Life is still good!             
When I talked to him at 12:45pm CT, he'd just stopped for a snack at a gas station. In the background I heard a truck passing. He commented that it was a logging truck with the logs stacked sideways. As it passed he said "the tires are smoking like crazy, wait it's on fire, hold on". Then I heard him drop the phone and run. He came back a minute later and said the trucks tire was literally on fire but he was able to flag down the driver. He is planning to stay at a state park at Tyler Bend, a few miles before Marshall. It's unlikely he will be able to find the time to update this journal very much before Nashville.  Ben called Troy around 2:30pm CT. He went through a town called Mt Sherman. It never occurred to him that "Mt" meant MOUNTAIN which means climbing. The summit was 2200 feet. Only 4 miles beyond he entered Jasper at 800 feet. He said it was fast winding run down. He learned that one of the roads on his route is dirt, so he'll go North through Hasty. Although it will add about 8 miles overall, it will get him to highway 65 sooner. He still plans to stay near Tyler Bend tonight. ______________________________________________  Ben here, One really funny thing in Hasty that I really regret not getting a photo of was the sign for the Holiness church in Hasty......It said "Hasty Holiness Church"  I almost rode off into the ditch I was lauging so hard.  Wonder if they specialize in deathbed conversions.....Or could their motto be Slam Dunk? Not far out of Huntsville there was this really cool roadside stop, photo's below. Also did 5 miles extra trying to shortcut across a "low water bridge", it would have cut 11 miles off the day but ended up being 10" deep on the slippery roadway and flowing really fast.  I turned around when a guy in a jeep said he just about backed out after starting across. Just before Tyler bend state park you cross the Buffalo river again, then climb the 400 ft elevation up the other side, then turn into the state park where the road winds for 3 miles and drops right back down to the river again.....gee, thanks!   Very cool state park though.               
Ben stayed just outside of Marshall (don't know if it is before or after Marshall). He had a challenging day yesterday. Lots of steep hills and lots of dogs chasing him. Some were in packs. He never had to use his dog spray but came close with one dog.  1:00pm CT - Ben stayed at Tyler Bend State Park last night. He was very tired, but got a good sleep. Before bed, he was looking at the strange stars in the trees, which turned out to be fireflies (lightening bugs). He had to call me from Timbo, Arkansas. He is having a little better day today, the hills aren't quite so bad and no attack dogs yet. After buying a soda at the store in Timbo, the storekeeper said "you're going to Newport? You'd better start moving, you've got some hills ahead of you" (add you're own Arkansas accent). About an hour back, he passed through the town of Leslie, where he couldn't pass the  Serenity Farm Bread  bakery. He literally could not pass it without buying some bread, the smell was so good. He bought some walnut, raisin bread. His goal is to reach Jacksonport State Park tonight and at least the outskirts of Memphis tomorrow.  Ben made it to Jacksonport State Park, just outside of Newport. He had another difficult day with lots of hills and a long distance. He thinks he is back on schedule after his detour. He was on his bike 9 hours (not including breaks). At around 4:30, he realized he still had 40 miles to go, so he "sprinted" into Newport before nightfall. Actually, he did stop in the town of Oil Trough to pick up dinner. Of course they didn't have anything but a tiny convenience store. He tried to find a can of chili, but could only come up with a can of sloppy joe. When he got to the state park, he realized that the directions said to add hamburger meat, so he had bread with sauce for dinner, bad sauce. His elevation at Jacksonport is lower than his house in Everett: 250 ft. That means the Mississippi River drops 250 feet between there and New Orleans, 500 miles or so south. Tomorrow, he will make it into West Memphis and cross the Mighty Miss Thursday morning.     
  
 Ben called Troy at around 10:00am CT. He was still hiding out, but had eaten breakfast at a place called Grannies Soul Food or something like that. I think he probably stood out like a sore thumb. The guy cooking was named "Sonny". He said another 2 fellows came in with something large in a plastic bag and took it to Sonny. It turned out to be a big catfish.  The cook told the guy if he would clean it himself, he'd fry it up for him.  The rain passed and the sun came out in downtown Memphis. He rode down Beale Street, Ben called it "the blues capitol of the world". Said it kind of reminded him of Las Vegas but 70 years ago. Cobblestone streets and soul food. He rode past a donut shop across the street and just had to stop. He ended up spending an hour there because he met and talked with two guys, one owned a home brewery equipment store and the other owned a local outdoor equipment store. They bought him a couple donuts. If you haven't noticed, he's not making very good speed, but having a great time! He turned east on Union then north on Parkway. He's enjoying the beautiful urban scenery with tree-lined streets. His intended overnight stop was Bolivar, but the guy at the donut shop said that was the state insane asylum. Ben said that he might just fit in.  Ben called at 2:30pm CT from Eads on the outskirts of Memphis. He had a great ride along a great route (thanks to Troy). He lunched at the last possible BBQ joint he could find. He hasn't gotten rained on since the early morning and his shoes are almost dry. He's still planning to make it to Bolivar tonight, only 40 more miles.             
Out of Bolivar, hwy 64 turned into a skinny, two-lane, no-shoulder, just-try-to-stay-alive kind-of road. Usually the big trucks slow down and move over, it's the pickups with Confederate flags you have to worry about. Luckily it changed to a comfortable, divided, 4-lane, with shoulder highway just before Selmer. He's had nice weather, often cloudy and a little rainy at times, but no hard rain. His goal today is to reach the beginning of the Natchez Trace Parkway and stay at the Meriwether Lewis Monument Campground tonight. More info and pictures later.  Troy got a voice mail from Ben a while ago. He was in Savannah, TN just across the Tennessee River. Said a black thunderhead passed him by, looked like it went up to 40,000 ft. Fortunately, it had mercy on him. He said the wind is now mostly at his back and there are several smaller white thunderheads behind him. He had just finished a triple decker p-nut butter and jelly sandwich and a bag of chips. Looks like he has about 40+ to the Natchez Trace Parkway and then probably another 15 to the campground.  Ben made it to Meriwether Lewis Nat. Monument and had a great day!  He arrived at sunset after going about 110 miles.  He had hoped to go to a store before making it to the park but the store was closed.  He gets to have mashed potatoes and cookies for dinner. He is enjoying being on the Natchez Trace and has 65 miles to go till he gets to Troy's house. Ben doesn't know it yet but Katie is cooking steaks for them tomorrow and then they will rest on Sunday. Then Jim will join them on Monday where it will be back...on the bike seat...again.       
There was a group of youngsters riding bikes all over the campground, turns out that they were a scout troop, pathfinders, that were going to do a 50 mile ride south on the Trace today.  They ranged in age from about 8 to maybe 14, a pretty big day for guys that young.  They were VERY interested in everything I had and all I was doing.  It was very cool to talk with them about the trip, they had all kinds of questions and it was great to be able to inspire them and maybe broaden their ideas a little as to what was possible.  They had never heard of anyone riding a bike that far.  Good stuff! The ride was very scenic and peaceful, not very many cars on the road and I can't remember once where I had to bail off onto the grass shoulder to avoid being run over!!!  :)  Very different from parts of hwy 64 yesterday. One problem with the Trace is that there are very obvious mile marker signs every mile and I knew exactly what number was the last one 10 miles before Troy's house and it was impossible to ignore them.  I found myself counting them off and focusing on the milage more than the scenery and just enjoying the day.  I was pretty excited to get to Troy's and couldn't really ever settle into the good easy going pace where the miles float by while I'm enjoying the day.  It didn't help that I hadn't eaten very well last night and was running a little deficet in energy.  I pulled all of the food I had left out and calculated when I could eat what.  All I had left was 1/4 jar of peanut butter, 1 granola bar, 1 dried fruit snack, and a half a pan of angel hair pasta until later afternoon when I finished the Natchez Trace and turned onto hwy 100 toward Troys house. I got pretty hungry and could definately feel that I was low on energy. I called Troy as I approached the big bridge (photo below) and was 5 miles from finishing the Trace.  He arranged to meet me at the Shell gas station right at the junction of hwy 100 and would ride the 12 miles to his house with me.  A pretty big day for him after just running the marathon!!  What a stud! Troy brought a plate full of homemade cookies, a bananna, and an orange.  Add that to the 20 oz coke and super size snickers bar I bought at the store and I was feeling a little more human and thought I might just be able to make it to his house.  We ended up taking a really cool, extra long route thru Percy Warner park near his house, its a huge park with lots of hills and cool roads that curve their way around and thru the forest.  We stopped at the top of one of the hills for my first view of Nashville hidden in the dense forest in the distance.  It really is a beautiful part of the country, lush green and dense woods.  I do realize that I'm there during one of the better weather months of the year.  1 month prior or later and my impressions would probably be different. A great evening talking and eating vast amounts of food followed by coffee and more cookies and a big bowl of ice cream for desert and the evening turned into late night and then early morning before heading off to bed.  It was great to have a house to come to and such good friends to enjoy time with.  A very cool day!         
We had a big dinner on Saturday night, followed by a big lunch at a resturant called "Monells" I'm not sure if thats spelled right but it was a lot of fun.  Its a huge old house and there are tables that seat 15 people or so in different rooms.  You get seated with whoever else is there at that time and they start bringing big bowls of food that everyone passes around.  There is no menu but there are lots of choices of what to eat.  Pot roast, BBQ pork ribs, mashed potatoes, corn pudding, great biscuits and peach sauce (I had 4 of those) you get the idea. I took some time to add photo's to some of the more recent day's postings.  I still have more to go but will wait till I get home for the rest. We did a trip to the grocery store to resupply for the next week and spent some time sorting gear and stashing some of my cold weather gear.  I didn't think I had very much that I wouldn't be needing but ended up with a 10 lb grocery bag full of stuff that I don't expect I'll need.  Cool, I can carry more cookies and hostess pasteries that way. This is the first day I haven't ridden my bike since I left home a month ago.  It felt a little weird but very welcome. Now its time to go ride the Great Smoky mountains....first we have to get out of Nashville during the morning rush hour.  It will be great having Troy's company for the last leg and my good friend Jim will be joining for the first 1/2 day leaving here.  Good fun!
More news from the road later on today....stay tuned!!!  They just left about 9:00 a.m. CST.  It's a beautiful sunny morning, and looking to be quite warm.  Jim is going to ride 50 miles with them and then catch a ride back to Nashville.  Ben left a message in the evening. He had a good ride through Nashville, Troy picked a great route. Jim went 50 miles with them and Ben really enjoyed having him along. Ben and Troy went about 85 miles. Just past Smithville but 12 miles short of Sparta on Highway 70. They found a campground there (Hill Crest RV Park) and they were able to stay there for free. He said it was a little warm yesterday but they're having a blast. They left the campground at 7:00am CT.             
 Ben called at 5:30pm ET. They were hiding out from a storm that rolled in dumping rain and hail and filling up the streets with water. They had no other choice but to eat an early dinner at a hamburger joint.  Ben called Kathy at 9:40 ET. They made it to Lenoir City and are roughing it at a motel. They got in 1/2 an hour after dark. They went 95 miles today and are trying to go 90 miles a day for the rest of the week. They are hoping to make it to Savannah Sunday am verses late afternoon like originally planned. They had thunder, lightning and hail today. Troy is doing great! Especially for only 1 day off after running a marathon and not getting much riding practice in. Keep it up guys, you're almost there. They head into the Smokey Mountains tomorrow.       
 Ben left a message at 4:15pm ET. They had a good breakfast at an all-you-can-stuff breakfast buffet. After riding now for 60 miles, they were temporarily pinned down by the rain at the Sugarlands Visitors Center, the main entrance to the Great Smoky Mountains National Park. They have another 26 miles through the park with a 3,500 ft elevation gain over the pass, then down to 3,000 ft to the Oconaluftee Visitors Center on the North Carolina side.  Per Katie (thanks for the requested picture), they are planning to stop at a campground near Cherokee. That would be about 85 miles for today. Per Kathy, she's had some inquiries about the earthquake centered near Fort Payne, Alabama the morning of 4/29 (4.9 richter scale). Ben told her that it woke him up but Troy slept through it. They were sleeping in the tent that night. Now he has encountered just about every kind of weather condition except a hurricane and she prays that there won't be one waiting for them in Savannah. ______________________________________________ Ben here, As Tim said we had a great big breakfast but had to ride a little over a mile west to get it, then retrace back to the hwy.  It was worth it though, all you can eat!! The riding was very scenic, especially the cutoff from Townsend to the Sugarland visitors center.  The road winds along a narrow canyon with great river views and trees lining the sides.  Very peaceful and nice.  It did rain on us some but with the steep canyon walls and the wind direction we were able to stay dry for most of it.  Had to hide out once by the river under the big trees. It was a long haul to get to the start of the climb over the Smoky's.  60 miles to Sugarland with maybe 1500 ft of climbing, then from Sugarland its 13 miles and 3500 ft to Newfound Gap.  A pretty big day by my standards. We left Sugarland while it was raining lightly and thunder off in the distance, we pushed out the climb in a little over 2 hours and made the summit at 7:30, 45 minutes till sunset.  A short stop at the restroom, quick photo and its off to the downhill......well, a little downhill followed by more uphill...uuuggg....finally we make it to the big drop and rocket down the 2500 ft drop with large painful raindrops hitting your face as it starts to get dark. We rolled into Cherokee at 8:45 and started looking for a cheap motel, found one and asked about a resturant open late, the last 2 choices closed at 9:00 so we hurried over and walked thru the door of the Ponderosa Buffet at 8:55 and stuffed ourselves.  Good timing!  and the shower at the Motel felt great.                   
 So far today, they've experienced a few more hills than anticipated, but the weather is nice. When he called, he was at Tuckasegee on hwy 107. They've decided to alter the route slightly, eventually ending up on the west side of Augusta. They should make 90 miles today and will stay near Hartwell Lake just SW of Greenville, SC near Anderson.  Ben called Kathy at 9:47 ET and left a message. They made it to a little town called Townville (no joke). Today was a little tougher than anticipated due to the Nantahala Range but they had another good day. They hope to go 100 miles tomorrow, 90 some on Saturday, and 50 on Sunday. __________________________________________________ Ben here, We headed out from Cherokee at 9:00am and headed for Sylva and the really cool visitors center, photo below, where we tried for 45 minutes to decide on the rest of the route to Savannah.  Once again the route I picked out while in Seattle included 10 miles of gravel road up over a mountain, not great for loaded touring bikes.  The women at the center were very helpful and we soon had a good plan. At a gas station lunch stop in Tuckasegee one of the older local men was discussing loudly with another older gentlemen about all of the bicycle riders getting "KILT" on the road up Glenville Mountain.  It was pretty funny because he wasn't talking to us but was extra loud to be sure we heard.  He really thought his mountain was the BIG one and we were sure to die getting hit by a truck trying to cross it. He was right......It was a BIG climb, almost harder than Newfound gap, maybe because we really weren't expecting it, and the traffic was pretty sporty with narrow windy roads and lots of trucks. The road took us into a corner of the Nantahala national forest and right by a Thorpe lake at 3900 ft elevation.  Looked like a lot of vacation homes and the cars were all pretty expensive looking as they flew past. Our day of climbing paid off as we dropped out of the mountains on some spectacular banked corners, one right after another 25mph signs that we blew past at 30 to 40.  We didn't stop much because there were storms on 3 sides and we were heading toward the only blue in the sky. We rolled into a resort campground a half an hour before sunset $19 for a tentsite but there weren't really any other options close by and we were worn out.  Chili and rice for dinner and the sleep of the weary bike traveler.         
 Ben and Troy had a great day, no rain, temps in the upper 70's, mostly just easy rolling hills on nice roads (but not many shoulders). They were able to average around 14mph. He said the hills were arranged in such a way that from the top of one hill, they could see the next three off in the distance, maybe 1 mile apart. At about the 90 mile mark, they passed a campground, but decided to go for the 100 mile mark. Within a few miles of that decision, the thunderclouds began to surround them, at least on three sides. Just then, the road they were on turned right toward the only blue sky visible and they were able to ride the last 6-7 miles into Thomson dry. About 5 minutes after they got to the motel, the rain started dumping with thunder and lightening all around. They have about 140 miles into Savannah.   
      
Ben and Troy spent last night at the Dreamland Motel in Sylvania, had a big breakfast at an all-you-can-eat breakfast buffet right when they opened, then rolled out at 6:45am. They had a good ride into Savannah, 60 miles of mostly flat roads and sunny weather. It was quite hot at 80 degrees and very high humidity. Ben and Kathy will fly back Monday mid-day.         
Kathy and I went to "Shoney's" and had a nice big breakfast, at least I did, eating 2 normal breakfast orders plus half of Kathy's that she couldn't finish. We were flying Delta standby so we headed out to the airport at mid morning to catch a flight to Atlanta hopefully in time to get a connecting flight to Seattle in the afternoon. Flights were pretty heavily booked for the first leg to Atlanta and we waited until around 4pm before something opened up to Cincinnati, it was the plane we had been watching as the mechanics worked on it all day right in front of the window.  It was maintance delayed for most of the day and we ended up being 2 of the 7 people on the flight.  Whole jet was empty since all of the other passengers had gotten other flights out earlier.  Pretty weird! The connection to Seattle was fine after a 2 or 3 hour wait in Cincinnati and we ended up in 1st class!!  I could get used to flying like that! We landed in Seattle at 10:30pm local time and found our luggage, it had been there since noon so there was no delay waiting for it to be unloaded from the plane.  Our 17 yr old son Kelly picked us up out front and I was home and in my own bed by midnight. It was pretty strange being home after such a long time.  Didn't seem real that the trip was done but at the same time it was really nice to be home.  Mixed feelings are to be expected I suppose.  Overall I was just feeling very satisfied to have done the things I set out to do.  My route worked out well, the gear I chose did fine and I didn't really haul along anything I didn't use daily. Tuesday morning the alarm went off at 5:00am and I popped up trying to figure out where I needed to bike to today, I couldn't remember where I was and thought I still had 2 or 3 more days to ride.  It was several minutes before I remembered that the alarm was to get up for work and my bike ride was only 12 miles there and 12 home after.  All my stuff was set out last night and ready to go.  Pretty easy, ride 12 miles, hot shower and breakfast...Malto-meal in the microwave, free coffee....life is good....oh yeah, the work.....not that bad either. I'll be putting together some final thoughts and stats on milage, route, costs, weird body functions......all that stuff in the next few days. Also check back for more photo's soon. I'm glad it has been fun for you to follow along.  My thanks goes out to all who helped make the trip possible and such a pleasure.  Thanks to Tim for all of his fantastic work on this site gathering photos of my trip since I couldn't post them while on the road, and for gathering the information from whoever I happened to call and having it on the site in such short order.  It was fun for me to read the things he was writing and here I was the one doing the trip!! Thanks also to Troy for the many route and weather updates, and to Jim for the encouragment and help putting together the trip home. The most special thing about this trip was the love, support and encouragment from all of my friends and family, and also from the good people, strangers who I met that showed me kindness and helped with information and such.

Car tour.......It could be a dashboard fire, or spark plug wires getting a little hot, could be the old 8-track stereo finally shorted out, or maybe, hopefully it's that factory over there. Bike tour.......odds are pretty good its you, maybe 80-20 or 90-10.  Could be the factory but not likely,  hit the gas station bathroom and stick your head under the faucet.  Time for a little sponging off. _____________________________________ Hot burning rubbery smell Car tour........you could be taking the corners a little fast or braking too hard, slow it down a little Mario and try to enjoy the scenery.  It's the freeway, not the grand prix speedway. Bike tour.......Its definitely you, find a shower you dirty pig, and rinse out those socks for crying out loud, sheesh. ______________________________________ Exhaust, carbon monoxide, gassy odor Car tour.......Carburetor needs adjusting, running too rich, could also be a leak in the exhaust system.  Better get it into a shop soon and keep the windows down while driving. Bike tour......Whoa Dude!!!  Was that you??? Time to mix up the diet a little, sure those cans of chili are quick and easy dinner but back it off a little, try some pasta or a salad.  Man, that's really not cool, a little warning for the rest of the peloton next time.  _______________________________________ Rancid foul cheesy odor Car tour......what DID you do with that leftover half of the italian grinder sandwich from the other day.  Look under the seat and get yourself a pair of rubber gloves.  When traveling with kids it could be time to empty the dirty diaper bag. Bike tour.......time to brush those teeth, you know it couldn't be leftover sandwich because there's no way you'd leave a good sandwich uneaten.  If you used your toothbrush to clean the crud out of the rear hub, put it back in the tool kit and head for the gas station, use a little scrap of paper towel and some liquid soap.  Time to get creative with the oral hygiene until you can get to a BIG town with a walmart to get another toothbrush.  While you're at the walmart, grab a 2 lb package of those peanutbutter sandwich cookies, open the bag and eat 1/4 of them on the spot with a quart of chocolate milk.  Dump the rest of the cookies right into your handlebar bag and feel free to grab a couple while you are riding over the next few days.  You really need the protein.  Don't forget to brush often. _______________________________________ Clean, pine freshness Car tour.......its the air conditioner blowing past the little tree air freshener hanging from the mirror.  Be thankful you're in the front seat. Bike tour......its a pine tree, you are camping in the woods, its a quiet evening, the sun is setting and you've got that "life is good" grin on your face because you are in the .00001 % of the population that was lucky enough to be on tour today.  Soak in the feeling, enjoy life, sleep deeply and have good dreams.  I wish I could join you but the memories are still fresh in my mind and I'm smiling along with you. Ben Staley 
Prior to the trip I had estimated my daily costs to be $20 per day including meals and campground or motel costs.  The reasoning was that in the past I have done shorter trips where I ate Malto-meal for breakfast, snacked for lunch and cooked all of my own dinners.  The food costs were estimated at:  $2.00 for breakfast, $4.00 for lunch, and $4.00 for dinner.  I grossly underestimated the increased calories needed to support biking 90 miles a day, day after day.  I hadn't included any snack food costs for instance because on my previous trips I just ate whatever I had carried from home.  On the tour though I really needed those stops at Sonic drive in and the frequent gas station for coffee and a donut. I also had been reading everybody else's trip reports where camping in the city park was a normal thing and I expected a lot more nights of free camping than I actually experienced.  I think this was mostly due to me being on a route I made up instead of the standard  Transamerica bike trail. Most of the towns I inquired about free camping in, really didn't know what to do.  The police departments had never been asked about that before and weren't sure what the city ordnance was on tent camping within city limits. I really didn't do a very thorough job of looking for free camping because of the limited time I had to do it.  Most days I was riding until close to sunset and didn't have much time to search out a free spot, I took what was convenient. My actual cost per day EXCLUDING the extra expenses for my wife to fly to Savannah and back, her meals and rental car while there etc, came to $37 per day. I ended up staying in motels a lot more than I thought I would, both because of the lack of camping on my route and foul weather I ran into during the earlier part of my trip. My total costs by category for the 46 day tour rounded off were: Meals  $440 Snacks between meals   $120 Motels     $804  (23 nights) Camping    $117   (19 nights) Misc costs (including bike repairs)  $198 Airplane fair (standby on a buddy pass)  $312 I averaged 89 miles per day over the course of the whole trip not including the 3 days off mountain biking in Moab and the 1 day off in Nashville at Troy's house. My shortest day was 48 miles, which was the friday I left Seattle after working 8 hours.  My highest mileage day was 132 miles, and I had 10 days over 100 miles. Most days I was on the bike by 7:30 or 8:00 am and would ride until around 8:00 that evening.  I would take a lot of breaks during the day but usually none over 40 minutes or so.  Most were 10 to 15 minutes every hour and a half or so. My average speed according to the bike computer was somewhere in the 12 to 13 mph range.  It varied a lot depending on wind direction and terrain. I felt like the wind was mostly favorable on the west to east route although by far most of the days the wind was blowing out of the south.  I really don't think one direction has enough of an advantage to make it the primary consideration in your route selection. I chose to do my trip very early in the year for several reasons.  First on my list was that I really didn't want to be riding in the southeast in the summer heat and humidity.  Since I commute by bike to work year-round I am equipped to ride in the cold weather and really prefer a colder day to a really hot day.  Also the Northwest Church youth group mountain biking trip in Moab was scheduled around my son's spring break from school and I wanted to be there when they were. Looking back on it now I think I got pretty lucky with the weather considering the limited time I had to do the trip.  I only had 6 weeks to complete the tour since I was using saved up vacation from work.  It was pretty cold riding and camping during the first 2 weeks and prime storm time for the leg thru "tornado alley", and I didn't have much time to sit out bad weather.  Any downtime needed to be made up by riding longer days later. It was very nice to be riding in South Carolina and Georgia on 75 to 80 degree days in the sunshine instead of 90 to 100 degrees and humidity. I tried to keep the eating out to one meal a day and it worked out pretty well that way.  I could eat a big breakfast one day then switch it up and have a dinner out the next etc. I really enjoyed eating at the local cafe's or BBQ stands, whatever the area was well known for.  I tried to stay away from the national chains since I could get that food anytime back home.  I wanted to experience some of the culture and food of the area's I was riding thru. I really wish I could have camped more, my best nights were the ones in the tent.  The motels were more convenient on short notice, and its really hard to pay $15 or $18 to camp at a state park or RV park when there is a $23 a night motel with a hot bath and TV right down the street. On a tour where I didn't have a set finish date I would have been able to plan my route to hit more campgrounds and national parks instead of always choosing the direct route between 2 points.  Many times I could have ridden 8 or 10 miles to get to a campground but would have had to retrace the miles to get back on route and I just didn't have the time or energy. I would be a lot more likely to do one of the pre-mapped out routes now that I know more about the difficulty in finding free camping and all of the other day to day things you need.  Its fun to plan out your own route and there are many benefits of doing it but also its pretty hard to get good info on what services are available in the next town until you are there.  Either way is fun so its more a matter of where you want to go and what you want to see. Ok, this was supposed to be a statistics page, not a how-to book on bike touring.  I'll stop there and pick up on another page. 
So for the sake of science I'll tell a few secret details about what I experienced.  Sorry if its gross.  You didn't have to open the page, and you can stop reading now before it gets bad. I commute to work by bike year round, 12 miles each way, 5 days a week and do ride some on the weekends so its been a long time since I had the sore butt you get when you start riding after an extended period of time off.  I didn't have any problem with the general overall soreness like that. What I did have trouble with was ingrown hairs or something similar where the sides of the seat rubbed on my legs and .....well.....in the area behind your....ummm....yeah...and in front of your.....ummm....OK, this is a little harder than I thought it was going to be.  I think you get the idea.  Anyway, they were like pimples and hurt when you sat on them.  They get red and inflamed and really are a pain in the ass....really!!  :) They started during the first 3 days of the tour and I had them on and off for the entire 6 weeks.  I think I only had about a week of riding without some discomfort from them. Some of them in the area under the most pressure and rubbing from the bike seat would scab over during the night and then open up again while riding the next day. I started applying A&D ointment, a diaper rash cream, every morning before riding but it really didn't seem to help much.  Also it didn't seem to be hygene related , showering often didn't seem to change the situation. Several other people I've talked with have experienced the same thing, including 1 person who said he got the same thing from wearing crash pads for football in highschool.  Seems to be caused by the constant rubbing and pressure in a hairy area. I just dealt with the discomfort, it wasn't ever bad enough to keep me from riding. I've gotten some advise from a veteran bike tourist that either preparation H, or a prescription antibiotic cream is available to help with this problem. _______________________________________ Another topic, a little less personal, was knee pain. I had pain in my right knee for 2 weeks of my tour, right beside my kneecap on the inside of my leg.  It seemed to be the tendons or muscle that wraps around the knee and joins the upper leg to the lower leg across the inside. I know the day I injured it, pushing a little too hard up a series of hills at the end of a hard day and I was turning a little too much anger/frustration energy into pedaling energy and overloaded my muscles or tendons in that leg.  I wasn't spinning the pedals, I was forcing and pushing hard up a hill against a headwind and felt a little pain. The next day I knew I had hurt myself but the pain was managable and I started taking Ibuprofen at the max dosage listed on the bottle to keep the swelling down and hopefully speed the healing process a little. It was difficult to push down on the pedal without hurting so I favored my left leg when the right leg hurt.  I spent the better part of 2 weeks mainly pedaling with my left leg, just letting the right one rest during the powerstroke or downstroke on the right side. It really wasn't that bad, it didn't seem to slow me down too much except for on the hills.  Also, the pain would be less after I warmed up in the midday so I would use that leg carefully during that time and less in the morning and evening. One problem was that I was in Idaho, Utah, and Colorado for that time period...lots of hills including the climb over Wolf Creek Pass at the cont. divide. I think I got a rest in eastern Colorado and Oklahoma riding on the flat lands and the pain went away.  It never came back, and I never quit riding because of it.  I was still going 80 to 100 miles a day. ________________________________________________________________ Another problem I had from riding so much was a little change in bladder control, nothing major but..... From about the 2nd week on until the end of the tour I didn't get as much warning as I would have liked that it was time to find a place to pee. I would be fine one minute and all of a sudden....its time to go...like right now....countdown..10...9...8...7.... I like to call it a "drop the bike and run moment" Out on the open road it was no problem, plenty of bathrooms all around, everywhere and anywhere was fine.  In residential Memphis where it might be 5 miles to the next gas station it wasn't so cool. I don't think it was bladder infection or anything like that, I'm just not sure what it was. I kept trying to think of a cool way to rig an "on the bike bathroom" using a tube and waterbottle but never did try it. Could have made for a pretty embarassing and not to mention messy and hard to explain crash under the wrong circumstances. Hey.....it would have given me a fun little something to use on the dog chases, or the redneck welcoming committee (guys in trucks who swerve, honk and yell something you never can understand out the window).
Troy reminded me of a few to start with: Brian's Corner, in the panhandle of Oklahoma, A truck stop and gas station during one of the hairiest rainstorms (Tornado watch) I have ever been in.  The semi-trucks were pulling off the road because they couldn't see to drive.  One truck driver to another "Whacha haulin?.....Sheep......You baptize em?.....Yep" Same spot, I was talking to a ranch owner about the rain, I asked him if it was normal to get a months worth of rain in an hour.  He replied in a slow drawl "You know, we get around 18 inches of rain here a year.......an you can usually remember the day it happened" Countryside somewhere in Tennessee, a man standing by his beat up pickup-truck as Troy and I rode past.  "Man......I sure hope you boys don't get a flat"  I yelled back to him "Yep, that'd put an end to the trip right there"     Was it a warning? Was he wishing us success?, turned out to be more like a prophecy because I had 2 flats that afternoon, first one in 2000 miles, one more the next day and Troy had one also the day after that. 2 older gentlemen sitting in a store in North Carolina the day after we crossed the Smoky mountains.  They were talking to each other but obviously loud enough so we couldn't help but hear.  "You know a biker is gonna get himself KILT crossin Glenville mountain, he'd git hit by a loggin truck for sure" West Memphis Arkansas while waiting for breakfast at Grannies Soul Food Cafe.  The cook Sonny was back in the kitchen making my bacon and eggs when 2 guys come in with a big catfish in a grocery bag and yell for Sonny.  He comes up to the counter, looks in the bag and says "Nope, I ain't gonna take it....you boys go clean it an I'll cook it up for you but I ain't cleanin it...no way....I ain't got time fo that" On a small side road in Arkansas after turning back on a short-cut over a low-water bridge that was flowing too fast for me to try.  A man in a pick-up stops and is just looking at me funny.  I asked him "you think I could have made it across?"  (It would have cut about 10 miles off my day).  He ignores my question and asks "where you ride that from?" I told him "Seattle Washington"  He shakes his head, furrows his brow and says "I can not imagine" and drives off. I stopped at a gas station in Arkansas for a soda and bag of chips to eat with my peanut butter and jelly triple decker sandwich for lunch.  The usual crowd of people forms and they are talking and asking questions, 3 of them are young men who are joking around with me and each other.  They ask where I'm headed, I tell them Jacksonport state park, 60 miles down the road and they are sure there's no way I'll make it before dark.  I say goodbye and head back out to my bike, look around and since there isn't anywhere good to sit and eat I pedal about 4 miles down the road and stop at a church. I'm eating in the shade under a tree when this big truck pulls up.  Its the 3 guys from the gas station and the driver leans out the window grinning and yells   "Boy you better git on yor bike an ride, you'll never make Jacksonport doin' that!!" I'm in Walts Corner, eastern Colorado, I've ridden 35 miles from Trinidad in some of the most remote, empty country anywhere, I was stupid and hadn't filled up on water while in Trinidad, I'm almost empty and there is another 40 miles of wasteland to get to the next dot on the map, a very small town named Kim. Walts corner isn't even a gas station, in fact its nothing but a counter with a fridge behind it and a doorway into a room where the owner is selling his artwork. Paintings of naked women, bronze castings of naked women, wood carvings of naked women etc.  I go in with one waterbottle and ask his wife (not a naked woman thank God) if there is a spot I could fill it up.  She says "We can't give you any water, we don't have very much........a long pause......we do have bottled water you could buy" and she opens the fridge up, its full of bottled water and soda.  I buy a small bottle and a can of coke for $1.50 and head off toward Kim. 
The fun started as soon as we connected with the Orchard Loop trail and began the downhill run. I went first and did my imitation of a human weed whacker for the first two hundred yards. Just a month ago I cruised down this same trail unmolested. Today I was grabbed by hundreds of leafy green arms, clinging to my shirt and bare legs, tensioning and snapping away as I rode downhill. I came to a wall of trail-blocking Oregon greenery and made a quick stop. I had to use an arm to push through a mess of downed tree limbs and sticky blackberry bushes.  The trail became clearer as it rolled under the old-growth section, fast and fun, packed hard, but still a little damp so traction was excellent. We screamed down, making the most of bumps to gain airtime. It was over too quick and we began the ascent up the south contour leg of the Orchard Loop.  A quick five-minute climb and Ned passed me as we began lap number two. I planned out my strategy for the trail-blocking bush and made the best of it, bobbing and weaving under and around the reaching vegetation. It went smoothly and I quickly made up time on Ned on the descent. I passed him as he went wide at the entrance to the climb. We huffed uphill, both in our big rings. I was about to shift down as Ned faded behind when I saw a woman runner up ahead. My ego kicked in and I stayed on my feet, passing her carefully ('On your left'), and winding around the hillside and out of sight where I could finally downshift to a more reasonable, less quad-burning position.  I peaked and strategized for my final pass at the main trail obstacle. I imagine cyclo-crossers use the time they spend climbing, or spinning flat sections, to think about how to set themselves up for the obstacle crossings. I had a plan. As I closed in on the spot, I kicked out my right heel, releasing my shoe. I steered to the right edge of the trail and put my foot down just at the rim. With my right hand on the handlebars, I reached out with my left to lift the bushes. This was the crucial moment of my plan. There was a brief pause where it looked like it might all work. This was followed by a longer moment where I knew it was not going to work and that all of the flailing I was doing was not going to stop me from falling downhill into the blackberries. Which I did.  Ned eased past laughing.  I self-extricated. It took me a couple of minutes. I hear it's illegal to self-extricate in 39 states and three others if a minor is present. We took Springwater back to town, splitting up in Sellwood. The cool breeze from the West felt nice on all the stinging spots on my arms and legs. Hopefully the shower will help too.  Next Friday it's the Giro Delle Colline ad Ovest, which I think means tour of the west hills. Mountain bikes again. Email if you're free. I don't think I'm going to invite Ned.   
I wanted a break from my usual in-town rides in Forest Park, and I was looking for a route that would offer lots of climbing. My plan was to ride out to Powell Butte and then try and connect to Rocky Butte using the bike paths and streets on the east side of Portland.  There was a strong headwind all the way out the Springwater Trail Corridor, or, as it may be more aptly described, the Hobo Highway. I was only hit up for money once on the ride out. What can I say? It was a beautiful sunny day and I made eye contact with everybody I passed. I guess someone was bound to put the touch on me.  Powell Butte was relatively dog free-chased by two, barked at by four today, rightly or wrongly, all of the dogs had owners in sight-and I climbed up the Orchard Loop Trail, taking the east end of the loop to the 640-foot summit. The view of the city was nice from the old apple orchard on top. After a moment on the park bench and a couple of oh-zees (Ed. Note: I use phrases such as 'oh-zees' and 'long-travel equipped' because I know that when Sarah reads it she'll roll her eyes, feign disgust, and say, 'You're such a dude.' It's a nice counterpoint to my teenagers who often observe, 'Dad, you're such a dork') of fluid I was off for the most fun part of the day's trip, single track!  I clipped in and started down the trail, picking up the west end of the Orchard Loop. I pressed the electronic lockout button near my left grip and felt the damper release in the Cannondale Lefty; I was now in full suspension. Slipping down the hill, I picked up speed, the suspension system smoothing out the terrain, keeping the wheels in contact with the ground as I rolled over rocks, roots, and ruts. On the climb up I had seen that trail crews had recently been busy up here. As I descended I could see more evidence of work party contributions to trail maintenance and hillside preservation.  The trail was in beautiful condition, aided by a couple of dry days. I rode quickly over the grass-lined ruts of the meadows on top, down the contour-hugging ravine section and onto the flat, wide needle padded path through the park's old firs. I used the disc brakes as little as possible, trying to maximize my airtime on the descent. The slaloming downhill run was over too fast. I picked up Ellis Street after a five-minute descent, dampened my front fork, and was off for Rocky Butte. I connected with Powell Boulevard and turned west toward I-205. The section of Portland's 40-Mile Loop bike path that I traveled alongside I-205 was quick and easy traveling. Once I made Burnside I used the nineties-94th, 92nd, 89th (not technically a ninety, but a really close associate)-to work my way up to the Great Wall of I-84. The nearest freeway crossing was 82nd which gave me the adrenalin rush that only a live action version of slot cars can offer. It was me versus dozens of harried, pissed-off mid-day drivers. I hung in there for a half-dozen blocks before bailing out on Tillamook and heading back up to the nineties on the other side of the freeway. I picked up 92nd and rode north to Rocky Butte Rd. where the climb to the top of this Northeast Portland landmark starts.   It's a quick pedal to the top and I like the way the road winds through the tunnel and then back up over the top of itself. The ride uphill was warm, with the east wind blocked and the sun shining on my back. I decided to take off my windbreaker. Without stopping. Not a good idea.  I can ride uphill with no hands. I can ride uphill on my mountain bike with no hands. I can also wave an arm around and ride uphill. What I can't do is ride uphill with no hands while waving both arms around, which is why my windbreaker now has a custom ventilation job in the left armpit.     I got a foot down and managed to dismount before crashing; however, I jerked my left arm while trying to catch my balance, at the same time the left sleeve was half off, resulting in a seam-parting that went out two-inches in each direction from armpit central. I like the new feature. However, I think I'll find a less exciting way to add ventilation to the right armpit. As I rounded the last bend and the top of the hill came into view I could see a guy waving his own arms around and jumping up and down on top of the stonewalls that crown the hill. He didn't have a windbreaker. As I got closer I could see the jumper-waver guy had a telescope set up and was spotting planes at the airport. He'd see a plane and get all excited in a manic, talking-to-himself, stalking around sort of way. I would have been nervous, but it was the middle of the day, there were lots of people around, and I've seen just this sort of obsessive-compulsive passion before.  When I traveled across the UK by train I was seated next to a couple of Welsh train-spotters. They would start to talk about the trains they had seen here and there when they traveled the country and they'd get all excited and start waving their arms around in short, controlled, staccato bursts, like an infant trying to get your attention from the car seat.  I was really disoriented by the train spotters, mostly because I had no idea that this sort of thing was an actual hobby. They were speaking in a mish-mash of Welsh and English, which didn't help my understanding at all. I'd catch about every tenth word or so, and initially I thought they might be escaped lunatics.  Further complicating things was that, while I was certain they were speaking complete gibberish, they seemed to understand and respond to each other's blatherings in a completely average way, as though two guys were speaking perfect English and discussing the weekend's football result. I could only watch sidelong and fascinated, certain they were occupying the same insane universe.  When I got to Dublin and related the whole surreal experience to my mates there, they laughed their butts off at me and then explained the concept of a hobby that requires you to spend your holidays traveling around the countryside, keeping a log of every train you see.  Thrilling. After a few more completely unselfconscious rantings, Mr. Plane-Spotter seemed to calm down. I put my newly modified windbreaker back on and tucked the downhill run back to 92nd. The winding trip through the tunnel was quick and fun. I used eastbound streets to reach 60th where I cut over to Stark. There, looming under a dark blue grove of Doug fir was Mt Tabor. As soon as I saw it I knew I had to go for the trifecta of Portland peaks. I was up and down in about fifteen minutes, with Powell to win, Rocky to place, and Tabor to show. I headed down Stark, across the Hawthorne, and south on the Greenway trail toward my home in John's Landing. After three hours of pedaling I was dreaming about pizza and mustard drenched sausages, the food that a bike ride inspires, when I spotted Papa Joe's Sausage and Hot Dog complex. I imbibed in one of Padre Jose's (yep, dude-worthy, you're getting it now) finest double smoked sausages, accompanied by a handful more condiments than it was designed to hold. I don't know the technical-side of what makes a sausage double smoked, but I know that one of the reasons I ride is so I can eat food like this. I highly recommend it; he's about two hundred feet south of the Spaghetti Factory parking lot. Tell him Greg-the guy on the bike-sent you.
The lawn at our house is very small and easy to mow. I have been using it as a cover, taking ten minutes to mow it and another ten to rake. Twenty minutes of manual labor, the house looks transformed and I've got my warm up underway for the day's biking action. I confessed to my use of the lawn as a quick easy chore to cover for my recreational intentions in an article I wrote for Oregon Cycling, and she's been on to me ever since. Now I have to find another way to appear responsible while trying to maximize my fun time. It seems to me that although the truth may set you free in some metaphysical sense it will not set you free to do more cycling.  Fortunately, Sarah was heading out of town to attend graduation ceremonies for a niece and nephew. The coast came clear around ten-thirty. So I set aside the list of domestic chores she had created for me in our compromise (in this case, compromise means I get caught and end up with more things to do) and headed out the door with the road bike. My goal today was Crown Point. I rode downtown and dropped off a rim that needed some professional attention. Then it was over to the MAX stop and aboard for Gresham. MAX can be fun and entertaining and some times it can be just annoying. I managed to catch a train quickly, which seems to be the case during the day. They run frequently and it is predictable that they will only be full during the daily commute and after ball games.  What's not predictable is who your traveling companions will be. Today I rode with two dogs. Not really dogs, like ruff-ruff, but two high school kids, bragging about the fact that they were skipping school and beginning each thing they said with, 'Yo, dog.' That was the annoying part today.  The entertainment came when a sixtyish-looking man got on the train while one of the dogs was hanging off the overhead handrail. He looked at the kid, pointed at the sagging pants and said, 'You're gonna lose those.' To which the dog responded, 'Whuh?' This is how kids respond when they want you to say something over again. Everything sounds stupid when said twice and the time it takes to repeat gives the dog a chance to think up a witty reply. My years of teaching high-schoolers taught me to respond to 'Whuh?' with an add-on statement, pressing the advantage. Unfortunately, the older gentleman walked into the trap, thinking the kid hadn't heard him. Given time to gather his thoughts, the dog riposted, 'Wha choo lookin' fo'?' To his credit, the old guy gave up and chose a seat facing away. Two stops later the dogs got into a discussion about when the Rose Festival was over. Dog A turned in my direction and said, 'Yo, dog. When's the Rose Festival over?'  It took me a moment to realize I was the dog on the spot. I thought about turning and replying, 'Whuh?' Or I could just answer, but then, would I be part of the pack? Too much time passed as I weighed my options and studiously examined the little rubber nodules that stick off the side of my bike tire.  Then, in a polite suburban youth's voice, I heard, 'Excuse me sir. Do you know how long the Rose Festival runs?'  I had to turn and answer that one. I looked at the Gresham-bound youths, dressed in Bronx-bound threads, and I told them, 'I believe it runs through Sunday.'  Maybe I'm not so smart about kids. Maybe it's comforting to belong to a group, to have the security of a pack, when the world seems like a scary jungle.  Whatever judgments I had about the way they dressed, spoke, acted out, I had to put them aside and admit they treated me with the same respect I showed them by allowing them the space to do their thing. I may have been judging them, I may have been annoyed, but keeping my composure and keeping my mouth shut can sometimes be the best thing for me to do, to add to the peace in the world. I rode the train out to the 181st station where I disembarked, saddled up and started pedaling east on Stark Street. It's a quick ride out of town from there, with a nice wide bike lane. I rolled down the hill and across the Stark St. Bridge over the Sandy River, where I picked up the HCRH and turned right. The climb starts immediately, up a gentle hill to Springdale and then more of the same, on to Corbett. The shoulders are a bit narrow in places, but traffic is light and the road winds up hill through the trees. The cars that pass don't seem to be traveling too fast. There is a lot of gravel left over from winter and quite a bit of broken glass. The street could use a good sweep, but I was able to dodge the hazards in relative safety.  I stopped in Corbett at the General Store to fill my water bottles. In making my joyful escape from domesticity, I'd left with both bottles dry. The woman in the store said the state health inspector won't let her give out the water from the sink behind her counter. She showed me where her hose was outside and I used that instead.  I appreciated the help, but the only thing worse than water that has been in a plastic bottle too long, is water from a plastic bottle that has been in a hose too long. I thought I let it run enough to clear out the hose, but maybe that isn't possible. I got a couple of swallows in my mouth and carried on up the highway.  Between Corbett and Crown Point I broke out of the forest and caught my first sight of the river. The view from the Women's Forum scenic overlook is incredible, green on both sides of the gorge and the islands in between all filled in with the mighty Columbia rolling along to the sea.  The Larch Mountain cutoff is just after the Women's Forum pullout. Signs were out up and down the highway announcing a race June 16th. The woman in the store asked me if I was a racer and mentioned that the race was happening on Father's Day if the snow melts on top of the mountain. A mileage sign reads: Larch Mountain 14. There's an orange warning sign that reads: Gate Closed Ahead 10 Miles. From the Larch Mountain intersection it's a quick downhill run to the Crown Point Vista House. Today there is a mobile trailer serving as the information center and a chain link fence surrounds the Vista House. There is a crew working on the refurbishing of the building. It looks like it will be spectacular when they are finished. I would have liked to hang around ask questions about the work, but as I sat on the old wall overlooking the river and ate my yogurt bars, I saw rain headed my way.  I washed down the last of the food with some plastic flavored water and started the pedal back to town.  It was a quick climb to the Women's Forum and then back the six miles to the Stark Street Bridge. I averaged around twenty-eight mph-topping out at thirty-five-for this portion of the return and was greeted by a blue patch of sky as I came out of the trees and crossed the river. The climb up from the river is steep and I was nice and warm by the time I gained the plateau near Zim's. With about three miles to go to the train station, I began to feel the first drops of rain from the advancing front.  I shifted up to the big ring, pushing hard into the wind and light spring rain coming into the right side of my face at an angle. A couple of gusts pushed me to the left edge of the bike lane. I managed to run at about twenty mph down to 181st, where I turned right and arrived at the MAX station as the inbound train was also arriving. I think the driver might have held the door for me as I stuffed the change and ticket into my hip pack and quickly boarded the nearest car. The ride into town was quick and quiet, the train steadily filling up with people (no dogs near me this trip), most of who appeared to be teenagers on their way down to the Rose Festival Fun Center. I got off at the Rose Garden stop and rode down to the Eastbank Esplanade, where I picked up the path and crossed on the Steel Bridge. The west side of the river was lined with Navy ships and the Esplanade was fenced off for security.  I rode up to Fourth Street and stopped at Seattle's Best for a mocha to warm me up. The little chocolate stick that goes along with it gave me the kick I needed to finish the last three miles down the Greenway and home. The lawn looked nice. If I didn't know better, I'd think the guy who lives in this house is a responsible citizen.   
We met a couple a few years back that had ridden a tandem from Alaska to Southern California, and then across the country to Florida.  It seemed like maybe the tandem was the way to go.  So in November of 2000 we bought a tandem and started riding it without any definitive date for this big trip. Last summer we did what we thought was a lot of riding and rode in the STP a two day ride from Seattle to Portland.  That was fun, but Mary was having problems with her knees.  It was looking like the tandem trip across the country wasn't going to happen. Luckily, Mary started seeing Julie Johnson, a physical therapist, who specialized in bicylcing.  After spending most of last fall working through knee strengthening exercises, and figuring out the correct riding position, it looked like the trip was back on for summer 2002. We started training the first of the year, with the goal of increasing weekly mileage 10% a week until the first of June.  We started with a little less than 40 miles a week and have been steadily increasing it. Most of January, February and March we've spent riding in the dark after work, and getting two longer rides in every weekend.  We're both looking forward to daylight savings time when we'll be able to get most after work rides done in the daylight. In addition to the riding we've been making sure everything at home is taken care of while we're gone.  We have the mother of a guy I work with coming out to house sit, and more importantly cat sit.  She was in town in mid-March and Mr. C and Sparky seemed to think she was okay. We still have to figure out our options for getting the tandem to the East Coast.  It is a large item to ship so we'll probably have to send it well in advance of us.
Our training has also been a great learning experience.  All along we've been thinking that we would carry all of our gear in painiers.  The B.O.B. seemed like an option, but a ten foot long bike didn't sound too great for 4000 miles.  Our first over night trip in early April put an end to the painier route.  We did a nice 120 mile weekend, spending the night at a state park.  The fully loaded painiers caused a lot of frame flex and I couldn't really see riding the bike all the way across the country like that.    We came back from that trip and immediately bought a B.O.B.  A very good decision.  Riding with our gear in the trailer makes the bike seem unloaded, and the length doesn't seem to be an issue. It's hard to make sharp turns with a tandem anyway, so the extra length doesn't alter the way we ride. The additional bonus of having the B.O.B. is we'll be able to go mountain bike camping when we get back from this trip.
We've been doing most of our rides with the B.O.B. trailer on the back of the bike.  It was a good purchase.  The bike doesn't even feel loaded when its on there and its a lot easier to access our stuff.    We also aquired a full compliment of Polar water bottles.  It seems a little silly to worry about insulated water bottles when you've been riding in 40 degree temperatures, but I think they will come in handy for this summer. It looks like we've got most of our arrangements done for shipping the bike back east, and having all of our bills paid.  Sometimes it seems like the training is the easiest part of the whole trip.  It's getting all the other things in order that take all of our time.
We've also discovered that our bike needed a few fixes before starting out on this trip.  Buying a used tandem was a great decision, but some things have started to wear out.  We have no idea how many miles are on this bike, but we've put close to 4000 on it. Both our rim sidewalls are getting pretty thin, so.... We decided to bite the bullet and have some hand built wheels made for us.  Nothing like spending half the cost of the bike for a wheelset, but hopefully it will eliminate any potential issues we could have in the middle of the country.  The guys at Seattle Bike Repair have been really great, and are making time in their busy spring schedule to get these done for us ASAP. In addition to fixing the bike up, we've got a name for our bike, "Klickitat Touche".  Don't ask. We've also got a top five list of places to ride from Freemont (not).  We're beginning to feel like experts on where to ride and not ride in the Seattle area: 5. Anywhere in Bellevue -- they don't believe in shoulders or bike lanes. 4. Burke Gilman trail on a sunny day -- more like dodgeball than riding a bike. 3. Pioneer Street in Gig Harbor -- approximately 28.2% grade. 2. Sammamish River Trail during a walkathon. 1. The one mile section of the Burke Gilman trail South of Logboom Park (towards the UW).  The most consistently bumpy piece of trail known to mankind.  This is best at night. We've also found some great places to ride.  Vashon Island is amazing.  No traffic, and the ferry ride is a perfect time to take a short break.  Magnolia has a great bike lane and was perfect for shorter mileage days.  Kopachuck State Park is also great for overnighters.  The biggest surprise is how nice the riding in Renton has been. Only two weeks until we ship the machine.  Yeah!
The bike was shipped June 4th and it's been strange without it around.  The freight company thought it would take nine days to get to Lynchburg, VA but they couldn't guarantee that so we shipped it very early.  Hopefully the rest time before the trip won't kill us.  We'll have to do a lot of mountain biking. The guys at Seattle Bike Repair took care of the packaging and shipping.  Hopefully the people at Bikes Unlimited in Lnychburg will take as good of care of the bike for the few days prior to us picking it up.    We now have a lot more time to get the last minute things done before heading off.  I've been to AAA to collect state maps and trace our root.  It helped to get a broader perspective than you get from the Adventure Cycling maps.  We're not sure we'll actually pack the AAA maps, but it was fun to trace our route out. Just a little more than a week of work.  Then we get to spend a nice week with Mary's parents, and away we go.
  Finally we're off.  It seems like we've been talking about this day forever and its finally here. We left Lynchburg close to 10am.  We were orginally going to start from Yorktown, but due to circumstances out of our control we had to make some last minute adjustments, hence, we're making our own route up as we go. We took the blackwater creek trail out of Lynchburg.  We had to do a little pushing the bike up a dirt road.  We also had to carry the bike and all of our gear over a gate.  Of course as soon as we got all the gear back on the bike a guy showed up who could open the gate.    Next we hopped on route 622.  It was good choice; little traffic, some hills and great scenery.  Stopped at a little mini-mart about 15 miles into the ride.  Had a nice guy ask where we were going.  I said 'Seattle, eventually.'  He just asked 'How come?'  Couldn't really give a good answer.    At route 60 we headed east for about two miles, then caught route 605 to the park.  The last couple miles were surprisingly uphill.  We thought since the park was on the bank of a river it might be downhill for the last bit.  No such luck. It isn't too hot and everyone we've met has been very friendly.  The park ranger invited us into his booth to cool off to discuss our camping options. We had a nice campsite next to the James River.  For some reason, the only other people camping in the park pulled into the site next to us.  They had a nice loud generator and two bassett hounds that liked to bark.  At least they took the dogs in for the night. The only downside to the camping area.  No showers.  We've got a nice funk going on.  Hopefully there will be showers tomorrow. Quote of the day - "That's a cool bike, Mom!" - little girl riding with her Mom on the trail. 
We had learned from the park ranger that our only choice for getting back on the road we needed was to backtrack about 12 miles.  Bummer.  Never trust mapquest. 20 fun miles later we were 1/2 mile from where we had camped, just across the river. We cruised along going through the 'towns' of Norwood and Wingina.  Both of these places were just post offices, not really towns at all.  At least the post office in Wingina had some water we used to fill our water bottles. We ate a little snack on a bridge at about 30 miles.  About halfway through eating we started hearing some noises in the water under the bridge.  Lots of splashing.  We didn't stick around to see what it was.  Could of been a cow or something.  It was making a lot of noise.    We stopped at the market in Howardsville to each drink a pop and enjoy the A/C.  It was starting to feel hot outside.  We talked for a while with a guy who was wearing a ton of UVa periphenalia.  Turns out he went to Virginia (big surprise). We then went another 15 miles to Scottsville.  Nice campsite next to the James River again.  The proprieter said it was 103 in the sun.  Mary heard it was 92 in the shade.  No wonder it felt hot.  Luckily the campground had showers.  The funk was getting pretty bad. Scottsville was a nice little town.  I had been here a few times in college to go tubing down the James.  We had some big old burgers at a shake and burger place.  The library was nice and cool, so we hung around for a while. Back at the campsite we met the wife of the proprieter.  She was friendly, and gave us some watermellon to enjoy.  The campsite was quiet and we had a good night of sleep. Quote of the day - "I didn't think six of you could ride on that bike." - owner of the campsite when she saw six people hanging around our tent.  Four of them were local kids that had snuck into the camping area to dip into the James. 
We headed out close to 8:30 for a short day just up the road to Charlottesville.  Route 20 wasn't great for riding, but it was okay.  We had been spoiled by the zero traffic roads we had ridden on for the past two days.  There was a nice shoulder, but the traffic was moving fast. We got off route 20 for the last 15 miles into town.  We ran into another guy who was out doing a quick ride.  He mentioned always wanting to go on a long tour but not finding the time.  He rode with us for about two miles and then we went our separate ways. In town, we were planning on staying at the Best Western Cavalier Inn.  We walked into the reception area and the guy behind the desk was just strange.  After looking us up and down, then checking his computer, he announced they were completely full for the night.  He said it in a way that we weren't sure if he was joking or what.  It was strange.  He stuck with his story and directed us to a Budget Inn just down the road. The more we thought about it the stranger is seemed.  We have a hard time believing the hotel was full on a Tuesday in the middle of the summer.  His loss.  Maybe we smelled worse than we knew. The Budget Inn receptionist was friendly.  She let us check in early and gave us an easy access room because of the bike.  It was a 180 from the guy at the Best Western. We ate at Littlejohn's.  Neither of us have ever eaten subs anywhere else that taste as good.  Now we're sitting in Stacks at Thornton Hall on the computer.  I'm hoping to convince Mary to pull an all-nighter just for the memories. Quote of the day - "Mary, look at that!" - Rob pointing out a guy mowing his lawn with nothing on but a hot pink banana hammock.  Too bad we didn't get a picture. 
We set the alarm for 5 am to get as many miles in as we could before it got hot.  We were off a little before 6 and the temperature was pleasant.     The riding was nice.  We stopped at a general store in Rockfish Gap.  The store wasn't open yet, but the woman inside gave us some orange and apple juice for free anyway. A couple of other riders came by, Anthony and Sean.  They had started somewhere in Pennsylvania and were going to San Francisco.  We talked for a bit, and said we would see them at the Cookie Lady's house. The first 30 miles took us to Afton, home of the Cookie Lady, June Curry.  She is famous for her hospitality to bike tourers.  We filled our bottles, each had a sandwich and listened to her stories for an hour.  She has met some amazing people, and has postcards from all over the world.  She took our picture and we got addded to the history.    After two long breaks in a short period of time we were ready to go.  We continued up and onto the Blue Ridge Parkway.  For some reason we thought the big climb was over - WRONG. The next 28 miles was a ton of elevation change.  Climb in the lowest gear for 2+ miles, then scream down for another mile.  There was a lot more up than down and it was tiring. We even had to add some miles after stopping to get water near Humpback Rock we started to climb.  After a mile of climbing I wanted to take a picture.  Opening our little front bag I noticed the guide book was missing.  Doh! We turned around and flew down the hill to claim our book.  It was sitting on a bench.  We grabbed it and were off for some more climbing. We got off the parkway and pulled into the Tye River Campground.  We haven't seen anyone else here including the owner.  We did some swimming and laundry. Clean clothes are nice! Quote of the day - "Oops.  We left the guidebook at the last stop " - Rob when he discovered the book was missing. 
Two miles down the road we stopped and ate breakfast at Gertie's.  It was a small general store in Vesuvius.  The owner, Gertie, made excellent eggs and homefries.  It hit the spot.    We moved along after breakfast and pulled into Lexington a little after noon.  A woman at the visitor center showed us some options for hotels. The Hampton Inn was closest to town so we decided to give that a shot.  The groundskeeper let us keep our bike in a storage area.  It was better option than trying to get it into our room. There was a pretty bug thunderstorm in the afternoon so we waited it out in our hotel room, and watched "Saving Silverman".  (Quality cinema Jim and Shanti!)  It was a better way to spend the storm than being on the road somewhere. After the storm we walked around Lexington.  We did a lap around the VMI parade grounds and walked around Washington & Lee. We ate dinner at Pizza Hut and bought some more food for the next couple of days.  Then we called it a night. Quote of the day - "You're 32?" - Pizza Hut manager as he checked out our ID's.  I guess he can't subtract too well, we're 31. 
We took advantage of the continental breakfast at the hotel and both agreed it was nice to eat some cereal.  The doughnuts (Rob) were excellent as well. We packed everything up and headed out in the rain. The hard rain lasted only about 10 minutes.  After that it just sprinkled off and on.    The riding was easy with some rolling hills.  The scenery was great.  We continue to see a ton of deer and today we saw about 10 turkeys hanging out in one field. We are making today another short day because we want to be in Blacksburg on Monday to pick up a car to get to Dan and Aynot's wedding.  With that in mid, we decided to visit Natural Bridge. The girl behind the ticket counter agreed to watch our stuff while we saw the bridge.  With the exception of the hotel in Charlottesville, everyone has been very helpful and friendly.   While waiting in line, we heard the following conversation by a local couple: Woman - "Did you find them?" Man - "No" Woman - "Did you look inside and outside?" Man - "Yep" Woman - "Well I can't believe we lost the kids" Note - all of this was said in very calm tones as if it happened regularly.  They decided to split up and look some more.  We were happy to see the family together later happily walking the trails with a dog and everything. After stashing our stuff, we saw the Natural Bridge.  It was more impressive than either of us expected.  After looking around for an hour or so, we collected our stuff (had a quick lunch of peanut butter and jelly sandwiches) and headed to the campground.    We camped at the KOA. Quote of the day - "How do your ride with this bag on your bike?" - girl at the ticket counter as we brought our huge red bag in for her to watch.  She didn't know we had a trailer.   Mary's favorite quote (little girl at the campground) - "Do you know you (Rob) look just like Tony Hawk.  My mommy said I shouldn't come over and bother you but I just had to tell you." 
We took our time breaking down camp and headed out close to 8.  After a super-nutritious breakfast of Krispy Kreme's we were tanked up and ready to go. The ride to Buchanan was easy, and we pulled in a little after nine.  We found the library and checked email and updated the journal for an hour or so. Back on the road we ticked off another 10 miles.  We were passed by a group of four cyclists who were out for a little ride.  They chatted with us for a little while, but they were moving too fast for us to ride with them.  The riding continued to be great: no traffic, rolling hills, plenty of shade. For lunch we stopped at a little mini-mart and got some snack food.  We both had peanut butter sandwiches for a main course. The last five miles of the day seemed hot.  It was mostly uphill and the trees providing shade seemed to of disappeared.  We set up camp at the Troutville Park.  Amazingly, they let you camp there for free. We were set up for the night a little after noon, so we got to watch the people at the park all day.  It was kind of interesting.  After a while we both felt strange about hanging out in this little town's park for the entire day. I (Rob) once read a weblog where a guy spent an entire day in a Home Depot on a bet.  I felt kind of like that after hanging around in the park waiting for it to get dark for nine hours.  (Read the Home Depot weblog).    We did have a nice dinner of eggs and potatoes.  There was a little market right next to the park that had everything we could need. Quote of the day - "You two at the park?" - woman at the cash register in the market.  Mary and I were baffled that she could tell we were camping in the park. 
We headed out of Troutville a little before 6:30.  It was sad leaving the park after spending so much time there.  The air was cool, and the riding continued to be great. At about 10 miles we stopped at a gas station and had breakfast, then continued on our way.      15 miles into the ride we crossed a bridge that had about 10 huge vultures hanging out on one of the railings.  They flew off when we came along.  They are very big birds.  We were both glad they had flown away. At about 20 miles we had our first bear sighting.  We were just starting to crank up a pretty steep hill when we saw this thing come out on the road about 200 yards in front of us.  At first I (Rob) thought it was a cow or a really big dog, but quickly realized it was a black bear.  It seemed more scared of us than we were of it and it quickly hi-tailed it back into the woods next to the road. We moved fast through that section (even going uphill), and made lots of noise so it didn't come back out. We saw a lot more people out on bicycles today.  The first two guys we ran into were doing a long ride from Roanoke.  We stopped and talked to them for a little bit.  The one guy had ridden his bike across the country three times.  He said he had averaged about 150 miles a day.  I guess when you're doing that kind of mileage doing this trip multiple times might be an option.    We then saw a lot of just recreational bikers out.  They were all going the other way. The last part of the ride was up over a ridge into Blacksburg.  It was  a pretty steep climb for about 2 1/2 miles and then a nice screaming downhill for a mile. We toured around Blacksburg looking for a hotel, and ended up staying in the Alumni Hall hotel.  Now were cruising around the Virginia Tech campus and found the library. This will probably be the last update until after the fourth.  We're off to Lynchburg and then Washington D.C (by car) for my brother's wedding.  We'll be back July 5th or so. 
After saying goodbyes to everyone we headed to Blacksburg close to 10:30.  Driving down 81 it was interesting to go flying past the roads we were riding last week. We picked the bike up from East Coasters at 3 and dropped the car off a short time later.  The people at East Coasters were very generous, and we were very thankful they watched the bike for us while we were gone. The ten minutes we spent getting all of our gear on the bike was crazy hot, but once we were on our way it didn't seem so bad. The ride out of Blacksburg was great.  A short climb followed by 2 1/2 miles of screaming descent.  At the bottom of the hill there was a guy sitting on his porch smoking.  He had been in the exact same spot five days earlier.  He must do nothing but smoke and hang out on his porch all day. We had our first dog incident at about 15 miles.  This vicious killer chihuahua came at us out of nowhere.  Mary impressed the hell out of me with her amazing pepper spray reaction time.  Before I even knew what was going on she was spraying like crazy.  Now she needs to work on her aim. The rest of the ride was uneventful.  We camped at Interstate Park which was surprisingly right next to interstate 81. There was a group of 12 & 13 year old girls in the campground who are riding the state of Virginia. Its going to take them 12 days and then they are rafting for two days.  We'll probably run into them again. The only bad thing is the mosquitoes found our campsite for the first time on the trip. Quote of the day - "Work schmerk.  Do you realize you're living the dream of every bike shop employee in the world." - woman (Amy) at East Coasters when we told her we had to be back in Seattle by mid-September to go to work. 
We were on the road a little after 6 and say an outdoor thermometer that said 63.  Very nice.  Christiansburg was still asleep as we left town and traffic was almost non-existant. At 20 miles we stopped in at a mini-mart for a quick snack.  I (Rob) even had an apple.  It was very dull yellow, almost beige, so I didn't venture too far from my all-beige diet. The owner and his wife were super-friendly.  We sat on a little bench in front of the store talking to them for a while.  The owner gave Dan his condolences on getting married.  His wife responded saying they had been married 45 years so it couldn't be too bad. From the market we went through the town of Draper, where there was supposed to be a must stop market.  Somehow we missed it.  Too bad, it was rumored to have excellent food and be inexpensive. We pulled into the Wytheville KOA at noon and grabbed one of the last spots.  The campground was insane.  It cost $32 for a tent site.  It also had a pool with a huge slide, a large screen TV room showing "Air Bud" continuously, miniature golf, karaoke, horseback riding, batting cages, a basketball tournement, video game room, and we were treated to fireworks.  All we really wanted was a shower. The karaoke was outside, at outdoor concert volume levels.  Literally everyone in the campground was subjected to really bad singing for three hours.  In addition to the poor singing quality, being in southwest Virginia made most of the selections country music.  The best selection of the night was Peter Gunn. Why a karaoke setup would even have that song is a mystery. The jury is still out on whether the shower offset the karaoke. Quote of the day - "Y'all ain't movin' too fast" - man on the side of the road setting up a huge circus like tent.  We were crawling up a fairly steep hill as we passed.  We have no idea why he was setting up the tent in his yard.    
We also had our first equipment breakage.  I (Rob) accidentally rolled up the tent with Mary's sunglasses inside.  Crunch!  The bridge was snapped in half.  Somehow Mary rigged them so they worked for the ride today. We rode close to six miles and decided to stop at a mini-mart for a quick breakfast.  It took close to 20 minutes to get through the line.  One woman wrote a bad check and they let her pay with it anyway.  The next woman wanted some marlboro lights.  It took 10 minutes to figure out they didn't have any.  We finally paid and got out of there. The next few miles was strip mall hell.  Kind of like riding on Aurora in Seattle.  We were both glad it was early and the traffic was light. The rest of the ride was awesome.  We entered the Mount Rogers recreation area and it was beautiful.  We had two long climbs but the grades were so easy we just cruised along.    At one point we stopped to take off our long sleeve shirts and a whole herd of cattle came running to the fence beside us.  They must of thought we were delivering food.  It was funny to see them running. The ride ended with 10 of the last 12 miles being downhill.  We ended the day with an average speed of 13.2 mph.  Almost one mph faster than any other day. We ended the day in Damascus.  The Appalachian trail goes right throught town so there are a lot of services geared towards hikers.  We stopped at a bike shop to see if they had any sunglasses, but they didn't have any Mary liked.    Next stop was a cyber cafe. We checked email and updated the journal. We spent the night at "The Place", a hostel for AT hikers and bike tourers.  There were about 10 other people there.  We spent a lot of time talking to a guy named Jake.  He was spending six weeks trying to hike through Virginia.  He was nice and gave us some duct tape to fix Mary's sunglasses. We ended up going out to eat pizza with Jake.  The pizza was good and Jake had some funny stories. The best was about a guy that hiked the trail with a five gallon paint bucket to hold all of his stuff.  It turns out he was a vagrant from somewhere in Georgia.  The sheriff had driven him to the trailhead and told him not to come back.  Probably an urban legend, but still pretty funny. Quote of the day - "That's a bicycle built for two!" - everyone in Virginia.  It seems like the word "tandem" doesn't exist here. 
It was pretty cool although not as cool as the past couple of mornings.  The first 20 miles past quickly. We hit the first of four big climbs today at about 25 miles.  It was four miles long, and we gained about 1500 ft.  It was still cool so it didn't seem too bad. We passed our first option for spending the night a little after 10 am and neither of us was tired so we moved on. In Rosedale we stopped at a little gas station (okay, a mini-mart) that also served breakfast.  We ate some egg biscuts and talked to another patron for a while. He was a little hard to understand but was nice enough.  He was into ham radio and was talking about how he had recently participated in a ham radio-a-thon to raise money for something.  He had talked to someone from Seattle during this thing and was excited about that.  He was so hard to understand in person we couldn't imagine talking to him on the radio. After Rosedale it was a pretty miserable four miles to Honaker (pronounced HO-nake-er).  Traffic was heavy and there wasn't much of a shoulder. After that things got better and before we knew it we were on our second climb.  It was a little over two miles and again it wasn't too bad. From the climb we moved on to Council, our second option for spending the night.  We still were feeling pretty good so we decided to keep moving. About ten miles down the road we stopped at a little diner for lunch in Birchleaf.  There were four other people in the diner and they were all curious about our trip.  It was fun to sit and talk for about an hour. The last 15 miles were hard.  We passed one thermometer and it said 90.  The second to last hill was only a mile, but it seemed a lot longer.  The heat and the traffic made it less than fun.  We made it over the top and pushed on. The last hill was coming into the park.  It was a killer.  We finally limped into the park at 3:30.    The campsite was nice but frankly we were too tired to enjoy it.  We got the tent setup, crawled inside just in time to miss a quick rain shower and fell asleep.  We woke up about an hour later, ate dinner, then went back to bed. As a side note Rob's diet for the day:  Note - Mary's diet wasn't much better.  Substitute two bananas, a peach, a plum, cheese and crackers, and chocolate grahams for the burger and onion rings. Quote of the day - "See that one of the frogs sitting under the umbrella, everyone has that one." - Mary commenting on all the lawn ornaments people have in their yards.  Our current favorite is the one where there is a little boy with his pants around his ankles with his back turned towards you like he is peeing.  Next to him is a little girl looking shocked.  Tasteful.    
   We passed through Elkhorn City and at Ashcamp started riding on a road that was more like an extended driveway.  It was maybe 15 ft. wide and curved all over the place.  It was amazing to see a road even built like that. We did a mini-climb which produced the first full-body-sweat of the day.  Of course the downhill completely dried us off.  We then immediately went into the second full-body-sweat hill.  This one was the longest we have done yet.  Close to five miles of hard climbing.  It took a full hour to get over the hill. At the bottom of the hill we say and ate a pound of cheese and a rack of salteens.  Yummy. About ten miles down the road we hit another big hill.  The most disappointing thing about these hills is they don't have any kind of name.  You can't brag about riding over something like "Big Ass Hill".  Then all the locals would bow at your feet. At the top of the hill we passed into a new county.  The county we came from must of been dry because there were Bud Light signs all over everything for the next 15 miles.  Then we crossed into another county which must of been dry because the beer sign stopped again. We saw a lot of coal trucks today.  All of them were going the other way.  Hopefully that will continue. We ended the day at a hostel in Pippa Passes.  It's a small town that is home to Alice Loyd College.  The hostel owner showed us where we could do laundry for F-R-E-E.  Such a bonus.  We were also able to get online but the computers were glacial speed so all we could do is check a little email before the library closed. The accomodations are okay. For those reading that went to the Mt. St. Helens cabin with us a few years ago you'll appreciate how musty this place was.  On a scale of 1-10 for musty, with 10 being very musty, this place is a 9 with Mt. St. Helens now placing a distant 3. There are three cats here that we had fun playing with.  One even brought Mary a dead mouse as a gift.  She wasn't very grateful.    Quote of the day - "There's a free washer and drying just down the hill." - Charlotte (owner of the hostel).  After three days of full-body sweat hills and humid sleeping this was music to our ears. 
There was a good sized hill coming out of Pippa Passes but after that the next 20 miles were great.  We were cruised along at 18-20 mph the whole way.    We stopped at a gas station outside of Hazzard to refill our water bottles.  We must of had ten people stop to ask about the trip.  The bike seems to attract people.  All of them were nice, and all of them thought we were crazy. The last 35 miles was more hilly terrain.  There were three big climbs and one decent that made my hands hurt from grabbing the brakes so much.  On the last of the climbs I made the comment to Mary that Jim and Shanti would probably think we looked pathetic on this hill.  They had commented about a group of riders they had seen somewhere in Washington going up a hill about a month before we started the trip.  I'm sure we looked just as bad as anything they saw that day. We saw more coal trucks today.  They've been courteous drivers so it hasn't been too bad.  In some of the road cuts you can see the layer of coal between layers of slate.  It is one to two feet thick in most places.  The mountains around here are full of it. We ended the day at Buckhorn Lake Park.  The campsite was nice and the showers were great, although they were set a hot temperature and you couldn't change it. We walked about a mile to get some milkshakes, then stopped in a general store that had everything from tombstones to canned salmon.  The slogan out front was "We have it if Frank can find it".    Quote of the day - "I'm heading up highway 15 if you want to grab on for a while." - Bud delivery man as we were filling out water bottles.  Unfortunately we weren't going that way.    
Again there was a pretty big hill coming out of Buckhorn, but then things leveled out for a while and we had some nice riding for about 30 miles. We had a pack of three dogs chase us at about the 15 mile mark today.  It was actually funny.  We were moving along at a good clip so we didn't think they could catch us.  They were amazing, and followed us for a 1/2 mile at close to 20 mph before finally giving up.  It was impressive.  I guess they've been in training all summer with the other bikers.  I could envision them getting a little further each time they chased someone on a bike.  By the time the bikes going East hit here, they might be able to follow for a mile. Then the hills started.  Today's were the steepest yet.  Mary has been saying for two days now that Kentucky's hills have been worse than Virginia's and I finally have to agree.  They were steep enough that even in the lowest gear we had we were just grinding away, barely able to get the next pedal stroke around.  This lasted for about 10 miles.  By the end of it both of us were sick of hills. At the end of the hills we stopped the bike next to some abandoned building and proceeded to eat most of the rest of the food we had with us.  We had some old guy stop his truck in the middle of the intersection to talk to us.  We couldn't really understand what he was saying but it seemed funny to him.  He was laughing quite a bit. The last 20 miles of the day was a lot more reasonable.  Still some steep hills but nothing like earlier. We pulled into Irvine a little before 1 and checked in at the hotel.  The guy behind the desk was nice enough to offer to do laundry for us in the hotel machine.  We took him up on it.  He also had some funny comments about the meat selection you can get in rural Kentucky.  We had tried to get some canned chicken to go with our noodles the night before and it seems like all they have here is ham, liver and bologna.  He said bologna is actually Kentucky's finest roundsteak.  He also said he liked to drive out into the country to buy some by the foot. I hiked about a mile to the library to get the journals up to date.  Now I'm heading back to the hotel to take a nap. Sure is a tough life. Quote of the day - "B'careful msdpsd asdfq aoujf pmsdf sdfhlke runover!" - man who turned his car off in the middle of an intersection to ask us where we were going and what we were doing.  We were just checking the guidebook description.  Neither of us have any idea what he said but he seemed friendly. 
It was nice to take advantage of having a hotel room so we pulled the shades and didn't get moving until close to 10.  After the last few days we both needed a good nights sleep. We got lucky with the weather again today.  It was overcast and probably in the low 70's even at 11 when we rolled out of Irvine.  The humidity was pretty high, but with the low temperatures, it wasn't too bad. The first 20 miles of the ride was heaven.  Almost no traffic, and nice rolling hills.  There were a few steep ones, but nothing like what we'd been going over for the past few days.    We did have a couple of dogs chase us today, but overall the number of dogs in Kentucky has not lived up to expecations.  Mary still hasn't actually hit any of them with the pepper spray.  Maybe tomorrow. We stopped at a mini-mart (what else?) for lunch.  We had some pizza left over from the day before so we just got some drinks and chips to accompany the pizza.  The people in the market had a log book for bikers.  They saw a lot of them there.  The two guys we had met near Afton had been through here July 3rd, so they had made up 9 days on us.  We missed five due to Dan's wedding, but still those two are hauling.  They must be doing close to 100 miles a day. There were tables out front and two men and a boy were out there eating huge bologna sandwiches (Kentucky roundsteak).  They were really friendly and wanted to know all about our trip.  They were tobacco farmers and had been working the fields that morning and had collected about 15 arrowheads just this morning.  I guess they are common in the fields, and one guy was talking about how he had uncovered about 20 of them a few years back that were in perfect shape.  The little boy was funny and wanted to know how often we ate there.  We all got a laugh out of that. The rest of the ride wasn't nearly as nice.  In fact it was not good at all.  A narrow two lane road leading into Berea for about 10 miles.  Berea is a town of 9,000, the largest we've hit in a while, and the traffic was heavy.  Then when we got here we had to go through some pretty major construction which is always fun on a bike. We're camping at an RV park next to Interstate 75.  The tent area is near the woods at the back of the facility, and the mosquitoes are awful.  We'll probably eat out tonight to avoid having to cook outside.  It was all we could do to get the tent setup before they ate us alive. There is a craft festival going on in town, so being the craft connoisseurs that we are, we'll have to check it out.  We'll probably pick up a good 10-15 pounds of lawn ornaments to bring home with us. There is also Berea College here.  It's an interesting school.  Students don't pay tuition.  Instead they work 10-15 hours a week doing maintenance on the school to pay for their education.  Not a bad way to get a college education.    Quote of the day - "He was going to trade his arrowheads for a bologna sandwich" - Man at the mini-mart talking about how his son wanted to trade the arrowheads he had found that morning for lunch. 
We started walking back to where we were camped and noticed the sky was kind of dark.  It looked like it might shower so we stopped into an all-you-can-eat pizza and pasta place.  Just then the sky opened up.  It rained more than either of us thought was possible. For close to an hour it rained hard enough you could of taken a shower in the downpour.  We were then lulled into a false sense of security by a break in the rain and decided to walk back to the tent.  About half-way back to the tent the sky opened up again.  We got soaked completely. Luckily the campground had some dryers so we were able to get the stuff we were wearing dry.  We crawled into the tent for the night thinking the rain would probably stop sometime during the night. Instead it poured all night.  I honestly didn't know it was possible to rain this much.  The first real rain of the trip, and it was a doosy. 
We decided to wait out the rain in the dry tent.  Two hours later the rain started to taper off so we ventured out and ate breakfast at a local diner.  We were trying to decide what to do for the rest of the day.  It looked like things were going to clear up so we went back to camp to pack up. In the ten minutes it took to pack up the mosquitoes made a feast out of us.  I counted close to 20 bites on Mary.  It also started raining as we were packing up, but not too hard. We stopped at Wal-Mart to get some supplies (side note: travel wipes are the best thing I've ever used on bike grease).  Then we started riding close to 10. Within two miles of riding the sky opened up again and didn't let up for the next 30 miles.  Between the downpour all night and the all day deluge almost three inches of rain fell. At 30 miles the rain did slow down and we had a pleasant last 20 miles of riding.  We pulled into Harrodsburg with all of our camping stuff completely soaked so we got a hotel room to dry things out. The rain finally petered out close to 4 and the sun even peeked out. Harrodsburg is the oldest city West of the Allegheny Mountains.  They have a replica of the original 1774 fort so we took a tour of that.    At night they have a play, "Daniel Boone, The Man & The Legend".  We figured we would probably never be here again and we didn't know much about Daniel Boone so we would check it out. Wow!  It's hard to describe how bad this play was.  It was outdoors on a dirt stage.  There weren't any microphones so the actors were all literally yelling their lines.  The play was also way into fighting.  Over half the play was people rolling around in the dirt.  Actually not just rolling around, more like WWF without a ring.  The best was when Danile Boone ran towards one of the Indians, jumped up so his legs were around the guy's neck, and then flipped him over (I am not exaggerating!) The play also used extensive use of explosions.  One went off in this moat in front of the audience and it must of been a mistake.  It completely covered four people in the front row with mud.  They were not happy.  It threw mud about ten rows up.  Luckily we were on the other side of we would of had to go and do laundry.  They also had indians running around in loinclothes and a graphic scalping on Daniel's son, complete with fake blood. The first act was over and hour so we didn't stick around for act two.  We came back to the hotel and called it a night.  We still don't know anything about Daniel Boone. Quote of the day - "If I hear one more person talk about how they need rain I'm going to scream!" - Rob complaining about the downpour that had been going on for over 18 hours. 
After breakfast we packed up and were on our way by 8.  Amazingly everything we had dried out overnight.  It was cool and overcast and it seemed like the humidity was close to 100%. The riding today was nice.  We were finally out of the big hills but it was still rolling.  We were also into the larger cattle ranch type farms which was a big change from the coal mining areas.    At about halfway we stopped in Springfield for an early lunch.l  We ate outside the courthours where Tom Lincoln (Abraham Lincoln's father) applied for his marriage certificate.    After lunch we continued on and rode through the Lincoln homestead.  It's where Abraham Lincoln's father lived until he was 25 and got married. From there it was an easy last 20 miles to Bardstown.  We tried to go to the bike shop in town to get some break pads but it was closed on Sundays. We camped the night at My Old Kentucky Home park.  There was a musical about Steven Foster (composer of "My Old Kentucky Home" who lived in Bardstown), but after the debacle of a play the night before we decided against it. We're finally spending the night in a county where you can buy beer.  We were looking forward to having a drink with dinner but of course it's Sunday and they have blue laws.  Oh well.  Instead we walked to McDonalds after dinner and each had a sundae. Bardstown seemed more affluent than the other towns we've been staying in.  More luxury cars and fewer pick-ups.  The few pick-ups we did see were fancy compared to the standard farm trucks we'd seen the past few days. Quote of the day - "Of course not!" - woman at mini-mart when I asked if I could buy beer on Sudays.  It wasn't so obvious to me.    
We broke camp disappointed in breakfast but we figured we would hit a mini-mark a few miles down the road.  After a mile or so of riding it became obvious the fog was still too heavy to be riding on the road.  We turned around and headed to McDonalds for breakfast and to wait out the fog. It was good to sit and read the paper and after an hour or so the fog had lifted. We headed out and at about 25 miles we took a break in Howardstown to eat a little and finish reading the paper.  They sold beer there and in hindsight we should of bought some, but we didn't. From there it was off to Abraham Lincoln's Birthplace National Monument.  We stopped in and watched the movie.  It was slim on facts and big on braging about Kentucky even thought Lincoln moved to Illinois when he was 8.      We talked to family outside the monument who were funny.  They gave us a root beer and were trying to give us all kinds of chocolate but it would of melted all over our food bag so we didn't take it. From there we pulled into LaRue County Park for some free camping.  Once again we found ourselves hanging around in a park waiting for dark.  It seemed strange to be setting up camp less than 100 yards away from someone's yard.  The park had a pool but the pump was broken so we couldn't swim.  At least they had showers in the park.    Quote of the day - "Just remember when you're struggling up some huge hill in 100 degree weather, it's still better than 1000 miles in an air conditioned car with a nine year old girl" - man at Lincoln Birthplace Monument about his daughter.  I guess she was driving the rest of the family crazy. 
The riding was excellent.  The past few days have been step rolling hills so it was difficult to carry any momentum.  Tody was almost flat in comparison.  The miles just rolled by. At 40 miles we crossed into the Central Time Zone.  It was cool to think we had pedaled far enough to need to set our watches back. We stopped at a gas station/diner for lunch and each had a hamburger and onion rings. From there we went to Rough River Dam Campground and set up camp.  We walked over to the pool and had a nice swim.    After dinner we learned that the national fiddle and bluegrass contest was going to be held at the at the dam's conference center the next weekend. As a result most of the campers around us were musicians and they were all sitting around their campsites jamming. I (Rob) wandered over to one group and they invited me to sit down and enjoy.  I know nothing about bluegrass but these guys seemed great.  It was fun to sit and watch them improvise.    After about an hour the session was cut short when a huge storm blew in.  It ended up raining for over 3 hours.  We were beginning to worry we  might have a repeat of Berea but it stopped a little after 10. Quote of the day - "You ain't had much exposure to bluegrass music." - response from the bass player when I said my only exposure to bluegrass was the 'Oh Brother Where Art Thou' sound track. 
The riding continued to be easy with some nice rolling hills.  We rode through farmland most of the day.    We snacked a little but decided to push to Utica at 45 miles before really stopping to eat.  By the time we pulled into the market I (Rob) was starting to bonk.  No problem.  Nothing a coke, a bag of fritos, and half a large pizza wouldn't fix.  Mary skipped the fritos and coke (Side note - Rob's stomach didn't feel too well for the next few miles). We set off with 30 miles to go.  We hit our first headwinds of the trip.  Nothing too bad but we started having to pedal to get downhill. It also threatened to rain the second part of the ride but nothing ever came of it.    We pulled into Sebree a little after two and headed to the city park where we would be spending the night.  (That's right another city park where we hang around waiting for dark).  They had a nice outdoor pool with a diving board.  I (Rob) played around on the diving board long enough to hit the water once and have my running shorts around my ankles and figured that was probably enough of that (after some quick underwater action to get them up).  Mary was sitting outside under the pavillion and couldn't figure out why I had stopped diving. After swimming we set the tent out in the sun to dry it all out.  It didn't take long.  We also had an extremely annoying nine year old kid pester us for a good hour.  He must have been tired of swimming.  He told us lots of useless information like - "No, there aren't any trains during the night" (raiload directly adjacent to camp area) and that we should definitely visit "Quigley's Restaraunt" if we were ever in Alabama. The pool closed at 5 and just as everyone was leaving another bike tourer came up.  His name was Billy and he was also going West on the same route we were. The first story out of his mouth was a story about trying to get a beer in Kentucky.  We have yet to spend the night in a county where beer is available.  He had spent the previous night in Utica and had run into a guy who drove to the next county to get him some beer.  We haven't been so lucky.  Not that we can't live without it, but when it's not an option, you start to notice. We talked for a while.  Another local cyclist showed up and talked to us for an hour or so.  He was all over the place with his conversation.  He raced mountain bikes, built frames, hiked the appahlachin trail, did mountain bike clinics and wanted to buy our tandem.  He was a talker. Finally we set up the tent in a picnic shelter because the forecast was calling for rain.  At least we'll be dry for sure tonight. Quote of the day - " Leave the man alone."  Dad reprimanding annoying kid as he tried to talk to Rob while he was taking a shower.  Needless to say it didn't deter him in the least. 
   We packed up quickly, said goodbye to Billy, and headed down the road.  At ten miles we stopped in a small town to pick up some drinks. At 20 miles we sat down in the town of Clay and had a quick snack of Ritz and cheese.  We looked for the market that was supposed to be in town but couldn't find it.  After a few minutes of searching we gave up and headed onward to Marion the next town on the route. Marion turned into a very productive stop for us.  We ran into Rose, sort of a town greeter who showed us where the library, a barber shop, the farm market, and the supermarket all were.  She also had big plans to turn a vacant lot in town into a bicyclists stopover type place with showers and water.  It will be nice if she gets it done.  She also offered us some water from her house. There were a ton of motorcycles driving around town and it turned out this weekend was the Little Sturgis rally in Sturgis, KY.  They were expecting between 24,000 and 26,000 people for this thing. We hit the library and read email and updated the web site.  It was the nicest public library internet access we've had yet. Next we both got our hair cut.  Mary got a nice stylish doo, and I had my head shaved (not quite bald).  It feels good in the heat. Finally we grabbed some lunch at the Subway and hit the farmers market for some corn and potatos. After our three hour layover we headed out for the last 12 miles of Kentucky, and onward to Illinois.  We rode down to the Ohio river and right onto the ferry that took us across to Illinois.  The ferry was quite a bit smaller than what we were used to from Seattle.  It was really a barge that held about 15-20 cars at the most, with a tug pushing it across the water.    After getting off the ferry it was a quick but hilly mile to the Cave In Rock Campground.  We set up camp and about an hour later Billy pulled in.  As he was setting up a quick but hard rain shower blew in.  Of course this came just after the ranger had said they hadn't had any rain for three weeks.  We seem to be a rain magnet. It cleared about an hour later and we had a cool night for sleeping. Quote of the day - "I wouldn't dip my foot in that river" - park ranger explaining why we shouldn't go for a swim in the Ohio River.    
The cave was surprisingly large.  Probably about 100 ft. deep and at least 50 ft at its highest point.  The cave has an interesting past.  At one point it was used as a home base for pirates who would attack people traveling on the river.    After checking out the cave we went back to the campsite and packed up for the short ride to Elizabethtown to meet Mary's sister, Laura, her husband Steve, and their seven month old, Sam.  The ride was along the Ohio River and was very hilly.  A lot of super steep short type hills.  On top of the hills the road was the roughest we've encountered.    We got to town and saw a laundry so we decided it might be nice to have some clean clothes to meet Laura, Steve and Sam.  We had an interesting conversation with a woman who tied the rebar in concrete bridge decks.  It sounded like a tough hot job. After getting some clean clothes we rode to the River Rose Inn, the bed & breakfast we were staying in.  Just as we pulled up Laura, Steve and Sam pulled in.  Sam has grown a ton since we saw him in February.  His nickname at daycare is "Smiley Baby" and it was easy to see why.  He doesn't seem to ever stop smiling.    We checked into the Inn which was a huge house built in 1914.  The owners had re-done the entire inside of the house themselves and it was beautiful. After a great lunch of fried catfish we got in the car and drove back to Cave In Rock so Laura, Steve and Sam could see the cave.  Of course in the car it only took 15 minutes to get there. We finally spent the night in a place where we could buy beer so we had pizza and beer for dinner.  It was the best a Miller has ever tasted. Quote of the day - "That one looks like the Super Bowl Trophy!" - Steve commenting on one of the lawn ornaments we saw. 
The owner of the Inn (Elizabeth) put some fruit and muffins out so we would have some breakfast before we started out.  Laura had never ridden the tandem before so we did a quick practice run in front of the Inn before we left.  While practicing this woman came over smoking a huge cigar (at 6:30 in the morning!) and started talking to us about riding a tandem.  She didn't make much sense so we just sort of nodded our heads, smiled and tried to get away.  I guess she owned the hotel across from the Inn and was known to be a little crazy. We got moving before 7 and made really good time going down the road.  With nothing on the bike we averaged close to 16 mph the whole way.  Steve and Mary stuck around at the Inn until 8 and had some breakfast with the rest of the guests.  Then they loaded up the car close to 9 to catch up with Laura and me. Laura and I stopped at 20 miles at a mini-mart for a small package of donuts.  I had to give her the full experience and it just wouldn't be the real thing without eating some crap from a mini-mart.  She said she felt good so on we went. At about 35 miles we ran into our first Eastbound bikers.  They had started in San Francisco at the end of May.  They had some good advice about Missouri (watch out for the logging trucks), and were frightened about the dogs in Kentucky.  I guess they had met some other Westbound riders that had been bitten.  It seems like Mary and I got through Kentucky easier than others on the dog front. After about 15 minutes of talking we moved on.  At about 40 miles Mary, Steve and Sam caught us.  We pulled over to refill our water bottles and then agreed to meet them about 10 miles up the road.  Laura was still feeling good.  We rode the 10 miles and met them in a small town.  We ate lunch at a sub shop and then I decided to ride the last 30 miles by myself on the tandem.  Mary was enjoying her day off and it didn't seem like she needed to get on the bike. So off I went on the tandem by myself.  The miles flew by, it wasn't very hilly and the bike seemed so light it was comical.  I got a few strange looks from people passing by in cars, but no one said anything.  It was a little hot though.  Later we heard it was 95 with a heat index of 106.  No wonder I had the full body sweat going. A little less than an hour and a half later I pulled into Carbondale.  It took about a half hour to find the hotel where Mary was staying.  No one I talked to even knew that Main Street existed in Carbondale.  The fact that I asked one person where Main Street was while actually STANDING ON MAIN STREET makes me think they should invest in a few more street signs in Carbondale.  Of course that person didn't know where Main Street was either.  They also looked at me kind of funny because I was in full body sweat mode riding a tandem bike by myself.  Not really the picture of sanity. I finally found the hotel and we had a nice afternoon spending time with Sam, Laura and Steve.  We went to the bike shop in town to get some brake pads and they guy knew immediately we were riding across the country.  We couldn't figure out how but he said he noticed the tan lines on our hands.  We have very dark circles in the middle of the back of our hands from the cycling gloves. Quote of the day - "There's no Main Street in Carbondale" - answer from one of the people I got trying to find the hotel we were staying in which was on Main Street. 
Laura, Steve & Sam hung around until close to 9 and then packed up to head home.  Sam continued to be well behaved. It also turned out to be the hottest day yet.  96 real temperature and a heat index of 106.  It was nice to be in the cool hotel room. I walked to SIU (Southern Illinois University) and got online for a little while.  The 20 minute walk had me completely soaked with sweat.  It was hot. Later we ventured out to see the movie Men in Black II.  It was entertaining.  We also spent a coupole of hours at a Barnes & Noble.  They had a Starbucks and it was nice to get a little Seattle. Tomorrow we're off to Missouri.  Our fourth state.  It's flying by. 
The first 40 miles today were very nice.  They first 10 or so took us through Murphysboro and then down to the Mississippi flats.  The fields along the river looked the most healthy of any we had seen and it was nice to just cruise along at close to 20 mph.  It was hot though.  We weren't working very hard but were both sweating quite a bit. We hit the town of Chester before 9 and stopped at a Hardee's for breakfast.  It was full of a bunch of men having their morning coffee.  We're not sure if they even saw us even thought the only empty seat in the place was in the middle of them.  We got to hear all about who was sick, who had died recently and who had diarreah.  Nice things to hear about while eating breakfast. Chester is the home town to the guy that created Popeye.  There was a Popeye themed everything in Chester: pizza, burgers, laundry, car dealerships.    It was too early to call it a day but it was feeling very hot.  We tanked up on water and Gatorade and headed to Missouri. On the way out of town we stopped at a statue of Popeye to take a picture.  There were four people there from Oklahoma who couldn't really believe we were riding a bike across the country. After the photo-op we crossed the Mississippi on the worse bridge we've had to cross yet.  It was a two lane highway with heavy truck traffic and no shoulder.  We waited until there wasn't any traffic and sprinted across as fast as we could go.  You couldn't even enjoy the view of the river.    Once in Missouri we had about 10 miles of totally flat riding before heading into some hills.  We experienced our first headwind leaving the river flats.  It wasn't terrible but enough to slow us down a little. The last 10 miles was through some hillier terrain.  Not too bad but a good warmup for the Ozarks.  We ended the day in a nice hotel on Interstate 55.  We wanted to camp but the next campground was 30 miles away and the heat index was 103.  We wanted to get out of the heat. We did some laundry and watched bad daytime TV in the AC.  Tomorrow is supposed to be cooler so we'll see how that goes. Quote of the day - "Let's begin Operation Refreshment" - Mary sitting in the parking lot of a mini-mart about to fill our eight water bottles in Chester.    
Turns out the rest of the ride was pretty quick.  We hit the town of Farmington and refilled our bottles.  Then we moved along leaving on HWY W.  This was not a fun road.  No shoulder and pretty heavy truck traffic. After 8 miles of that we turned off and had almost traffic free riding for the rest of the day.  We stopped and ate a non mini-mart lunch at the park in Pine Knob. Next we visited Elephant Rocks State Park.  It is a series of huge granite boulders that have eroded away to look like large elephants.  We spend about an hour there and then headed out to Johnston's Shut-Ins.      The 13 miles to the park were phenomenal.  It seemed like a gradual downhill the whole way. We ran into an Eastbound biker, Art, just before the park.  He said the park was great and he had loved the Ozarks.  We talked for a little while and said goodbye. The park itself was great.  A shut-in is a steep V-shaped gorge carved in volcanic rock by flowing water.  We played in the water with about 100 other people for a while.  The water was at least 70 and crystal clear.  It was like a natural made waterslide park.    Then we ate dinner and called it a night. Quote of the day - "We never turn away bikers!" - woman at camp check in explaining that they were full but would let us use the Scout area.  Thank goodness because it would of been a very long day if we had had to go to the next campground area. 
We packed up and moved along into the Ozarks.  We had to sneak around the gate to get out of the park.  It seemed strange they locked you into the park. In Centerville we re-supplied and kept moving.  The hills were actually a lot of fun today.  Some of the climbs were steep but none too long, and the downhills were awesome.  We had heard the Ozarks described as a human powered roller coaster and that is a great description.  We even lost our stomachs on a couple of the downhills.  At least Mary didn't get motion sick on me. We entered the Ozark National Scenic Riverways and crossed the Current River.  The climb out of the river valley was the one long climb of the day.  After that we did a lot more up and down into Eminence.  The town is on the Jacks Fork River and bills itself as the canoe capitol of the world. We found a laundromat and watched some TV in the Air Conditioning while cleaning our clothes.  We had a discussion about our trailer with a guy who wanted to hook it up to his dog.  Personally I have a hard time figuring out how you would attach the thing to a dog, but this guy seemed crazy enough to figure it out.  His was had a huge tatoo that wrapped her entire body at chest level.  It was hard to tell what it was because her bikini top covered the front half of it. Next we headed to a campground on the river for the night.  We took a quick dip in the river which was very refreshing.  The were a ton of people canoeing down the river.  The outfitters in town do a shuttle service so you don't have to go up river. Its amazing how full the campgrounds are here.  In Virginia we almost always had the places to ourselves.  In Kentucky they were more full, but not totally full.  Both places we've camped in Missouri have been totally full.  Luckily they make room for cyclists. We walked back into town after dinner to get some ice cream.  The local kids were crusing up and down the main street.  It was kind of amusing to watch. Quote of the day - "It's city water!" - answer to Mary asking where we could get water at the campground.  We guessed that meant the water in the bathrooms was okay to drink. 
We were moving just before 8 and the going was kind of slow.  The steepest longest hills we had experienced yet in the Ozarks. At Alley Springs we stopped for a few minutes to see the spring and an old mill built next to it.  It pumps out 81 million gallons of water per day and feeds into the Jack Forks River.    About five miles past the spring we ran into an eastbound rider.  He was in the stinky-dirty-hairy category but had some good information.  There is a bridge out in Kansas and he showed us a detour.  He also said he had had a tailwind the second half of Kansas and was doing 100+ mile days.  Hopefully the winds will swing around for us.  He also had an interesting way of dealing with dogs.  He sprints ahead, does a 180, then charges at them growling.  That might be hard to do on the tandem, so we'll stick to the pepper spray. Next we hit Sommersville and filled out water bottles.  The terrain had become much more rolling now and we were cruising along.  At about 25 miles there was a fire lookout that you were allowed to climb.  I (Rob) climbed up and took a few pictures. It was probably 150ft. high or so.    Outside of Houston we ran into a couple heading East who were from Kirkland, WA.  It was kind of strange running into two people from Seattle in the middle of Missouri. We hit Houston a little after noon.  We had planned on calling it a day but after eating lunch we both felt pretty good.  Additionally, Houston was just a big strip mall and we were going to have to get a hotel.  The next choice was Hartville almost 40 miles away, so away we went. We zoomed along towards Hartville.  The terrain continued to be fun rolling hills.  We stopped at Beaver Creek and took a quick dip to cool off.  It was probably in the mid-90's and was starting to feel hot. The last 14 miles were a little more challenging.  It was probably a combination of the heat, being tired, and the hills got bigger. In Hartville they allow camping on the courthouse lawn in the middle of town.  I checked in with the sheriff and asked if there was shower anywhere in town.  The sheriff moved two inmates in the county jail so we could take showers in one of the jail cells.  She jokingly locked us in to give us the full effect.  I guess after a full day of riding in 90+ heat we must of looked desparate for a shower. After showering we ate a nice dinner of speghetti on the courthouse steps and got to watch the local kids cruise up and down the street in front of us. About five miles before we hit town Mary noticed a rash, like poison ivy, developing on the back of her legs.  It must of happened after swimming.  The rash appeared to be spreading to her upper legs and we started to worry where else it would spread since we always apply gobs of sunscreen all over our bodies regularly, which would spread the rash everywhere.  In a moment of panic she decides it best if we wash everything we have immediately.  She went into the sheriff office to get directions to the laundry. Mary - "Do you know where I can go to do laundry?" Dispatcher - "10-4 .... I'm not from here, let me ask." Man we met earlier out front who had just turned himself in for something accomppanied by his girlfriend who were in the process of hugging and crying - "What is it you need?" Mary - "A laundry mat" Sheriff, who just appeared - "Oh, it's down by the town and county." Mary - "Town and country?" all - dispatcher, sheriff, convict, girlfriend - all pointing down the street - "You know, the grocery store." Mary (kind of meekly) - "Thanks, I think I can find that." Quote of the day - "I have to finish this trip!" - Eastbound rider explaining that after making it through Kansas he had to finish because he would never ride through Kansas again. 
We packed up and were on the road by six.  The first 20 miles or so were hilly but still pretty fun.  We hit Marshfield before 9 and ate breakfast at McDonalds.  It was the most happening McDonalds either of us had ever seen.  There was also a Wal-Mart so we bought new mini-fans to replace our other ones which had both broken. Then we pushed on in the heat.  In hindsight, the worse decision we have made on this trip.  At about 50 miles we stopped at a mini-mart and sat in the AC for about a half hour drinking water.  It was hot. We stopped again at about 60 miles and again at 70 miles to get out of the heat and drink more.  Did we mention it was hot?  At the second place we met a couple who were going east.  They were animals.  They had started in Eugene three days before we had started and had ridden 1000 miles further.  They were funny to talk to though, and had some good stories about the people in front of us going west they had run into. We did the last seven miles and pulled into Ash Grove thinking the day was over.  I (Rob) swam in the city pool and Mary took a cold shower.  Then we headed to the library to get out of the heat.  It was hot, Africa hot. After about an hour in the library Mary said she didn't feel too good.  She looked white and felt nauseaus.  Classic heat trouble symptoms. A quick check with the librarians informed us that the one motel in town was actually closed.  One of them called City Hall to find out if there was anywhere in town we could spend the night out of the heat.  The town clerk offered to open the "Branson House", a community owned rec center, so we could spend the night in there. The town clerk locked up city hall and drove Mary to the house while I pushed the bike there.  15 minutes later was had Mary on a table, feet elevated, ice behind the nect trying to cool her off.  We were grateful for the generosity of letting us use the place. In the meantime I called my brother, Dan, who is my de-facto goto internet travel agent when I don't have a connection.  He started doing a search of U-Haul's in case we needed to drive the big bike home. While on the phone with Dan, Mary is telling me she doesn't feel any better, and if anything is feeling worse.  I call our friend, Liz, who I know had heat exhaustion once to see if she has any advice.  Her advice is to get Mary to the hospital asap and get an IV for her. I call the ambulance and they arrive amazingly fast.  Next thing we know were taking a ride 25 miles up the road to Springfield to a hospital. I can't speak for Mary but I spent the next two hours in the hospital bouncing between feeling dumb for riding so far in the heat, relieved that Mary was going to be okay, and disappointed because it seemed like the trip was over. It turned out that she was slightly dehydrated and very low in potassium (Gatorade didn't do its job!).  They gave her two IV's and some potassium pills and we were out of there. We took a cab to a hotel.  The cab driver was crazy, he had stories about guns in his mouth while driving a cab in Las Vegas, a wife that was hypoglycemic (sp?) that he had to wedge between two slot machines after he hit a big jackpot and she fainted, and his mother who he was preparing to die (whatever that means).  It was a releif to get out of the cab.  We ate some pizza and Mary started looking a normal color again.  After that we went to bed having no idea what we were going to do next. Quote of the day - "You have to get her to the hospital right now and get her an IV!" - Liz (thanks for the advice). 
After much discussion and exploring of options we decided that Mary would fly back to Seattle and I would continue on with the tandem.  Then, depending on how she felt, she would either meet me with the car in Colorado and we would drive the tandem home, or she could meet me sans car and we would ride the tandem home.  This of course was assuming I could actually ride the loaded tandem by myself. We rented a car and drove back to Ash Grove to see if the loaded solo tandem would work.  We re-packed the trailer with just my stuff and I rode around town.  It handled great.  The bike is pretty light and the long wheelbase seems to make it more stable.  I look like a complete freak but I don't know any of these people so what do I care. We locked the bike up and drove back to Springfield (by the way, Springfield appears to be the largest strip mall in the world.  As far as we could tell there was no "town", just one continuous strip mall.)  We hung out in the hotel and got Mary a ticket home. About 4:30 Mary took me back to the bike and I headed out.  It was not a happy moment.  You know in movies when two good buddies are in a bad situation and one of them gets wounded or something.  The non-wounded one never leaves his friend behind no matter what.  Well, I felt like I was leaving my friend behind.  It's in the top 5 worse moments of my life. I rode to Golden City, about 35 miles down the road.  It was hilly at first, but the last 20 miles were pretty flat.  Talking to cows when Mary was on the bike was funny, without her around it just seemed weird.    The only notable part of the ride was the grasshoppers on the road.  There were 1000's of them.  They would wait until the bike was over them and then jump up.  I had a ton of them hitting my legs for miles.  It must of been because I was riding so late in the day. I arrived in Golden City and went to pick up a key to the hostel they have in town.  Mary and I had been hearing about how great the hostel was from every eastbound rider we had passed. While waiting for the guy with the key I noticed a loaded bike across the street at a gathering of people.  I walked over to find the owner.  I ended up getting ivited to the BBQ by the people having it.  I met about 20 people and stuffed myself on chicken, ribs, salad and pasta.  It was great. I talked to one farmer for about an hour.  He was interesting and talked about how he didn't think any of his four kids would be farmers and that he thought that was a good thing.  That seemed kind of sad to me. The bike was owned by a guy named Jesse who was going east and also spending the night in the hostel.  We said goodbye to the party and headed to the hostel.  It was the nicest hostel I've seen.  Washer, dryer, TV, VCR, movies, and a fully stocked kitchen, food and all. Jesse and I did laundry and talked a while.  He was using an old 12 speed Pugeot. It's probably going to be hard going over some of the hills we've done without the third chainring. I finally hit the sack around 11:30. Quote of the day - "I just thought you were a little weird." - Jesse after I explained why I was the only person riding a tandem. 
Just before heading out of the hostel, Jesse gave me a hat with a huge brim that says "I bet mines longer than yours".  He said he thought it was appropriate for me to have since I was riding a tandem.    At the 30 mile mark I hit Kansas.  I kept moving and felt pretty good.  I went through the towns of Pittsburg and Girard.    After Girard the wind did pick up a little bit.  It was pretty much directly out of the south so it was mostly a cross wind.  I did have one 7 mile section where I went north and it took less than 20 minutes with the wind pushing me along. I hit Chanute at 1:30 and headed to the city pool.  It was feeling pretty hot by the time I hit town. It was the best public pool I have ever seen.  It was huge, at least 50m x 25m.  I had five diving boards, one 3m and four 1m.  The best was it had a huge water slide.  Not some little thing, but a full fledged amusement park slide.    I swam for about an hour, sat for a while and then swam some more.  I attracted a lot of attention.  Everyone knew I wasn't from around there so I got a lot of questions. After swimming I headed to the library but it was closed on Sunday.  I then set up camp at a park on the edge of town where camping is allowed. After a quick nap I ate some spaghetti and called it a night. I woke up around 10:30pm to the start of rain.  I quickly threw the fly on the tent and jumped back in to wait it out.  It was a doozy of a storm.  About 11:30 I got out of the tent and went into the men's bathroom which was right next to me.  The lightning was getting a little too close for my comfort.  About 1:30 the lightning finally died off and I crawled back into the tent and fell asleep.  It was still raining pretty hard and did the whole night. Quote of the day - "You're going to use the slide???" - little girl in front of me going up the ladder to the slide.  I was the only person older than 12 using it. 
I fell back asleep and woke up at 7 or so to grey clouds, no wind, and thankfully, no rain.  I got out of the tent to see that our waterproof bag had a three inch puddle of water in the center of it.  Not good.  I opened it and found another inch or so of water inside.  The only real casualty was a batery charger I had for the camera batteries.  Who knows that might work when it dries out.  (I later heard it had rained 2 1/2 inches.) I packed up and ate a quick donut, power bar and OJ breakfast and hussled down the road.  The storm was miserable for sleep but it made the temperatures great today.  It was only 68 as I left town. I rode off the actual 76 route for much of today.  There was a bridge out for part of the route so I did a detour another biker had shown me.  It was a nice road, 12ft shoulder, and freshly paved.  I stopped in the town of Yates Center to refill my water bottles and downed a couple of peanut butter sandwiches.    The next 30 miles was a straight shot west to the town of Eureka.  I ran into a father, son pair just outside of town.  They had spent the previous night in El Dorado and said it had been nice.  It was off route but was a more direct way to get to Hutchinson, which I wanted to visit.  They showed me their route and we said goodbye. I ate a nice lunch in Eureka in a gazebo in front of the town hall.  Then I hit the library and did some email.  They only had a 28.8 dial-up connection so things were moving kind of slow. After the library I went back outside and it wasn't windy, and there was a thermometer that said it was only 82 out.  I figured I would take advantage of the cooler weather and ride to El Dorado. I pulled into the state park a little before 5 and set up camp right on the lake.  There wasn't anyone else there and it wasn't supposed to rain.  I laid everything out to dry which didn't take too long in the sun.  I then took a cold shower, ate a ton of spaghetti and called it a night.  I slept great.    Thought of the day (I didn't talk to too many people today) - "This is a really big country." 
The first ten miles or so were pretty slow due to the darkness but it was nice to get the miles in.  I also got to see a very pretty sunrise over some oil fields.  The number of oil rigs in Kansas has surprised me. I more or less made up my own route today taking the most direct line to Hutchinson.  Most of the riding was on highways but the shoulders are immense so it isn't too bad if you don't mind the loud traffic. Notable highlights of the ride today were passing a couple of feed lots.  The stink stayed with me for about ten miles for each of the two that I passed.  Seeing these places makes me seriously think about eating beef.  They are gross. I also saw a couple of blue herons and a ton of turtles (mostly smooshed from trying to cross the roads). I got to Hutchinson a little before one.  It took me a little while to find the hostel and when I got there I found out that the actual building that used to be the hostel was being demolished in a couple of days.  They no longer had a real hostel but let me stay in the church basement.  It wasn't too bad but they didn't have any showers.  Oh well, just had to be stinky for a while longer. After a sink bath, I stashed my stuff and headed out for lunch.  Hutchinson has 45,000 people in it, so it had a little of everything.  After lunch I hit the bike shop to get some replacement tires.  Ours were wearing out after close to 2000 miles, and the next bike shop is 400 miles away. I had two weird experiences with people asking me stuff I would have no way of knowing. The first was as I was standing on a corner in the middle of nowhere looking at my map.  This guy pulls up in a pickup and asks where the nearest hardware store was.  Why a guy on a bike looking at a map looks like he would have the faintest idea where a hardware store is I don't know. The second was in Hutchinson.  Just as I'm leaning my bike against the hostel.  This woman pulls up and asks me what I'm doing with the stove on the corner in front of the church.  She wants to know if it works and can she take it.  Again, why I looked like I would know anything about that is beyond me. After lunch and the bike shop I went to the Cosmosphere, a space periphenalia museum in town.  It was pretty spectacular.  They had an SR-71 plane, a full size replica of a space shuttle, the Apollo 13 capsule, and this place is the one and only spacecraft restoration facility in the world.  The Smithsonian contracts with them to do all their work.  Kind of weird that it's in the middle of Kansas.    I saw a planetarium show and an IMAX film about Shackelton's adventure.  It was one of the better IMAX films I've seen.  I then tooled around in the museum for a few hours.  It was a great way to kill the day in the air conditioning. After that I headed back to the hostel and there was another couple that had just arrived.  I let them in and we ended up going out to dinner together.  It was nice to have the company.  They were also heading west, but the guy had had so many problems with his bike that he had ordered a new on in Pittsburg, KS and they were going to rent a car the next day to drive back and pick it up before moving on. b>Quote of the day - "I think it's something Speilburg did about the North Pole." - the description I overheard a man tell his wife about the IMAX film we were about to watch.  It was in fact about Shackelton trying to cross the South Pole. 
The route was northwest for the first 11 miles or so, and with the south wind went by fast.  About 8 miles into the ride I passed a bed & breakfast, exotic animal combo.  They had zebra, antelope and camel in front of the house that must of been where you stay.  It looked interesting.  Maybe next time I'm near Hutchinson, I'll check it out.    I stopped in the town of Nickerson and stocked up on water and gatorade.  There was nothing for the next 59 miles, so it seemed like a good idea to be fully loaded with liquid. I headed out dreading going almost 60 miles with nothing to break up the riding.  It turned out to be a nice ride.  There was almost no traffic and the scenery was actually pleasant.  Sublte rolling hills with fields all in various states.    I ran into an eastbound cyclist about halfway into the ride.  We stopped in the middle of the road and talked for about 20 minutes without seeing a single car. About 10 miles later I stopped by the side of the road to eat.  I had a couple of peanut butter sandwiches, or the equivilent.  My bread had been smushed into a big ball, about the size of a volleyball, so I just peeled pieces off, covered them with the peanut butter and muched away.  I would guess it was a couple of sandwiches worth. While eating I had three trucks stop and see if I was okay.  It was nice of them to check up on me, and it made me feel better that if anything did happen, I would probably be able to flag someone down and get help. The wind picked up the last ten miles of the ride, but I got into town before it really got too bad.  Larned was nice.  The downtown actually still had stores that were open.  It also had a huge public pool, with another huge water slide.  That must be the thing to do in Kansas. I found the library and did a quick update to the site.  Then I found a shady spot and ate lunch.  It was starting to feel hot and my lunch confirmed it.  My peanut butter was completely melted into liquid.  So I sat in the shade peeling pieces of bread off my breadball, and dipping them into the liquid peanut butter.  Kind of an interesting way to eat, but I don't think its going to catch on anytime soon. After my second lunch I hit the city pool.  I jumped in and out keeping cool.  Some of the kids were having a make the biggest splash contest so I joined in on that one.  One of my unknown skills is the ability to make very large splashes off a diving board.  (This skill was developed over years in high school, where, after cross country practice our coach would open the pool and we would do nothing but try and make big splashes).  It had been a long time since I had done that, so it was fun. About 7:30 I set up camp and cooked up some dinner.  It was a nice night, not too hot, and not too windy. Quote of the day - "Can you do a gainer?" - kid asking if I could do a type of dive.  I used to be able to, but somewhere along the line I lost my nerve to even try.  I guess getting older creates a healthy fear of things like smashing your head on a diving board. 
A little before dawn I passed Ft. Larned National Historical sight.  It was open yet, but I snuck around the gate to have a quick look.  It was pretty standard old fort type stuff.  I guess it used to be a stop on the Santa Fe trail. About a mile down the road from the fort there was a sign to see some old wagon ruts from the Santa Fe trail.  I thought about going to see them but the idea of going five miles on a gravel road to see some ruts in the ground on a bike wasn't that appealing.  You just don't do that kind of thing on a bike trip.  Five miles might as well be 100. I turned to go north and had a nice tailwind for 20 miles or so.  In Rush Center I headed west on HWY 96.  It looks like I'll be on this road for the next 3 1/2 days.    I stopped at a nice rest area outside of Alexander and had a conversation with a guy about the pedals on our bike.  He had never seen clipless pedals before and was fascinated with them.  He never even noticed that I was riding a tandem bike by myself.  That was kind of refreshing. Just before Ness City the wind did a 180.  It had been blowing from the south, and but swung around to come out of the north in the blink of an eye.  It was amazing to see how fast it could change directions like that. I hit Ness City and passed the 2000 mile mark on the trip.  Yeah!  There was another couple there, who were also heading west.  They had had seven flat tires in the past two days and were both pretty fed up with it.  Actually it was the same tire that had flatted all those times.  I recommended they use a cotton swab inside the tire to find the thorn, or whatever was in the tire.  There must of been something in there for the same tire to flat that many times. After talking to them for a bit I headed to a diner and ate a huge omlett.  After breakfast I hit the mini-mart and filled my water bottles.  The forcast was calling for highs in the 100's but it was only about 80 so I moved on. About 10 miles outside of the city I hit the 100th meridian, the unofficial eastern edge of the Great Plains.  To really show me a good time the wind picked up massivly.  It was howling.  Luckily it was mostly out of the north, and even a little from the west so it was kind of pushing me along.  If it had been a headwind, I would of turned around and spent the night at Ness City. I flew into Dighton with the wind pushing me along.  It had shifted even more so it was now mostly a tailwind.  I seriously thought of moving on but a 100 mile day seemed like plenty.  I did splurge and get a hotel room because I didn't feel like spending the night in the wind.  The hotel was cheap and comfortable and it was a good decision. The weather channel said the wind was 20-30 mph with gusts to 38 from the norhtwest.  No wonder going 20 on the bike had been so easy.  It also said the wind would continue out of the northwest for one more day, so I would have a tailwind the next day as well.  Very good news. I spent the afternoon in the room, watching TV, dosing.  I ate a dinner of bananas, peanut butter (normal consitency, on normal bread this time), and chips.  I didn't feel like going out for another meal, and didn't feel like firing up the stove outside the hotel. I hit the sack early, and slept like a baby. Quote of the day - "Those are some pedals you got there!" - man at rest stop talking about our clipless pedals. 
I left about half past seven and had a great ride.  The road had a nice shoulder and was completely flat.  The wind was pushing me along and the sun was hidden behind some clouds so it was cool. I made it to Scott City about 25 miles down the road in a hour.  I succumbed to the luar of McDonalds and stopped in for some breakfast.  There was a group of older men there and they teased me about being on the bike alone.  They also tried to give me directions so we could avoid the rockies.  They couldn't understand that I was actually looking forward to the mountains. I said goodbye and zipped down the road.  I had been following the rule of drinking one water bottle every ten miles but today I couldn't keep up.  It was effortless to go 25 mph. After Scott City I passed through Leoti and filled my water bottles.  Between Leoti and Tribue the wind started to shift.  It started coming from the south a little more and was blowing a little harder. Until the wind shifted I was having visions of riding a 250 mile day.  It was so easy.  The slight shift brought me back to reality.  I decided to stick with my plan of staying in Tribune.  I thought of moving on to Eads, CO, but that would of been a 130 mile day.  Too much. In Tribune I ran into a couple from Holland I had been hearing stories about for miles.  They are also riding west and have brought everything but the kitchen sink with them.  They are going relatively short days so I guess the extra weight doesn't bother them too much. After talking to them I hit the library and read a Newsweek.  It was nice to get caught up on some news.  Then I did some laundry. I headed to the city park and was surprised to discover the county fair was going to start that night.  There were a bunch of rides, a tractor pull, an animal auction and best of all a free BBQ to kick the whole thing off. I found the couple from Holland and set up camp close to them.  The three of us headed to the BBQ and ate.  They were very interesting to talk to.  This was their first time to the U.S. and they were riding from Miami to wherever they ended up.  They planned on getting to Missoula and then they didn't know where they were going. The best thing about talking to them is how they were really enjoying the trip itself.  The destination wasn't important.  Very different than all the American riders we had met, myself included. After dinner I watched the auction for a while.  Once it got dark I hit the sack.    Quote of the day - "Three days of this would of been plenty.  Okay I get it - Kansas is flat and windy!" - man from Holland talking about Kansas. 
Hitting the road it became immediately apparent it was going to be payback time for the tailwind the day before.  Even at 6:30 it was blowing fairly hard out of the south and occasionally from the southwest.  Not quite a headwind but I did spend most of the day in my granny gear chainring. At 17 miles I said a sad farewell to Kansas and entered Colorado.  Not much changed except maybe the wind was blowing harder. I can't figure out why most of this part of the country isn't covered in windmills.  I'm not sure the wind ever dips below 10 mph.  Instead the place is littered with oil pumps.  I guess that is a better way to make money, but I still think the windmill thing would be a money maker out here. I hit the towm of Sheridan Lake expecting there to be a market.  Instead, most of the town was deserted.  The one gas station in town was closed for the day, and the lake was all dried up.  The place had seen better days. I needed to get some water so I did manage to convince the people at the post office to let me use their sink.  I got lucky because they were about to close for the day (9:30 in the morning?). I got back on the road and fought the wind for the last 30 miles to get to Eads.  Eads was almost as dead as Sheridan Lake.  The main street did have stores but they were all closed. I found the pool and took a quick dip.  I think I was the only person above 15 there.  I'm not sure there were any lifeguards, just a couple of girls who liked to boss the other 10 kids around.  It wasn't a very nice pool, and I was afraid someone was going to get killed in the mayhem, so I just jumped in a cooled off. It took me a while to figure out where camping was allowed.  I was about to set up camp when I noticed there wasn't any water there, and a huge dark storm was blowing in.  I decided to go to the sketchy looking hotel on the edge of town. The hotel was okay and it rained pretty hard but only for about half an hour.  After the rain I cooked up some mac & cheese then turned in.  Only two more days of riding and them Mary is coming back.  I'm looking forward to it. Thought of the day - "This place is dead!" - me thinking about Eads.  I didn't really talk to anyone today. 
I headed down the road and it was slow moving.  About two miles into the ride I noticed that the bob tire was flat.  Almost 2200 miles without a flat so I couldn't complain. It didn't take too long to fix and I was on my way again.  It looked like it had been a pinch flat so I only did a cursory check of the tire.  Things were a little easier going with air in the tire. About 15 miles later I had another flat in the bob tire.  This time I did a thourough search and found a thorn just sticking through the tire.  I patched the tube and while waiting for it to dry I looked at the other two tires on the bike.  They both had thorns in them that hadn't worked into the tubes yet.  I removed them, fixed the bob tire and moved on. In Haswell I stopped and bought a pop from a machine and sat down in the shade to drink it.  This guy pulls up in his pickup and started talking to me.  He only sort of made sense.  He had been a bricklayer in Las Vegas working for the mob, then jumped to the topic of not allowing furniture on porches (something about a fire hazzard), followed by a diatribe about living with a prostitute that wouldn't give him any action.  It was astounding.  All I could think about was the fact that he was driving.  It was a little scary. I finished my drink, said goodbye and left.  He was still talking. In Sugar City I stopped in a market and had an ice cream sandwich.  It was the first week the store had been open.  The owner had moved from Denver and was super friendly and very enthusiastic.  I hope the store works out for her. From there I rode the last ten miles into Ordway.  It felt hot.  I checked into the hotel which is really a hostel.  The woman that runs it was very nice. I sat and talked to her for more than an hour.  She was telling stories about how this used to be a huge sugar and cantelope producing region.  Then the feed lots bought all the water rights and that was more of less the end of the area having any kind of agriculture base.  Now the feed lots have sold most of their water rights to the city of Denver, so they aren't even around. I turned in early and called it a night. Quote of the day - "Don't sit on any furniture on them porches!" - man in Haswell.  I don't know what he was talking about. 
I changed both the tube and the tire (I had bought new tires in Hutchinson waiting to change them when I got a flat).  Then I was off.  I had a quick ride today, the wind was more or less from the south but was really non-existant compared to the previous days. I pretty much rode straight through to Pueblo.  There wasn't actually anywhere to stop even if I had wanted to.  The two towns I went through were more or less closed up. Once in Pueblo I found the bike shop where I dropped the tandem off.  They are going to replace some cables on the bike that are nice and rusty.  The owner of the shop gave me a ride to the car rental place (which was very nice since it would of been about a two mile walk on nasty highway roads).  I got the rental car and started driving to Denver International Airport to pick up Mary. There were some wicked thunderstorms the entire drive up and I figured that might delay her flight a little.  I was right.  She got in about two hours late, but she came and was feeling fine. While waiting I noticed there was a guy in the ticketing area taking a bike apart to fit it in a box.  I started talking to him and it turned out he was planning on flying to Alaska and riding his bike to Tiera Del Feugo (sp?).  I think he said it was about a 16,000 mile trip and he was going to take 16 months to do it.  Pretty crazy.  What was really crazy is his bike was a complete wreck.  I don't think the chain had ever been lubed, the bottom bracket was shot, his front breaks were not attached to the forks, and we couldn't remove the pedals which was a mess because they had to be removed to fit the bike in the box.  He also had no tools except a little do-it-all type tool you take on a two hour mountain bike ride, not on a 16 month epic journey.  He seemed woefully unprepared for the ride he was about to do.  I'm sure he'll learn along the way.  He did however have a copy of War and Peace (hardback of course). We finally managed to get one pedal off, and fit the bike in the box.  I would love to read a journal by that guy.  He did have a lot of duct tape, so I'm sure he'll be able to write a manual about repairing a bike in the middle of nowhere with nothing but duct tape. Mary arrived and we drove off to the Hotel Udovich.  Chris and Kirk are putting us up for a few days.  Then we're off to Peublo to retrieve the bike and away we go! Quote of the day - "I really missed you!" - Rob to Mary as she got off the bike.  I was sick of riding the bike by myself. 
Monday Night Mary feels good, we're planning on riding again by Friday. Tuesday Mary is feeling good in the morning, but as the day goes on she isn't feeling so good.  Not the sort of news either of us was prepared for.  By the end of the day she is light headed and her stomach doesn't feel so great.  We're pretty bummed out, its looking like the trip is off. Wednesday We decide to not panic and start heading home just yet.  We took a trip to Rocky Mountain National Park and decided that seeing things from a car just wasn't going to cut it for the rest of the trip.  Mary still doesn't feel so great.  We went to see Austin Powers with Chris and that cheered us up. Thursday We get the name of Kirk's doctor and he sees Mary that day.  He is the best doctor either of us have ever dealt with.  He actually talked to us for 15 minutes before doing anything.  His prognosis is that Mary has a virus and will be better in a day or so.  We suddenly have some hope.  Went to see Austin Powers with Kirk; it was so good the first time we had to see it again.  It was actually better the second time. Friday Mary goes in for some blood work to make sure she doesn't have Lymes Disease.  We had seen a lot of ticks.  The blood work comes back negative so we think we'll try riding again in a few days.  Mary is feeling better.  We take a trip to Performance Bike Shop and buy a 5 pound canister of cytomax for re-hydrating on the trip. Saturday We head back to Pueblo to pick up the bike and drop off the car.  Thanks to Chris and Kirk for putting up with us for 5 stressful days (we're riding - we're not riding - we're riding .... etc etc etc).  We did see the new XXX movie.  It was entertaining if you can suspend reality for about two hours. Sunday Mary feels great, but we decide to take one more day off just in case.  We did go for a short ride in Pueblo on a bike path.  It turned out to be the worse bike path in the world.  Covered with glass, huge bumpy sections and best of all, sand.  We took the roads back to the hotel and called 11 miles a day. Our plan from now on is to take it very easy.  We might not make it to Seattle, but we'll be able to ride the entire time we have off. 
   We woke up early and looked out the window to some very windy conditions.  A front was moving in and the winds were a steady 30 mph out of the north.  It looked like it was going to be a slow first day back in the saddle. We packed up our gear and headed to Canon City taking HWY 50.  The actual 76 route takes 96 out of Pueblo, but the guys at the bike shop said 50 had a nice shoulder and was probably a better road.  It was a very nice road with a 12 ft shoulder the whole way.    The wind blew pretty hard for the first 10 miles or so.  It didn't blow the bike around nearly as much as it had when I was on the bike alone.  After 10 miles the wind just stopped.  I was glad Mary got to experience how quickly it could change. We stopped at a market about 15 miles into the ride to tank up on Gatorade.  It wasn't very hot but we weren't taking any chances. We moved along fairly quickly after that.  As we got closer to the mountains they became more clear.  It was pretty riding, and very nice for me (Rob) to be out of the flatlands. We hit Canon City by 10:30 and it was nice.  It seemed like the majority of the jobs in the town relied on tourism.  There was a train that takes people up to Royal Gorge and tons of rafting trips on the Arkansas River.  There was also alot of mountain biking to do outside of town. We found the library and to pay some bills online.  Next we hit the bike shop in town to try and adjust Mary's seat.  It required a 2.5 mm hex wrench and we didn't have one. Adjusting the seat turned into a mini project.  The clamp that holds the seat in place was stuck and the guy at the shop had to use a hammer and a chisel to get it loose.  We finally fixed the seat angle and bought a 2.5 mm wrench to be able to adjust it later.  We weren't willing to carry a hammer and chisel so hopefully we will be able to get it loose. We checked into a hotel and spent the rest of the day lounging.  It was great to be back riding together. Quote of the day - "I once rode 70 miles in a pair of jeans.  It made me numb from my hips to my knees." - bike mechanic explaining why it was important to wear the right clothing while riding a bike.  It was a little more information than we needed. 
We rode up to Royal Gorge which seemed to be nothing but a tourist trap.  We decided against making the four mile detour to see the worlds highest suspension bridge.  We thought we would stock up on some food but the market was closed.  Oh well. We moved on knowing it was another 21 miles to the next market.  The riding was great.  We were in the Rocky's now and it was beautiful.  The going was pretty slow though.  We were doing a lot of climbing.    We went a little off route to the town of Guffey where there was a market.  It turned out the market was more like a bar with food items placed in various locations.  It was kind of a scavenger hunt type of shopping. We weren't planning on eating but it seemed like they had pretty good food so we sat down and had some lunch.  The proprieters were very nice and the food was good so it was a good call. After lunch we traveled on to the hostel.  It was in a beautiful setting.  The owner was nice and showed us around.  We decided to stay in the cabin for the night, especially after hearing there were three bears around that liked to visit at night.    We both took a cold water bucket shower and settled in for a nice afternoon of reading and napping.  After climbing from 5300 ft to 9000 ft we were both feeling a little tired. Quote of the day - "Just use that log to lock the door so the bears won't come in the cabin" - owner of hostel explaining how to "lock" the door by putting a log in front of it.  We were a little skeptical that it would actually deter a bear if it really wanted to get in. 
About an hour later the sun peeked over the mountains and it warmed up to the 50's almost instantly.  We decided that was warm enough and took off.  The first six miles of the ride took us over our first bona fide pass, Currant Creek Pass.  It turned out to be relativly easy and we rolled over the 9400 ft mark.    The next 16 miles to Hartsel were mostly downhill and we cruised along.  The scenery was amazing.  For the entire ride we were surrounded by 11,000 - 14,000 ft peaks.  We also passed a few buffalo farms and saw several hawks. In Hartsel we stopped at a cafe and ate a huge breakfast.  It was probably a little more food than we needed and we felt stuffed.  We rolled next door to tank up on some water and then hit the road. We moved on the Fairplay and the ride continued to be beautiful.  The wind picked up out of the north and soon became a nasty headwind.  The wind combined with the steady climb to 10,000 ft made for some slow moving. We pulled into Fairplay and I (Rob) was feeling the altitude.  I had a nice splitting headache and my ears were ringing pretty bad.  We hit the laundry and Mary washed our clothes while I vegitated and tried to recover. After cleaning our clothes we decided to get a hotel.  Our camping options were a couple of gravel parking lots and it was still very windy so a hotel sounded like a better option to both of us.  After a quick nap my headache was gone and we did a little sightseeing. Fairplay is also known as South Park, as in the TV cartoon.  We had to see if there was any South Park periphenalia.  We were beginning to think no one in town had a sense of humor when we found a life size Mr. Hanky.  Mary got a picture of me in front of it.  Classy photo.    Quote of the day - "It's hot as hell in here" - Mary noticing the heat was on in out hotel room.  I just thought I was hot from the altitude and didn't bother to check. The maintenance guy came and fixed it. 
There was a nice bike path from Fairplay to Alma and it was a nice break to be out of the traffic for a little while.  About two miles past Alma the four mile climb to the top of the pass started.  It turned out to be an easy climb.  Compared to some hills in Kentucky it was a mild grade. We hung out at the top for a bit and took the obligatory picture of us in front of the sign.  Then we flew down the hill to Breckenridge.    Show links to this Hide links to this       August 15, 2002   We were initially impressed with Breckenridge but after running up and down the entire length of the town a couple of times looking for the bike shop and then the library it lost a lot of its luster.  It just seemed like one big upscale stip mall with really bad traffic.  We couldn't imagine what it was like during ski season.  It must be a traffic nightmare. We decided to head on the Frisco and get out of Breckenridge.  There was a bike trail between the two towns.  The views were great and it was nice to be riding amongst other bikers using the trail.    We walked through Frisco looking for a grocery store but didn't have much luck.  Finally Mary asked and of course all the useful stores were near the freeway at the edge of town.  We should of known that's where all the bigger stores are these days, easy freeway access is important. We found the grocery store and picked up a ton of food.  We had two meals to cook this afternoon.  Then we tried to find the way to the campground that was supposed to be just out of town.  It was a little difficult.  Bike paths are nice, but they are rarely signed well, so we ended up riding around in circles for about a half hour before finally finding the right trail.  About four miles later we found the campground and home for the night. We set up camp in a shady site and then just hung out for the day.  We changed the rear tire, it was looking pretty bald, and read books.  About six in the evening a couple in the site next to our invited us over for a beer.  We took them up on it.  They were probably in their late 50's and had lived everywhere.  It was fun talking to them for a while. Then we had a guy pull into our campsite and look it over.  When Mary told him we were camping there he got kind of upset and stormed off to the camp manager.  We had picked a spot that was a "pull-through" for large RV's.  He had a large RV and didn't want to have to disconnect his car from the back so he wanted our spot.  The camp manager told him to pick another spot, so we got to keep our site.  We'll have to be more careful in the future to try and avoid the pull-through sites. After the mad RV'er encounter we ate a nice spaghetti dinner and called it a night. Quote of the day - "Can we camp in this spot?" - RV'er who wanted to use our site.    
We followed the bike path along the resevoir and across the dam.  At that point we hit the dreaded construction we had heard about from several well wishers we met along the way.  It was grooved pavement and made for unnerving riding.  It felt like the bike was going to fall over at any second.  Fortunately there was little traffic and only lasted for about two miles.  We were happy thinking it wasn't as bad as everyone had made it seem. Several miles down the road we hit the "real" construction they must of been talking about.  It was terrible.  Basically all pavement was gone, and it felt like mountain biking on the fully loaded skinny tire tandem.  It was funny later on looking back on it but at the time it was stressful.  Additionally, there was several miles of single lane road so we were in a large stream of cars with people in them tired of waiting for the construction.  We had to go a lot faster than either of us would of liked considering the road condition.  Fortunately we made it through all of the road work and then got a flat tire.  It was a simple change to the front wheel, and considering the bad road it was amazing all three tires didn't flat several times.  Most amazing is that not a single eastbound rider had said anything about this construction.  I guess a few weeks on the road toughens most to adapt to anything and then move on.    We reached Kremling, stopped at the library, grocery store and Mrs. Z's restaraunt for lunch.  It was popular; even the ice cream truck driver stopped there. We headed 7 miles out of town to a campground in warmer temperatures (90 compared to 40 this morning).  We are not sure how the campground got its name, but it should have been called WINDY.  or RIDICULOUSLY WINDY.  We hung out in the strong winds from about 1 pm until sun down.  The wind could be likened to riding on a highway in a jeep.  We are not sure why anyone without a vehicle would choose to stay there, but they did - no trees, gravel, pseudo stonehenge shade makers and sage grass.    We plan to get an early start tomorrow to try and beat the wind before it starts growing to strong. Quote of the day - "You should of stayed at the RV park in Kremling.  They have nice shaded spots for tents there" - manager of the super-windy campground.  It was too late for that advice, we weren't going to backtrack seven miles for a little shade. 
We climbed a short pass, Muddy Pass, and could see Rabbit Ears Mountain in the background (two small rock formations that sprouted out of the top of the mountain looking like rabbit ears).    We turned off highway 40 onto highway 14 for the last 35 miles of the ride and figured we had about 3 1/2 hours of riding in front of us.  Instead we zipped along on a great downhill and tailwind that allowed us to average about 18 mph the last 35 miles.  We flew through the desert landscape.  Riding at its best. We saw prairie dogs, antelope and very few cars.  We pulled into the Roundup Motel just before 11 and were able to check in for an afternoon out of the elements.  (The wind was really taking its toll).  We bought some used books from the library at $0.25 each, bought groceries to make some tacos and did laundry.  It was a good day in Walden. There was a forest fire near Steamboat Springs that blew pretty heavy smoke into town.  It was difficult to breathe.  We were glad to have the hotel room.    Quote of the day - "Yep, the fires out here are all because of the environmentalists." - owners of the hotel very sure that the current fire situation had nothing to do with the EXTREME DROUGHT Colorado is experiencing. 
We slept in and took a nice walk through the town.  It was a nice morning but the forest fires were still blanketing the sky with nasty smoke. After that we changed rooms, then hung out and watched a lot of TV. All in all a great relaxing day. 
We passed through the town of Cowdrey and then hit the Wyoming state line.  We had gone 22 miles in a little over an hour.  While stopped at the state line we noticed we had a tail wind.  Nice!    The next 30 miles were awesome.  Mostly downhill, and a tailwind.  Probably the definition of bike touring heaven. We stopped in the town of Riverside at 9:30.  We were 50 miles into the ride and had planned on spending the night but the wind made the riding so easy we decided to move on. We ate some breakfast at a cafe in Riverside.  The food was excellent but the waitress acted like we were interupting something she was doing.  We also got to overhear another conversation about those damn environmentalists and the fires. On the way to Saratoga we ran into a father and his two sons who were riding east.  They were packed superlight and were trying to make it across the country in 40 days.  The father was sort of manic, jumping from one topic to the next without as much as breathing.  Mary and I were wondering where we could get some of the drugs he seemed to be on.  His sons were both dragging a little bit.  It seemed like their dad was beating them into the ground. We pulled into Saratoga and went to the hot springs in town.  They were hot but also kind of dirty.  Since we didn't have access to a shower we decided against taking a dip.    Then we moved on to Saratoga Lake for the night.  It was a nice little lake.  There wasn't much shade but we managed to stay cool by jumping in the water for a bit and moving the tent every 30 minutes to stay in the shadow of the one tree in the park. We were entertained watching a family of four take turns on a jet ski in the tiny lake.  They would go out about 100 yards then turn around and come back so the next one could go for a spin.  It seemed kind of pointless. Quote of the day - "So far we're averaging 98 plus ... I'm 51 and have more endurance than my sons ... look at that rear axle, its strong ... this bike was made by a tandem maker ... we're hoping to finish in 40 days ..." - all said franticly with little notice of our response. 
The alarm went off at 5:30 and it was still raining lightly and it was windy so we decided to sleep in.  We woke up again at 7:30.  The rain had stopped but it was windy.  We packed up and headed down the road. The first 20 miles were easy as the wind was mostly at our backs.  The animal highlite of the day was having a bald eagle fly across the road about 50 ft above us.  They are big birds when you see them that close. Then we turned west and things got bad.  We had to ride 13 miles on interstate 80 which would of been okay but the first seven miles were under construction.  We rode on the closed road for a bit, but when we hit the actual construction we had to ride on the narrow shoulder right next to the highway traffic.  It was a little nerve wracking because the wind was blowing us all over the place.    We made it through the construction and struggled against the wind into Sinclair.  We stopped in a diner for breakfast, glad to be out of the wind for a few minutes.  Mary had a five or six year old boy who wouldn't leave her alone until she said hello to him.  She was saved by an older woman who thought he was cute. The next 10 miles into Rawlins were not fun.  The wind exacted its pound of flesh for the past few days of tailwinds.  It was a struggle to hold the bike steady.  Fortunately there wasn't any traffic. We pulled into a hotel in Rawlins and were very happy to be out of the wind.  The weather channel said it was 29 mph sustained winds with gusts up to 39 from the southwest.  Not pleasant when your going west. We ran into a couple of women who were riding the great divide mountain bike trail.  They were as sick of the wind as we were.  It sounded like they had been out of civilization for three days and were desperate for a shower. We visited the library and then ordered a pizza for dinner.  The wind was blowing so hard we couldn't light out stove.  It was a good end to a rough day. Quote of the day - "Yeah, we noticed we had a tailwind" - man at diner.  We asked if he was riding a bike.  No.  It was blowing so hard he had noticed it in his car. 
The first 10 miles were a little slow as we fought a crosswind and climbed over the continental divide. We dropped into the Great Basin and thankfully the wind died down.  We had a nice ride across the basin and then out the other side over the continental divide again.    At Muddy Gap the Wyoming dept. of transportation had a nice grove of trees.  We stopped and ate lunch in the first real trees we have seen in days.  A real treat. After Muddy Gap we turned west towards Jeffrey City.  The winds were still calm and it was nice traffic free riding. We stopped at Split Rock, a natural landmark on the Oregon Trail.  While stopped the wind found us.  The last eight miles were rough.  The wind was strong and it took us about an hour. Jeffrey City was a ghost town.  There used to be a uranium mine nearby, but that closed a while ago so the only thing left is a bar and the post office.  We stopped at the bar and had some ice cream.  Then we headed to the city park for the night.  It was just an old picnic shelter next to the highway.  It did provide shelter from the wind so we set up camp and hung out for the afternoon.    The only real adventure for the day was going to the bathroom.  There was a porta-john at the picnic shelter which did not have a door and faced the highway.  We tried to time our use with no traffic, but of course there were always cars going by.  Nothing to do but wave and laugh. About 6:30 another couple, Dave and Rebecca showed up who were riding east.  They had fought wind and hail most of the day.  That made us thankful that all we had to deal with was eight miles of headwind.  They had planned on starting their trip a month earlier, but Rebecca had been hit by a car and had a broken wrist. While talking to them we noticed that a fire had started in the ridge directly behind the city.  We weren't sure if we were in any kind of danger and being in the ghost town we weren't too sure anyone would come to the picnic shelter to warn the bikers they needed to get out of town.  The couple said they had talked to a guy in a store about 20 miles away and he said Jeffrey City wasn't in any danger.  We decided to spend the night. We talked to for a while swapping stories of what to expect next then went to bed early. Quote of the day - "Hard to believe that bike touring wasn't able to sustain the economy of Jeffrey City" - Rob commenting about the lack of businesses in town. 
   About 20 miles down the road we encountered the guy who Dave and Rebecca said they had seen and was riding the same direction they were, but had refused to talk to them.  He opened up to Rob and the bits of conversation I (Mary) overheard didn't really make any sense.  After a debreifing with Rob later (we met at a rest area and I had headed straight to the bathroom), it was confirmed that he wasn't really making sense. Rob: So how is the wind as we continue? Man: I'm not going to tell you any bad news. Rob: Well, it isn't going to keep us from going, we were just curious. Man: Nope - what you need to do is stare at two straight lines in the rock and not anything else. Rob: Okay????? Man: Yeah, just follow the Columbia; that's what I did.  Great bike shop in Lewiston! Rob: Okay, I've got to go now. Note that that guy was in full cotton sweats (not typical), and his entire shirt front was soaking wet. The rest of the ride was mostly downhill with mild wind (YEAH!).  As we rode the terrrain changed from bland to red rock formations and mountains.  It was becoming pretty.    We entered Lander a little before 11 and stopped for lunch.  Everything was so green.  We found out they were not in a drought.  Probably the first place we have been all summer where people didn't talk about how they needed rain. After three sets of bad directions we found the public library.  They were having a party for the reading club out front and the woman in charge was stirring a huge bucket of what looked to be dry ice.  Interesting.  I (Mary) took a nap at the picnic table across the street (under the guise of watching the bike) while Rob updated the web site. Lander was a nice town.  We were surprised to learn it is the headquarters of NOLS (National Outdoor Leadership School).  After a grocery store visit we headed nine miles out of town to camp.  There were two campgrounds to choose from and we probably made the wrong choice to get a few more miles down the road. First, there was absolutely no shade where the tents could be set up.  We had to hang out at the front porch for the afternoon to try and get out of the sun. Second, surprisingly, it was windy. Third, "Ski" the dog that lived at the campground peed on our front painier, so everytime he came outside we had to follow him around to make sure he didn't do more damage to our stuff.    For sure a hotel tomorrow. We hung out in the shade until sun down then cooked a quick dinner and jumped in the tent for a good nights sleep. Quote of the day - "Were you in Lander earlier, I almost hit you with my red truck at the first light in town." - owner of campground.  We couldn't tell if he was making a joke or being serious.  We had no recollection of almost being hit, so it was probably a joke. 
When we started riding it was a nice day.  The first 35 miles went by quickly. We passed by Crowheart Butte, a rock formation that jutts about 700 ft about the Wind River.    We stopped in the town of Crowheart for some snacks and then headed on to  Dubois (pronounced DO-boys). We continued riding through the WINDY River Reservation, along the WIND river, next to the WINDY mountain range.  About five miles outside of Crowheart the weather started to get nasty. The wind picked up and was directly out of the west.  There were also some nasty looking clouds in the distance ahead of us. The last 30 miles of the ride were brutal.  We were working extremely hard just to move forward.  Then, as an added bonus we were hit with rain and hail. We limped in Dubois and practically collapsed into a hotel room. We went out for Mexican after some power naps and then called it a day. Thought of the day - Wyoming has pretty much beat the crap out of us so far. 
We packed up quickly and were on the road by 8:30.  On the way out of town we noticed Dubois seemed to be into extrememly large renditions of wild animals.  They had an enormous black bear, a huge moose, and a giant trout all in front of various businesses.  The best was a horse sized fake jackalope inside a convienence store that you could sit on and take pictures of. The riding was nice mostly because the wind was minimal.  We met an eastbound rider about five miles outside of town.  It was amazing to still see eastbound riders this late in the year. The next 25 miles we climbed over Togwatee Pass.  It was probably the steepest pass we've gone over in the Rockies.  There was a beautiful lake at the top of the pass.  In fact the whole ride today was getting prettier.  It was nice to be amongst pine trees again after a week of nothing but sage brush.    Once over the pass we flew along for the last 20+ miles.  Best of all the Tetons came into view.  They were a magnificent backdrop to the last half of the day.    We pulled into a campground with an excellent view of the mountains.  After a dip in the pool and hot tub we relaxed for the afternoon.  The relaxing consisted of visiting the mini-mart store at the campground repeatedly.  The people at the store must of thought we were feeding a family of 20 with the amount of food we bought.  We're still not sure why we couldn't of bought everything we needed in one trip. To end the day we were treated to a great sunset over the Tetons.    Quote of the day - "Do you need to ka-ka or do you want to go in the pool?" - father repeatedly asking his son what he wanted to do.  We voted for the ka-ka before going in the pool. 
We fell back asleep and didn't get up until the sun hit our tent at almost 8.  We took our time packing up and Mary made one more trip to the store for breakfast. We finally headed out about nine.  The ride was great for about three miles then we hit construction.  At the gatehouse to get into the Grand Teton National Park the ranger informed us it was National National Park Day so we could get in for free.  This seemed good, but also bad.  Free entrance probably meant more traffic. The first eight miles of riding in the park were under construction but it wasn't as bad as the pseudo mountain biking we had done in Colorado.  Once that was over we were able to enjoy the rest of the ride in the park on a narrow shoulder.  The views were beautiful and the riding was pleasant.    Next we exited the park and rode the seven miles between the Grant Tetons and Yellowstone.  The shoulder disappeared but it was a nice decent so were were able to fly along and the traffic wasn't too bad yet. Then we hit Yellowstone.  By far the worse traffic we have had on the entire trip.  The road was very narrow, no shoulder, and a majority of the vehicles on the road were massive RV's.  No one seemed to understand the pedal to the left was the break. We only had a few people drive too close.  Instead most of the drivers would swerve into oncoming traffic without so much as hitting their breaks to get around us.  It seemed like there was a near head-on collision every few minutes the entire time we were in the park.  All in all it was very difficult to enjoy scenery because it seemed like we were going to cause a fatal accident at any moment. The one time we were glad there were some cars in the park was when there was a big male bison lumbering down the opposite side of the road towards us.  People slammed their breaks on for that one.  A couple of guys in a 4-runner let us cower behind their truck as we went by the animal.  It was nice to have a couple tons of steel between us and the bison. It started us thinking it is amazing people will come to a grinding halt for a wild animal but won't so much as tap their breaks for a couple of people on a bike.  Maybe the threat of damage to their car is what makes them slow down.  It seems like cyclists could come up with some sort of marketing campaign that would make people want to slow down and take our picture.  Maybe riding naked. The rest of the ride was more of the same.  Terrible traffic, great scenery when would could actually look at it.    We pulled into Grant Village, nerves shot.  We ate at the restaraunt, bought some groceries and headed to the campground. We set up camp in the nicest site we've had all trip.  Woods all around, soft place to put the tent.  A good end to a bad day. We had both been looking forward to Yellowstone, but in reality, National Parks have evolved to be enjoyed from cars / RV's.  Bike touring just isn't very pleasant. We both decided we might come back sometime in a car and try to enjoy it a little more. Quote of the day - "Today is National Park Day, so you don't have to pay to get in." - Ranger at the entrance station.  We would of gladly paid a ton of money to stop the flow of RV's in the park.    
We slept in and the walked to the restaraunt for breakfast.  We enjoyed a great view of Lake Yellowstone while eating.  Then we hung out at the campsite until close to noon, packed up, and visited the visitor center.  They had a big exhibit on the 1988 fire that burned in 2/3 of the park. Around 1:30 we decided we would risk the 20 mile ride to Old Faithful.  If the traffic was too bad we would stop and wait it out.  It turned out to be a great ride.  There was a very small shoulder and the traffic was significantly lower. We rode over the continental divide two more times en-route to Old Faithful.  The riding was nice but it did rain on us a bit.    We hit Old Faithful and waited about an hour to see the geyser.  It was fun to people-watch.  Our bike attracted a lot of attention.  We've become used to it, but it made us realize it isn't exactly normal looking with the fully loaded bob. The geyser was amazing.  Definitly a highlite.  After, we headed down the road.  It continued to have a small shoulder and was mostly downhill.  We passed through fields of geysers and hot springs.  It was a surreal landscape.    From Madison Junction to West Yellowstone we saw a ton of elk hanging out near the Madison River.  We were hoping to see a moose but the elk were interesting also.    We crossed into Montana, our eighth state, and rolled into West Yellowstone.  Then it took a little while to find a place to stay.  The first couple of hotels we tried either didn't have anyone on the lobby to help us, or we couldn't find the lobby.  It was like the place was deserted.  On the third try we found a hotel with a lobbey, with someone working in it and checked in for the night. We went out for pizza and then called it a night. Quote of the day - "Oh, this one has a lobbey and someone in it.  Let's stay here!" - Mary getting excited that a hotel would actually take our money for the night. 
We slept in, watched TV, read the paper and finally ventured out close to noon.  We ate chineese and then went to the IMAX theater in town.  We saw a movie on bears.  It was pretty good, not too hoaky.  It made us glad we hadn't seen any bears while in the park. After the movie we stopped in a bike shop and in a moment of weakness decided we needed to get some clean water bottles.  Ours had been with us for more than 3000 miles and were growing some kind of unknown culture in them.  We invested in eight new ones.  Funny how something so little can make us both so happy.  (Note: we've had the new water bottles for five days now and we both feel much better.  We were probably slowly poisoning ourselves with the stuff growing in our old bottles.)    Then we went back to the room and relaxed for the rest of the day.  We used the hotel's communal kitchen to cook dinner and while doing that a really nasty storm showed up.  It hailed some decent sized hail for about 20 minutes.  It made us even more glad we had taken the day off. 
We left at 7:30 and it wasn't too cold or windy.  We were looking forward to the ride since it was supposed to be mostly downhill.  The riding was pretty and traffic was minimal as we headed out of West Yellowstone. We stopped at Quake Lake (a lake that was formed in August of 1959 by a 7.5 magnitude earthquake that clogged the Madison River) visitor center.  After a quick look at the exhibit and a visit to the foulest smelling bathrooms ever  (the stink was still in our noses 10 minutes after exiting the bathrooms) we headed down the road.    We made excellent time despite an annoying but not too strong headwind.  We stopped for lunch in the one-building bar / market / hotel / post office town of Cameran and learned that the wind was normally from the south, but just for us was out of the north for the day.  Just our luck. We finally stopped at a nice RV park in Ennis (like Tennis).  The best feature was a Dairy Queen across the street.  The sky threatened all afternoon and we ended up eating a hasty chewy spaghetti dinner due to our fear it would rain at any moment.  It was topped off with some yummy blizzards at the DQ. Quote of the day - "Are you riding that bike with your girlfriend?" - group of teenage boys at the Quake Lake Visitor Center that were swarming around our bike as we got ready to go.  They were very curious and impressed with the whole trip, but mostly they were impressed with our eight water bottles. 
The first ten miles of the ride was a 2000 ft climb up over a pass.  It was slow moving especially after moving along at close to 20 mph most of the previous day. We climbed over the top and zoomed into Virginia City.  We ate breakfast at a cafe in town.    Then we moved on towards Twin Bridges.  The riding was mostly downhill and we made good time.  A storm blew in as we were leaving town.  It gave us a nice tailwind so we just kept riding in the rain for a while.  It blew past us and changed into more of a headwind, but it was nice while it lasted. The last 20 miles of the ride we climbed over Pipestone Pass.  It was another 2000 ft. climb and at the end of a 90 mile day it was tough.  We also had to deal with another flat tire on the bob.  That's a total of five.  This time there was a small piece of metal that had sliced through the tire. We pulled into Butte feeling pretty beat.  There was a huge thunderstorm closing in on us also, so we just wanted to get out of the weather.  We checked into a hotel just as the sky opened up. Quote of the day - "On the map it shows this Silverbow campground before Pipestone Pass, why don't we stay there" - Rob thinking we could end the day about 15 miles before we did.  The campground never materialized, so we ended up having to go all the way to Butte. 
We took full advantage of the continental breakfast in the hotel before heading out.  The first 20 miles of the ride were on the interstate which was actually very nice riding.  There was a huge shoulder, it was mostly downhill, and the traffic was pretty light considering we were on a major highway. We had to deal with a little construction including the exit we needed to take being closed.  We decided to take it anyway and it turned out to be fine.  One advantage to a bike is you can usually skirt by any closed roads. Our next stop was in the town of Anaconda.  We stocked up on food and ate lunch in a park across from the store.  We had a couple of kids who were hitting golf balls come over and ask how far we could drive a golf ball.  They didn't understand that we had no idea how far we could hit a golf ball.  After hitting the golf balls for a while they must of been bored because then they started throwing their clubs at each other and at the shelter in the park.  We decided it was time to get out of there before we got hit with a golf club. On the way out of town we stopped at Sven's Bike Shop to get a new tire for the Bob.  We've had a total of six flats (one this morning) and the tire was shot.  Can't complain too much, we got about 4000 miles out of the tire. The last 15 miles were great riding along HWY 1.  It had a nice shoulder, minimal traffic and was a designated scenic drive. We ended the day at Georgetown Lake at a campground.  We set up the tent and had to immediately get in to avoid a thunderstorm.  It blew over fairly quickly so we were able to cook dinner.  Another storm blew in after dinner and kept up for most of the night.    Quote of the day - "Shade! You don't need shade!" - woman at the campground explaining why the tent sites had no trees.  I guess she thought everyone who camps in a tent must love sweating to death in the sun in their tent. 
The riding was great coming out of the campsite.  Huge pine trees, a deep canyon with a waterfall and a fun steep decent made for a lot of fun.    We continued downhill going through the town of Phillipsburg (saffire captiol of Montana or something like that), and then onward to Drummand.  We stopped at an interesting cafe in Drummand for lunch.  It was also the bus depot, a video rental shop, and apparently the place in town to hang out smoke, and make personal phone calls.  All in all a very strange atmosphere. The food was good though, and the milkshakes were excellent.  As we walked out of the cafe we ran into a couple of Mormons.  They were so fascinated with our bike and our trip they never even tried to convert us.  As we were talking to them we noticed a huge storm bearing down on the town. We used the storm as an excuse to get out of there before the conversion talk began.  We zipped along a frontage road next to I-90 and got away from the storm.    The frontage road was nice while it lasted, but it dead ended about 17 miles later.  We had to hop on the freeway for about 15 mils.  Again it wasn't too bad with the big shoulder, but the winds started blowing in our faces so we slowed down quite a bit. We got off I-90 in Clinton and rode another frontage road until about five miles outside of Missoula.  Then we had to get back on the highway for the last few miles.  Not too bad except for two bridges we had to cross that had NO SHOULDER! We would ride to the edge of the bridge and then sit and wait for traffic to stop coming and then sprint across the bridge as fast as we could go.  For anyone who has never ridden a fully loaded tandem, it is very difficult to get up to any kind of speed from a dead stop.  We managed to go from 0 to 30 in about 30 yards on both bridges.  The fear of death can get your butt moving when it has to. After the two bridges we were pretty wiped out so we were very happy to get off the highway and roll into town. We decided a near 100 mile day deserved a hotel.  We checked in and then did laundry at the coolest laundramat of the trip.  It had F-R-E-E soap, free internet access and a comfy couch to sit and watch tv.  We gave the Green Hanger five stars for laundry facilities. After dinner at Pizza Hut (our pizza sponsor of the trip - two out of three pizza's eaten on this trip have been Pizza Hut) we hit the sack. The hotel did have a vibrating bed but I (Rob) didn't want to make Mary car sick so we just went to sleep. Quote of the day - "This didn't seem like that kind of hotel." - Mary's reaction to seeing the vibrating bed. 
We stopped at Adventure Cycling Association's headquarters, but it was Sunday so they were closed.  We probably would of taken the day off to visit but they were going to be closed for Labor Day as well and we didn't want to take two days off.    The riding was slow today because we were fighting a headwind from the start and we were more of less climbing from the start. We passed through the town of Lolo and started moving towards Lolo Pass and Idaho.  We had heard traffic could be bad on HWY 12 but it was actually light for us.  Mostly people cruising around on motorcycles. We stopped at a picnic shelter and ate lunch.  It felt like we were back in the Pacific Northwest with the big evergreens and the lush ferns all over the place. Next we stopped at Lolo Hot Springs.  It was actually a pool filled with hot water from the springs.  After Yellowstone it was kind of anti-climatic.  For Mary the highlite was going to the bathroom.  They must of used the hot water from the springs to fill the toilets.  She came out very excited that the toilet water was toasty and steaming.  Ahhh... the little things.  Rob didn't get to try because the one men's stall was occupied. From there we climbed over Lolo Pass and entered Idaho.  We were very disappointed that there was not a sign welcoming us to a new state.  Idaho is lame.  We also entered the Pacific Time Zone so we are now are Seattle time.    We zipped down the other side of the pass and stopped at a market to get some rope to hang our food.  They didn't have any.  We decided we would ask someone at the campground to store it in their car for us.    We got to the campground and then it dawned on us that it was the Sunday of Labor Day weekend.  Not good timing for trying to get a campsite.  We got lucky and grabbed the last one in the park. We set up camp next to the river and then soaked our legs.  It turned out we didn't need to hang our food so we lucked out on that one as well. Quote of the day - "Yeeee hawwwwww!" - group of motorcyclists screaming out as we passed them coming down the pass.  This was accompanied with vigourous arm pumping.  (They were stopped in a rest area, we weren't coming down the pass fast enough to overtake motorcycles.) 
It turned out to be an amazing ride.  The entire ride was downhill, literally.  I was even better because the traffic was practically non-existant.  The only vehicle we noticed was a blue corvette with silver flames that passed us several times.    We made it to Lowell and stopped at a cafe for a late breakfast.  We had gone 60 miles in a little over three hours.  The blue corvette was parked out front and as the guy who owned it drove away the guys in the booth next to us mocked it for looking like a hot-wheels car. We pulled into the campground and it was another great site.  It was right on the Clearwater River, complete with a sandy beach.  We took a quick dip in the cool water and then spent most of the afternoon figuring out what was going on in the campsite next to ours.    There were about seven women, two men about about 15 kids, all dressed like it was against the law to show any skin.  In the end we decided it must be a polygamous marriage cult or something.  In addition to the weird male / female ratio they had a huge camper with a buick skylark parked like it had towed it into the site.  We could not figure out how a car that little had pulled such a big camper.  In the end we were disappointed when they used a big pick-up truck to take the camper away. We built a fire and made s'mores before heading to bed.  It was the first fire we built on the entire trip, mostly because it was the first place we had stayed that wasn't in an extreme drought. Quote of the day - "What is that supposed to be, a hot-wheel?" - guys at cafe mocking the blue corvette with silver flames. 
We had a great breakfast of oatmeal and hot chocolate (new mugs we had bought the day before).  It was the first warm morning we had had in a while which made it even nicer, although it was ironic since we actually we able to drink hot liquid for a change. We packed up and headed out for a short day to Kooskia (pronounced KOO-ski).  We were hoping the short distance would make it seem almost like a day off.  The riding continued to be downhill with light traffic but the gnats were terrible.  Within minutes of riding Rob was covered with little black bugs and it was pretty gross.  Another fringe benefit for Mary riding in the back, not as many bugs.  They continued for the entire ride which made us glad it was a short day.    We hit construction just before town but fortunately bypassed most of it when the flagger gave us a tip for getting into town by taking the first bridge.  The traffic was limited to one lane so we were surprised to see another couple coming towards us on bikes. The standard reaction when you see other bikers is to slow down and say hello.  Instead they just cruised right past us.  Strange.  Strange in many ways actually, why were they heading east so late in the year, why were they going against traffic in a construction zone that was one way, and why didn't they stop.  Probably because they noticed Rob was covered from head to toe in gnat guts. Upon reaching town we scored.  We were able to check into a hotel room at 10 AM and it was only $30 for the night and it had a kitchenette.  The grocery store, laundry, post office, hair stylist, and best internet access of the whole trip were all one block away.  Two thumbs up for Kooskia.  People were very friendly. At the grocery store we had a mild moment of panic when we noticed they didn't take ATM cards and we didn't know if we had enough cash.  Mary ran to the ATM and it wasn't in service.  Fortunately we had just enough cash to cover the costs. After that we hit the bank to get some travelers checks cashed.  The teller gave us all kinds of helpful info.  Where to eat, where to get Mary's hair cut, where to access the internet. Mary got her hair cut, Rob went to get online.  Later in the day we were able to pick up a package Rob's Mom had sent with AAA Washington information.  We didn't really think we would make it this far and suddenly we realized we needed more information on Washington.  Thanks Mom. We cooked up a good dinner in the hotel room, and called it a night.  It almost felt like a day off. Quote of the day - "People just don't give a rats finger about me!" - man in a commercial advertising something.  We were laughing too hard to notice what was being advertised. 
The scenery continued to be great but we couldn't enjoy it.  Route 12 turned out to be a nightmare.  The riding conditions were horrible.  There were semi trucks coming both directions continously.  To make it worse the road was along a winding river, and there was a three foot concrete wall about 10 inches away from the edge of the road.  It was more or less impossible to get out of the way of any kind of trafic.  At the end of 70 miles of this our nerves were shot.    We would our way through Lewiston and crossed the Snake River into Clarkston and our tenth state, Washington. We ran into another couple, Jesse and Beth who had started riding in Michigan and were going to Eugene.  They were actually moving to Eugene and everything they owned was on their bikes.  Certainly a strange way of moving. We invited them into our motel room and hung around swapping stories about our trips.  They had gone off route from the Adventure Cycling maps quite a bit so they had seen a lot of different stuff from us. We chilled out in our room for the night and hoped to have no more riding like today. Quote of the day - Just a long string of expletives from Rob getting totally frustrated with the road and traffic. 
The first ten miles of riding out of town were nice.  The road had a wide shoulder as it would next to the Snake River.  We also had a nice paper mill aroma which added to our pleasure. The next 12 miles or so we started climbing and went over Alpowa Summit.  The last seven miles were some of the steepest climbing we had done in a while.  We started down the other side and it started to rain.  It was only about 50 out, and the rain was cold.  It was a nice welcome to Washington.    We stopped at a cafe in Pomeroy.  We were hoping to wait out the rain but had no such luck.  We ate and then continued down route 12 which lost its shoulder just outside of town.  We were having flashbacks to the previous day. Luckily we turned off route 12 about ten miles out of town and it turned out to be a beautiful road.  As an added bonus the rain stopped and the sun came out. The last 20 miles of the day was great riding.  Almost no traffic, nice ups and downs.  We stopped in the town of Starbuck and the mini-mart.  The owner and one of the patrons sat and talked to us for quite a while.  They were both interesting and nice. We spent the night at Lyons Ferry State Park.  It was a great park, but sadly it will be closed at the end of the month permanently due to budget cuts.    For some excitement Mary got scared to death by a huge spider that crawled out of the shower drain.  It was about six inches across, with a body about the size of a half dollar. We cooked dinner and had a big owl hang out about 20 feet away.  It was the closest either of us had ever been to an owl.  It had big eyes and tufts coming off the tops of its ears, so it looked a little like our cat Sparky. Quote of the day - "Eiahhhh!" - Mary screaming at the top of her lungs when the spider crawled out of the shower drain. 
   After the first big climb we had some good up and down riding with more downs than ups.  We made good time to Connel and stopped at the mini-mart for lunch.  As we were sitting out front eating it seemed like the entire high school showed up for lunch.  They were all driving tricked out Hondas.  Most of them were going for the double corn dog lunch.  Our diets have been pretty bad for most of this trip, but we've never succomed to the mini-mart meat lunch. We continued on to Othello after lunch.  There was another big climb coming out of Connel.  We started riding through big potato fields and there were a lot of potato trucks flying by. The last 20 miles into Othello was along highway 17.  It was a busy road but there was a big shoulder so it didn't seem too bad. In Othello there were no camping options so we opted for an inexpensive hotel.  After doing laundry and eating dinner we sat and watching KING 5 news.  It made us realize that we were getting close to Seattle. 
We had to climb up over a ridge and then dropped down into another valley that was the edge of the Hanford Nuclear Site.  We had climbed up through huge apple orchards, but the drop into the valley was pretty desolate.  We were able to see Mount Adams in the distance which was exciting.    As we continued down the road the traffic started getting heavier and heavier.  It was okay at first, but we started to loose our shoulder.  About 30 miles into the ride we lost the shoulder completely. We had to deal with heavy truck traffic for the next ten miles.  We were basically riding down the road and either cringing as each truck drove by, or for the times there were trucks going both ways we would pull off the road into the thick gravel.  It wasn't very nice riding. The straw that broke us was the bridge crossing the Columbia.  It was another huge bridge with a very small shoulder.  We had to sit and time our crossing when there weren't any trucks coming along. We sprinted across the bridge and pulled into a rest area about 40 miles outside of Yakima.  The longer we sat there watching the traffic the more depressed we got.  It was going to be a miserable and dangerous last 40 miles to Yakima. In the end we decided that we didn't really want to get back on the road.  We made a call to some friends in Seattle (Stacey and Aram) who were unfortunate enough to be home when we called.  They agreed to get our car and come get us out in the middle of the state. We sat around the rest area for about three hours waiting for them to show up with the car.  It was a depressing feeling.  We both felt like we were giving up, but every time we looked at the road we didn't want to get back on it. Stacey and Aram showed up, we put the tandem on the top of the car and drove the last 200 miles back to Seattle.  Not quite the end we had envisioned, but it felt great to be home. Quote of the day - "Stacey, are you busy today?" - Rob asking for a ride home.  Kind of a sad moment, but certainly safer. 
After riding our bike across the country and having a great time, we decided we would make some sweeping generalizations.  It was good to see that there are still pockets in the U.S. that have their own uniqueness.  No McDonalds, no Wal-Mart.  Of course most of these places are very small and we wouldn't want to live there, but its nice to know they exist.  It was also nice to see that the majority of people are kind and helpful. Neither of us had any life changing epiphanies on the trip.  We did decide that taking a serious chunk of time off from normal life is a great thing.  We'll do it again sometime. Milestones we were excited and proud of: Crossing into Kentucky.  We didn't really think we'd make it that far. Crossing the Mississippi River. Hoosier Pass. Seeing the Tetons. Seeing Yellowstone and Old Faithful. Hitting Washington. We've had a few questions about best / worst things on the ride.  Here are some of the more common. Best Riding: Catawba Valley, Virginia. Worst Riding: Highway 12 from Kooskia to Lewiston, ID.  Close second was Yellowstone on National Parks Day. Favorite Part of the Ride: Grand Tetons Best Accomodations: Hotel Udovich Best Camping: Wild Goose Campground, Idaho Worst Accomodations: Pippa Passes Hostel, superdank, aka The Dungeon Most Unusual Accomodations: County Jail Shower in Marshfield, MO. Would we do this again: Probably not the same trip.  However, Mary has been reading about other tours in Adventure Cycling magazine, so we'll probably do another bike trip at some point in time. Lastly, a big thank you to Neil Gunton who created this web site.  It has turned out to be a wonderful way of keeping in touch while on the road.  It wouldn't of been the same trip without it. 
  However, almost every other traveller in India had the same idea, and my travel window was during the Christmas peak season.  Flights were very busy, and the only available flight dates left me a miniscule two weeks to visit.  To further complicate my life, I had to fly out of Chennai (the city formerly known as Madras), and return to Trivandrum.  At least I had a ticket. I wanted to ride around the island, but with only two weeks, this would mean having to ride insane distances each day, and have little time to stop. Something had to be cut out.  Where would be best to visit?  The beaches were in the south, the ancient ruins in the north, and the hill country was in the center.  I decided that I would first go to Colombo and buy a bike, visit the ancient cities in the north, ride to the east coast, and cut back through the hill country.   It was a bit ambitious for two weeks. 
For this trip, I brought the following: Pocket screwdriver/socket setAllen keysBike pumpPatch kit and tire ironsInner tubeCool tool (combination monkey wrench/chainbreak)Duct tape Two water bladders35 l daypack45 l hiking packstrap on cordura carrying casetoo much camera gear (one OM-2 with 28-200 Tamron zoom, one Pentax WR 90,  one tripod and 20 rolls of both exposed and unexposed film I'd been taking with me since Delhi)mosquito netpair of pantspair of shortsan unknown quantity of socks and underwearhiking bootsaqua socks      two t shirtsgortex jacketfleece jacketone good shirtsarongmedical kittoiletriesgroundsheetSri Lanka guidebookReading material (the Baghavad Gita, and the Mahabharata) a bronze statue I'd bought in India
After stepping out of the airport, I caught a taxi-rickshaw to Colombo.  I asked the tout in the rickshaw whether he knew a spot I could buy a bicycle.  Ordinarily, I wouldn't bother asking a tout, but time was short this trip. The tout told me that I was better off going to Negombo, and that he knew a few places.  We turned around, and headed to Negombo to go bike shopping.  There were many stores, with lots of bikes.  Two and a half hours later, I had a somewhat rusty mountain bike, some extra bungee cords, and an outrageous taxi bill.    After settling in, I took the bike out for a test spin.  While riding around Negombo, the rear derailleur popped a screw,  and bits of bike sprayed over the road.  I thought that I was missing a nut, and went off to a bike mechanic to find a suitable replacement.  As it turns out, I didn't and he reassembled the derailleur.   He didn't want any money, but I gave him 20 Rp as he spent some time reassembling it, while being eaten alive by mosquitoes.     That evening I went along the tourist strip to find a good meal.  My guesthouse was very close to the tourist drag, and I thought it would be easy to something to eat.  Earlier in the day,  I had found a place that served chicken biryani and a soft drink for about 100R.  On the strip, most of the restaurants wanted twice as much for just a fish curry.  After much checking, I found a greasy hole in the wall that served up a fish curry and rice, with an egg roti and a bottle of water for 130 r.    This was my first taste of local Sri Lankan food. When it comes to spiciness, Indian food has nothing on Sri Lankan food.  Sri Lankans like their food really hot, and I inhaled water trying to cool down the burning in my mouth.  Despite the fire, the food was delicious, and I thought dreamily of all the meals I would be eating in the coming days.  On the way back to the guesthouse,  I stopped at a small souvenir/gem store to buy some postcards.  The proprietor was very friendly, and both impressed and sympathetic that I planned to ride a bicycle around Sri Lanka.  We talked about Sri Lanka, where to go and where it was safe.  The Tamils and Sri Lankans had been honouring the ceasefire for almost a year, and the entire country was elated that it had lasted that long. According to him, most of the country was safe to travel in, and I should expect little difficulty. 
After a few kilometers, the road connected with the highway, and I once again had to deal with traffic and noise.  The highway was very busy, and almost completed built up with houses and shops on both sides of the road.  Mixed among the various food stores was a small bank with an ATM sign.  I stopped to try out the  ATM.  Half way around the world, in a country just emerging from fifteen years of civil war, and I got money out.  How things have changed! By ten, it was  hot and sunny, but not unbearably so.  It was very humid by that time, and each rest stop turned into a sweat stop.  I was getting hungry, and stopped by the first restaurant that met my criteria.  I have some rules of thumb on finding places to eat.  They seem to work, as I rarely have serious stomach troubles on the road, and generally get reasonably priced meals. 1) restaurant must have patrons.  Locals know where to eat. 2) restaurant dcor must be lacking.  Good food doesn't need good dcor.  Attractive settings tend to drive up prices, without improving the quality of the food. 3) any signs must be in the local lingo.  Tourists drive prices up, and are not good indicators of value in any place I've ever been. The restaurant I found was the typical hole in the wall, or in this case, a shack in the field.  Lacking anything like a sign, or a menu, for that matter, I almost passed it.  However, it was full of truck drivers. Perhaps the best indicator of good food that ever existed!  I ordered a fish curry, and some plain roti.  The proprietor also brought me a plate of assorted stuffed rotis, and I tried one of each.  The food was very good, and just what I needed.  Once again, there was an inferno in my mouth.  Sri Lankans do not hold back on spices! The rest of the day was spent riding along the coast to Puttalam.  Without any bike computer, I had to rely on the somewhat dubious kilometer stones on the side of the highway.  The good thing about riding in Sri Lanka, is that many locals cycle, so the markers show up every kilometer or so.   I arrived in Puttalam around 3 PM.  Not knowing how big the town was, I stopped at the first place I could find, and got a room there.  For 660 R, (about 12 CDN) I got a double room with a fan, private bath, and mosquito net. Surprisingly enough, I wasn't tired at all, and went out to visit the town.    Although Puttalam was a big dot on my map, it was little more than a two bike town.  I hadn't realized I had ridden to the center of town, and when I walked about to see the rest of the town, I discovered I had already seen most of it.  Making life worse was the fact that it was Friday, and a predominantly Muslim area, so almost everything was closed.  Surprisingly enough, the post office was open, and I was able to unburden myself of a few postcards. As there appeared to be no open restaurants in Puttalam, I ate at the hotel restaurant that evening.  Having developed a taste for fish curries, I ordered another.   It was good, but overpriced, given what I had been paying previously.  I think this hotel was used to having more upmarket overseas clientele than me. After dinner, I was too tired to do anything else, and it seemed unlikely there would be much nightlife in a small Muslim town.  It was bedtime, and I fell asleep instantly. 
It was very quiet, with no traffic at that hour, and I heard the cracks of branches breaking  in the jungle.  Was it really true that elephants were irritated by the high frequency squeaks from bikes?  I didn't want to find out the hard way, and pressed on. After twenty kilometers, the road descended and passed by a large lake.  I had hoped otherwise, but it became increasingly evident that the monsoon was not yet over..  Many of the trees were surrounded by water, and the road was disturbingly close to the edge of the lake.   It began to rain at this time.  Just light, fluffy rain, but still rain.   I was getting hungry, and stopped at a small restaurant, which turned out to be a bakery/soft drink shop.  I had a few pieces of passable cake,  and some Sprite.  There was a crate of empty bottles of the local brand of soft drink, and I made a mental note to try it soon.        I headed off, hoping to beat any downpours to Anaradhapura.  About twenty minutes later,   a downpour struck, and I pulled off the road and took shelter under the overhang of a small shop.  Two or three couples with motorbikes did the same, and we waited intently for the rain to slow.  It wasn't a bad downpour, and I was on the road again within 15 minutes.  By this point, I was only about 20 km from Anaradhapura, and wanted to get there as quickly as possible, so I could dry off. The rain struck again about 15 minutes later.  I was coming down hard, and forming small streams on the side of the road.  I tried to continue for a short distance, before realizing the futility of the situation. I could barely see ahead of me.  There was a store ahead with a convenient overhang, and I parked the bike there to wait for a break in the weather.  I bought some cookies from the proprietor, and sat down.  He barely spoke English, but explained that he had sent his son out to fetch his brother, who did.  Although I was thinking of leaving,  I didn't have the heart to, and waited patiently for his brother to arrive.      His brother arrived about fifteen minutes later.  He was a farmer/martial arts instructor who lived a few kilometers away.  As the rain dripped, we talked about Jackie Chan, the state of  the Sri Lankan economy, and most importantly, the weather.  He said the rains were later than usual this year, and I was just unlucky it was so wet.  This wouldn't be the last time I would hear that line. After the rain eased, I explained that I wanted to get to Anaradhapura before the rain started again, and hit the road.  It was only another ten kilometers to the outskirts of Anaradhapura.  The guesthouse I wanted to stay at was on the eastern side of the town, making it necessary to cut through the archeological site.      As I passed the museum and ticket booth, the guards waved me down.  I explained that I would get my ticket after getting a place to stay.  This was good enough, and they allowed me to pass.  The roads were hopelessly twisty, and my map in the guidebook was woefully inadequate.  Somehow, I ended up at the train station, where a taxi driver showed me the route to the guesthouse.  It was a crazy route that took a turnoff onto a dirt road, and  back onto the highway again.  I never would have found it on my own, and wondered how the owner stayed in business.   After I arrived, the owner said that he had no rooms, but if I could wait an hour, one would be available.  Because I wanted to go cycle around anyhow, we packed away my bag, and I rode back to the ancient city ruins.  It was much easier to find the second time around. As it was late in the day, I asked whether it was necessary to buy a ticket.  The guard said that he couldn't sell me a ticket that was good for two days, unless I wanted to buy two one day tickets.  There wasn't more than an hour or two of daylight and that would have made it a very expensive ticket.  It was better to quickly tour the site by bicycle to see what looked interesting, and buy the ticket the next day. The ruins were spread out over about 25 square km.  In theory, you need a valid ticket to go to any of the ruins in the site, but this seemed to be sporadically enforced.  Just in case, I headed to the site of the ancient cities because it was the least likely spot to get checked for a ticket.  The city ruins spread out over a large area, overgrown with trees and moss.  Even though the site has been restored, was really atmospheric.  That late in the day, I was the only person there.  My guesthouse was going to cook my dinner at eight, and it was only five.  I still had some time before the sunset, and rode into the modern part of town to look for some, err , pre dinner.   I stopped at the first promising restaurant, and asked how much it cost for a  5 l jug of water.  They told me it was 160 R, which was a far cry from the 100 R that I had paid in Negombo.  I really hate it when somebody tries to gouge you,  just because you're from out of town.  I took my business elsewhere.  Eventually, I found another restaurant, and ordered some fish curry and a ginger beer.  As usual, the curry was spicy hot and tasty.  I took a swig of the ginger beer and nearly jumped.  Whether it was because my mouth was already burning, or that the ginger beer had so much ginger in it, I don't know.  After my eyes stopped watering, I decided that it tasted pretty good, but I should be a bit more careful in the future. I returned back to my guesthouse, and ate yet another fish curry.  Somehow, this one seemed less spicy.  Was it the preparation, or had some of my tastebuds been burnt out?  I felt exhausted, and headed for my room.  The dinner was sucking all the blood out of my brain and into my stomach.   Once back in the room, I checked how my pack had fared after a day in the rain.  The water had permeated much of my gear, including my guidebook, map and clothing.  I spread everything out to dry, and collapsed into bed. 
  On the way up, I got distracted, and took a side trail.  This led past a small pool, and then to another flight of questionable looking stairs.  These steps led to a higher hill.  Some of the steps were gradually slipping away, others were eroding from hundreds of years of foot traffic.  In the time it took me to climb the steps, some low clouds had crept in and enshrouded the top of the hill.  The view was obscured by the clouds, and the stupa at the top was little more than a pile of neatly arranged bricks. Somewhat disappointed, I descended and headed back to the main complex. As I descended, I could make out the main dagoba through the trees.  The dagoba was impressive in scale, but didn't compare to what I had ridden past in Anaradhapura.  I walked past the main dagoba, and descended into the courtyard.  Here, I got into an argument with the ticket sellers.  They wanted me to buy a ticket for 250 R, and I said it wasn't worth it, and would just leave instead. This wasn't acceptable to them, as I had already seen some of the temple.   After much discussion, we agreed that I could make a donation of 100 R, and see the rest of the ruins. The main complex was also a bit of a let down, as the ruins were devoid of much sculpture or detailing.  I snapped a few photos, and headed back down to my bike.  While riding out of the site, I spotted a small stupa nearby.  Curious, I stopped and took a look.  This stupa had more intricate carvings than anything in Mihintale.  Of course, it was newer, and smaller, but I didn't care.  There was nobody,  Sri Lankans or tourists, at this stupa.  It made the trip out to Mihintale worthwhile.     It was nearing eleven by the time I got back to Anaradhapura.  Strangely enough, (at least for me) I didn't want to spend my time eating in a restaurant,  and bought some sugary snacks instead.  The ruins were huge, with much to see. To sum up, I saw lots of temples, dagobas, and the oldest tree on record in the world.  The monsoon struck while I was trying to see the sights, and I spent a good amount of time hiding under trees.  Overall, Anarudhapura was pretty impressive, and huge in scale.    On the way back to town, I stopped to take a photo of a dagoba.  A man on a bike stopped and offered his services.  This was an immediate clue that I was dealing with a tout.  Rather than go through the charade of making friends and ending up in a souvenir store,  I explained to him that I wasn't lost, did not need to buy anything, that he should not waste his time on me as I had little money, and he wasn't likely to get any of it anyhow.  He didn't seem to believe me, and spent the next two kilometers riding with me, trying his best to sell me some sort of service.  Eventually, I convinced him that I really wasn't interested in any of his services, and he left. By this time, I was almost back in town,  and went to look for some pre dinner.  For a change of pace, I ordered some egg hoppers.  These were bowl shaped pancakes with an egg cooked inside them.  They were very cheap, and filling, and perfect as a pre dinner appetizer.    When I got back to the guesthouse, I checked to see how my drying was coming along.  Before I had left, I hung up some of my wet clothing, and spread out some paper on the bed.  Nothing had really changed.  It was so humid that nothing had  really dried.  The best you could hope for is for things to get less wet. 
It seemed like the rain was slowing down when I set off.  In some places, the monsoon only lasts for an hour, and sometimes less.  I hoped the monsoon in Sri Lanka would be similar.  An hour later, I was still drenched, and the rain showed no signs of letting up.  As a word of warning to other hopeful cyclists, the monsoon in Sri Lanka can last all day.   I stopped at another shop, and proceeded to wring the water out of my gloves, and get a bit less wet. I instantly became the center of attention with all the other Sri Lankans taking shelter.  The proprietor got me some plastic bags, and some helpful Sri Lankans gave me a vague idea of how far it was to get to Habarana.  Unfortunately, their command of English was limited to a few phrases, and my Sinhalese was even more pathetic.  After half and hour, I was as less wet as I was ever going to get, and climbed on the bike again.  It was raining less than it had been before, so I would get wet a little more slowly.  The road was not heavily trafficked, and there would be an occasional stoppage of rain.  It was almost pleasant to ride during the breaks.  About an hour later, I arrived at the crossroads, and turned from the highway onto a much narrower, lumpier road. By this time, the rain had stopped, and I debated whether it would be good to continue or find a place to stay at the crossroads.  It was not even eleven, and soaked as I was, I decided to continue until I found a place.  I would just keep riding until I found a resthouse. I kept riding until I arrived in Habarana an hour later.  There was nothing between the crossroads and Habarana except the forest, and an occasional shop.  At one spot, the road had flooded, but not deeply enough to be impassable. In Habarana, the first hotel I checked at wanted 1500R for a single room, which was about three times more than I was willing to spend.  I crossed the street, and found a more run down guesthouse.  The hired help barely spoke English, but I managed to get a room for 500R, and lunch for an extra 75.  He said they only had fish curry, which was fine by me. The room was a bit grotty, but not bad.  A quick inventory of my stuff made me realize that everything got wet in my daypack.  My camera was  foggy, my flashlight refused to work, and my guidebook was all swollen.  I laid everything out to dry, even though it would not ever get close in the monsoon.  Lunch was calling. After a delicious lunch of fish curry,  I peeked my head outside. It was raining again, and coming down even worse than before.  I wanted to ride to Ritigila to see the ancient ruins there, but the route was supposed to be difficult in wet weather.  It still hadn't stopped after an hour, and I abandoned hope. To pass the time, I took a walk around the town, which took about a minute.  Habarana was small.  Even smaller than Puttalam.  The town extended 200 m in any direction from the crossroads, and then petered out into jungle.  Apart from watching people wait for the bus, there wasn't much in the way of entertainment. I wandered across the street to buy some biscuits and a bottle of ginger beer.  A local started talking to me, and we sat down for a ginger beer.  He was a long distance taxi driver, and was waiting for a fare.  The rain  continued to pour down, and he invited me to play some carom. Carom is a bit like playing pool with checkers.  The carom table is about three quarters meter square with four holes at each corner.  There are eight checkers for each side, and one neutral coloured checker.  Each side (two players per side) takes turns knocking their checkers into the corner holes.  You flick a 'cue' checker and try to knock one of your side's checkers into any of the corner holes.  To win, your side must sink its last checker and the neutral checker consecutively.  There's some more rules, but I wasn't entirely sure what they were.  This might explain all the losses. The rain kept coming down, and I kept losing at carom, but it was a great way to spend the afternoon.  I had to get back across the street for dinner, and was invited back to play carom in the evening.  Dinner at the guesthouse was delicious.  The owner of the guesthouse had returned and taken over from the daytime help.  He cooked a fantastic fish curry, and apologised because the fish wasn't fresh.  I didn't notice.   The owner told me that he had been living in Switzerland for five years as a hotelier.  He had come back to Sri Lanka, and owned this guesthouse and a small plantation in the south.  Most of his clientele were Sri Lankans who had got stuck overnight at the crossroads, and the occasional tourist like myself. He was also hoping that the peace would last, but was worried.  He also said there was nothing worth seeing in Batticaloa and warned me to be wary of wild elephants if I headed north to Trincomalee.   
I left at eightish for Sigiriya, and headed for a back road that was supposed to run by the site.  There wasn't much on the road except jungle and the occasional dirt road.  About ten kilometres in, I saw a dirt road and a sign for Sigiriya.  The dirt road continued straight, and abruptly ended in a river.  I could see the road on the other side of the river, but there was no bridge.  The monsoon was flooding everything.  I would have to ford the river.  Out of nowhere, a man appeared from behind me.  He told me I could get to Sigirya by backtracking and turning at a fork in the dirt road.   Eventually, I found the fork, and rode to the main site entrance, where several guides offered me their services. I politely declined, and entered the site.  Sigirya is a fortress on a sheer sided rock.  It was built as a safe haven by a prince who was paranoid of being attacked by his brother.  Eventually, his brother did attack him, and managed to lure the prince out of the fortress, and defeat the prince on the fields below.  The fortress survived, and was overrun by tourists, several hundred years later.    Sigiriya was impressive when you think of how difficult it must have been to build.  There isn't much more that can be said about the place, other than my camera died there.  I went to take a picture, and the camera refused.  The moisture wreaks havoc on any unsealed electronic items.  Beware! From Sigirya, I rode back to Habarana, had another great meal at the guesthouse, and headed to Ritigila.   It was threatening to rain, and I rode with determination to get to Ritigila.  The monsoon had flooded part of the road, but this was fordable.  The last three kilometers were on a very muddy dirt road, and I wished I had bought a bike with fenders.  The plastic bottle that I crushed  and taped to my rear rack just wasn't cutting it.  I was covered in red brown splatters of mud by the time I arrived at the site.    Ritigila was much quieter than I expected.  There were no tourists there, and the caretakers were making tea behind the office when I arrived.  I hired one of them to take me around the ruins.  Although Ritigila didn't have much to see, it did have lots of atmosphere.  It was a bit like scrabbling through the set of an Indiana Jones movie, with nobody but a guide for company, and thick jungle in every direction.   
I was worried for no reason whatsoever.  By the time I got to the elephant loitering zone, they were long gone.  The checkpoints waved me through, if they were manned at all, and it didn't rain the entire day.  How disappointing.  It's hard to be a pessimist when everything goes well.   Going from Habarana to Trincomalee was more tiring than I expected.  Even though it was cool, and overcast,  I was still exhausted by the time I got to Trinco.  The last 20 km may have done it, as the road was frighteningly bumpy, and hilly as well.  By the time I arrived in Trinco, I was tired of seeing  hills and jungle.    No, I was just plain tired. Being on a budget, I sought out a cheap hotel near the center of Trinco.  Most tourists want to stay near the beach at Nilaveli, but I was planning to put the bike on a bus and needed to be near the train or bus station.  And, with a bike, it is easy enough just to ride to the beach. In Trinco, I chose the cheapest place listed in the Lonely Planet guide, and went there.  Like many places listed in the LP, the owners had figured out that being listed meant there was a virtually endless stream of tourists coming anyhow, and raised its prices accordingly.   It was extortionate.  After asking about other hotels, and getting lost, I ended up near the bus station, and found a very cheap room.  You get what you pay for.  No mosquito nets, shared toilet and shower, and dubious sheets.  But, for 200 R, (about 4 CDN) it was the cheapest place I found in Sri Lanka.  At least the fan worked.   It was less humid, and I was almost able to dry (ok, make less wet) some laundry.    After a short power nap, I walked outside and headed to the park across from the guesthouse.  The dogs that were lazing about near the fence turned out to be spotted deer!  It seems that they are protected by the town and wander freely within the city limits.  Dutch beach was a close by, and a good place to walk amongst fishing boats, small herds of deer, and ubiquitous drink stands.     I got hungry, and headed back into town for fish curryand ginger beer.  Once again, I found a hole in the wall with low prices, low sanitary standards, and no holding back on the chilies.  I ordered a chicken breast, too, just for some variety.    Trincomalee itself was a fishing town turned military base. The military presence was everywhere, and the town was littered with barracks, bases, and checkpoints.  Apart from the occasional ruined building, the town had rebuilt, and there was a beautiful Hindu temple close to the hotel.  Though the atmosphere felt a bit oppressive, I took an instant liking to the town and was very glad to be staying more than one night.
    
Taking no chances, I woke at five, and headed to the bus station.  Like most bus stations in developing countries, it had no signs in any language that I could recognize. Finding the correct berth, if you could call it that, depended mostly on an unrecognizable attendant whose job it was to direct people to the correct bus.  Eventually I found him, and he told me that there would be a bus around six, and it would have a roof rack. There was a minibus getting ready to leave, but it would be impossible to stow the bike inside, or outside.  I would have to wait. I had read that the busses in Sri Lanka were nightmarish, with no storage space, and horrible crowding.  My thoughts started racing towards paranoia.  Not an uncommon trend, when you consider sitting in the dark without a clue where the bus is, and how you will load a bicycle and luggage on to it.  I started asking drivers of the busses with racks whether there were heading towards Polonnaruwa.  Nobody was.  I would have to take my chances with the yet unseen bus. Eventually, a rickety old bus pulled up.  It looked like it had been through a few wars, (and probably had) and was woefully lacking anything like a roof rack.  This would be my ride to Polonnaruwa.   I found the conductor, and explained to him that I had a bike with me.  He told me not to worry, and asked me to bring the bike inside the bus.  To my surprise, we got it inside, where we strapped it to a support pole on the aisle.   At least I was on, with my bike and gear.  But where would the crowds of people sit? My bike was blocking access to two rows of seats. Completely unexpected, the bus left.  I was expecting it to stay in the station until the bus was packed full, but this one left with half the seats empty.  I was now on my way to Polonnaruwa, with my bike inside, in a bus that was half empty.  And then the rain started.  Sometimes everything works.   While on the bus, I talked with the man sitting in the seat ahead of me.  He was heading to Batticaloa with his new wife.  They had been married for just a month, and he was already having second thoughts.  As it so often does, we talked about the political climate in Sri Lanka.  He was also hopeful of the peace process, but seemed to be hedging his bets when he asked me if I could sponsor him in Canada. We arrived in Polonnaruwa around mid morning and I was dropped off in front of the ancient ruins.  Instead of finding a guesthouse, the guesthouse owner found me.  He happened to be riding by when he saw me strapping gear to my bike.  I followed him along a dirt road out to the edge of town.  The guesthouse was close to the rice paddies, and peacefully far from the main road.  With attached bathrooms and mosquito nets in each room, it seemed like a palace compared to the place I had stayed in the previous night.   As I was running low on time,  I got settled quickly, and rode back to the ruins.  I got caught in a downpour, and waited under the eave of a building until it finished.  There was a really informative museum nearby, which was invaluable for introducing the history of the site.   Because these ruins were only 800 years old, they had much more detail work left.  I spent the rest of the day alternating between visiting ancient temples and hiding from the rain with drink sellers and site guards.  One of the guards tried to marry me to his sister and one of the drink touts offered to buy my bike.  Despite the bad weather, I thought these were the most impressive ruins in Sri Lanka.    It was nearing the end of the day.  I had just seen a very impressive set of huge Buddha images carved out solid stone, and was ready to head home.  I got on the bike, and felt the wheel lock just as I started pedalling.  The chain had snapped, and snagged on the derailleur.  The derailleur twisted itself around the spokes, was hopelessly bent out of shape.  This didn't look good.  A passing guard said the same thing, and directed me to a bike mechanic 2 km away.  He said I should hurry to get there, as it would be closing soon.      I rushed as best as I could with an unridable bike, and found the mechanic shop in the middle of nowhere.   They took one look and started working.  First, they bent the derailleur back into shape, and then pounded the chain links together (no chain break at this shop!)  with an metal plate and a hammer and pin.  All things considered, they did a great job, and charged me only 30 R. It was a tense ride back into town.  Would the chain snap again or was it the derailleur getting hooked on the spokes?   I rode slowly and carefully.  After a few kilometres, nothing had snapped or snagged, and I felt a sense of relief, at least for a little while.     After stopping for a brief pre-dinner snack of egg hoppers, I arrived back at the guesthouse.  His wife served up a delicious, yet slightly overpriced vegetarian curry.  There was a full house that night, with a couple of Brits, and three Germans.   I was planning to ride towards Batticaloa, and then cut down towards the hill country.  The owner said this wasn't a good idea, as the roads were not only terrible, but flooded as well.  The late monsoon had flooded the road to the east, and it was questionable whether it would be passable. Change of plans.  I decided to head towards Dambulla in the west, and possibly Kandy, or return early to Negombo.  The breakdown shook my confidence, and I wasn't sure if the bike would last all the way back.  I felt it was better to get closer to civilization, rather than head further into the countryside.  With only a few days left, I didn't want to miss my plane flight to India.  If I missed the flight, I'd miss my train, which would mean missing my flight to Dubai, and my flight to London Well you get the idea.  It would be bad to miss the first leg. 
This part of the country didn't really differ much from the rest of the country.  Lots of farms, low hills, and lakes.  There wasn't much traffic and the clouds kept the temperature cool enough to ride comfortably.  After an hour I felt better about the bike, and the rain hadn't yet arrived. About 20 km from Polonnaruwa, the road cut through a national park   The tended crops transformed to thick jungle, and I started thinking about wild elephants again.  Despite this, I felt an irresistable urge to sneak into the jungle, not only because I could get in the park for free, but also because I felt the call of nature.   I spotted a small trail off the main road, parked the bike, and walked the path to look for a convenient tree.  While standing about, and enjoying the vastness of the jungle, I heard the distinct sound of an automatic weapon going off in the distance.  This was followed by more gunfire, and small explosions. Was there a firefight going on?  It didn't sound like a training exercise, and I wasn't willing to find out if the ceasefire just got broken.  I could walk further into the jungle and find out, or I could just get on the bike and pretend I never heard it.  I remembered that expression about cats and curiosity,  and how it could apply to Curts as well.  Fear won out over stupid curiosity, and I hopped back on the bike.  After a few more kilometers, I was out of the national park.  It wasn't far to the crossroads.  I stopped quickly for some savoury, doughnut-like snacks (whose name I never did learn) and a few bottles of ginger beer.  And then, it was downhill.  The Brits were right!  It was almost effortless to pedal, and the sun came out too.  I was feeling great, and arrived in Dambulla at noon.    I went to a place that was recommended by the guesthouse owner in Polonnaruwa.  After seeing the room, I realized that the two must have been friends.  It was grotty and dark, and badly in need of renovations.  However, the price was right, and they had a restaurant that was recommended by the Lonely Planet.  It was only noon and I was getting hungry.  I ordered some lunch, and waited eagerly. I was clearly in a place that catered to tourists.  There were several small groups of tourists in the restaurant, all of whom were travelling on a higher budget than me.  They were clean, dressed in summer outfits, and sunburnt.    The meal itself was a huge disappointment.  It looked good, but that was about the best that could be said.  As it was spiced for tourists, I found it very bland, and had to ask the waiter for chili powder, or anything that would give it a bit of fire.  I had originally used the knife and fork provided, but went back to eating with my right hand because Sri Lankan food really does taste better when eaten that way.  There is a set of ancient Buddhist caves in Dambulla.  Although I was getting very tired of seeing ancient carved stones, I had nothing better to do that afternoon.  It was a fair hike up a few hundred steps to the caves, and hot in the in afternoon sun.  It was the weekend, and the staircase was crowded with Sri Lankans.  Because they were Sri Lankan tourists, it made the place feel less like a tourist trap, and more like a cultural event.   Inside the caves, there were several statues of Buddha, and countless painted images.  If you are not into Buddhist art, each Buddha looks very similar, and it can be hard to appreciate.  What made the caves special were the Sri Lankans that came.  It was a religious experience for many of them, and I felt like a bit of an intruder.  The sound of dripping water in an otherwise dark, silent cave full of praying people lent an eerie and  otherworldly atmosphere to the experience.     I went back to the guesthouse, and started writing some postcards when the power went out.  The owner said it was a common occurrence, and would be back on within the hour.  It flicked on again in fifteen minutes, lasted all of five minutes, and shut off again.  It came back on, and an hour later, shut off.  I started feeling tired and feverish, and went to my room to rest. By dinner time, I was not feeling any better, and could barely eat.  There was not supposed to be any malaria in Sri Lanka, but I started worrying.  Had I been bitten somewhere in India?  Was it dengue fever or something worse?  Or was it because I was just tired? 
The countryside started getting hillier, and it was still sunny.  The monsoon had finally left!  I might actually be able to dry something!  I had to stop frequently, for rest, ginger snaps, and the occasional king coconut but was really enjoying riding in the sunshine.  The last ten kilometres were along a terribly maintained, and hilly road, but I didn't care.    At the edge of Kegalle, I found a hotel that looked promising.  I asked the price, and the girl said it would be 1275 R for a single.  The manager overheard our conversation, and offered to discount a single room to 600 R, which was more of what I had in mind.  The room was clearly a step above what I was used to, as it had natural, and was really clean and quiet.  More than I wanted to spend, but more quality than I was expecting.  A good trade off. There was nothing to see worth mentioning in Kegalle.  Little more than an oversized truck stop, it didn't have much to entertain the average tourist, or local for that matter.  However, it was the closest town (if you could call it that) to the Pinewawa elephant orphanage.   The orphanage takes orphaned elephants and trains them for useful work.  A bit like a delinquency school for pachyderms.  I rode the 10 km to the orphanage, to arrive at what may have been the greatest concentration of tourist traps in Sri Lanka.  The road to hell is paved with good intentions, and the road to Pinewawa is paved with spice plantations, cold drink shops, and guesthouses.  I suddenly understood why my hotel was so quick to discount my room.  There was no question of missing the orphanage, as all the drink stops and kitsch shops seemed to congregate into a seething mass.   The orphanage was capitalizing on its fame, and souvenirs of just about anything elephant related could be purchased.  It was even possible to buy paper made from the dung of elephants.    This was my kind of souvenir.  I would have bought some except that it was extortionately priced by just about anyone's standards, good taste not withstanding. I bought a tourist ticket (marked up a mere 1000% of what the locals pay) and ran the gauntlet of restaurants and souvenir stores that sprouted from either side of the river road.  By the time I had arrived, the elephants were getting ready to be washed in the river, and a crowd of westerners and Sri Lankans had gathered at the numerous river view restaurants.     While seeing an elephant wasn't high on my list of priorities,  and seeing a bunch of them was only slightly higher,  it was a really enjoyable experience watching the elephants loll about and get washed by the mahouts.  They really are fascinating creatures to watch, as they walk funny and just sway about. With the afternoon spent,  I headed back to Kegalle, ate loads of ice cream, hoppers, and whatever else I could find, and turned in early.  With such a good room, it seemed like a waste not to spend any time in it. 
The congestion had gotten worse in the 45 minutes that it took me to eat breakfast.  After waiting for one of the infrequent breaks in traffic, I headed down the highway, and the traffic mysteriously trickled to nothing a few minutes later.  The sun was shining, it was comfortably cool, and I was heading downhill. Three kilometres later, the enjoyable part of the ride came to an end.  My chain was starting to pop out.  The fix done in Polonnaruwa was wearing out. I tightened up the chain link, and started riding again, only to have it loosen up a few hundred metres later.  I needed to replace the links, or the chain.  No stores had yet opened, and there wasn't a mechanic in sight. I had to pedal slowly, and push the bike when I hit an uphill section.  Sooner or later, I would pass an open store, or find a mechanic.  I found a mechanic first, but he knew little about mountain bikes and cracked the link trying to pound it into place.  It was better to have  a short working chain, than a long broken one, so I removed the link and continued on.  I found a bike store  twenty kilometres later, and got a Taiwanese chain.  The mechanic was too busy at that moment, so I did it myself, and drew a small crowd of spectators.   With only thirty km to go, the traffic got considerably worse, and I had three close calls.  Sri Lankans drive like maniacs, and I was very happy to be at the end of the trip.  The morning meal was weighing me down, and I was fatigued, hot, and thirsty.  Fortunately, there were plenty of people selling coconuts, and I made a small contribution to the livelihoods of several farmer in Sri Lanka.   The tourist ghetto was a bit north of Negombo, so I would need to cut through the centre of town. I rode through the core of Negombo, and I found rambutan!  These are red hairy fruits that are delicious.  The twenty that I bought didn't even last one day.   
  Colombo was a noisy, congested place. Downtown, there were plenty of old colonial style buildings, and dumpy, atmospheric markets.   I walked from the bus station to Galle road, passing several military checkpoints, touts, and traffic jams.  It was good to have nowhere I had to be, and nothing I had to see.      On the promenade at Galle road, it got really hot, I felt feverish again, and had a splitting headache.  I took a nap on the promenade, and spent the rest of the afternoon in a somewhat fruitless attempt to find more souvenirs.    I caught the bus to Negombo, and headed out for something to eat.  On the way, I stopped at the souvenir/gem store owner's shop to let him know I was back, and still alive. We chatted about my trip, and the future of Sri Lanka.  I told him I was selling the bike, and he said that he would buy it if I couldn't find anyone else to sell it to.  At least now, I had a backup plan. 
   My last day.  I had nothing to do except sell the bike, and find some rambutan.  In the morning, I headed to the old market in Negombo.  It was bustling, but I didn't find any rambutan.  There was plenty of fresh fish, but it would be difficult to get them through customs.  I circled the market a few times and then tried at the street corner where the seller was the day before.  No luck.  Whoever was selling rambutan was keeping it a secret.  I headed back to the market and was ready to give up, when one of the merchants found an old woman selling rambutan.  They were tiny, and overripe, but I didn't care.    Somebody was supposed to come at noon to look at the bike, but he didn't show up.  However, the guesthouse owner said he knew somebody who was interested.  He said I could take the bike for the afternoon, and sell it in the evening. Sensing a sting, I told him that I wanted to sell it this afternoon.  He called over his neighbour, who started trying to bargain me down.  I didn't tell them that I had an ace in the hole.  The neighbour figured that he had me, and wouldn't give me a decent price.  He thought he could get it for less, so I called his bluff, and packed the bike and left.   The gem store man and I swapped the bike for souvenirs.  He had made the offer earlier, and probably had a good idea of what might happen.  (To any of my friends who weren't happy with their Sri Lankan gift, you could have gotten a rusty shifter  or cog set!)  Because treated me fairly, I gave him my screwdriver set as well.  I was livid with the guesthouse neighbours, and would have rather given my bike a burial at sea than sell it to them.  When I returned, they seemed genuinely surprised when I said I sold the bike, and still tried to offer me an outrageously low price, despite the fact that I was walking to the guesthouse.  The bike was gone, and now I had a bag of souvenirs to take home. 
This line was to pay the airport departure tax.  Colombo was one of the last spots on the planet that collects the tax at the airport, and only accepted Sri Lankan rupee.  Be warned, should you come this way.  One unsuspecting traveller in the line did not know this, and had to go back outside the security check to get some local currency.  I wonder if he made his flight. Finally, I made it to the cashier, and paid my tax.  Then it was time to stand in the passport control line, followed by the baggage check line, followed by the final passport stamp checkline.  It had taken nearly two hours to jump through all the hoops.  I sat down, exhausted, and looked in my bag for a snack. As I cracked open the last of my rambutan, I heard a voice ask me what I was eating.  I looked up, and saw Jeff, a fellow Canadian.  He had been part of the group of Canadians that I spent Christmas day with back in India.  He was a friend of a friend of a friend (how's that for a tenuous relationship)  and just transiting through Sri Lanka on his way to Bangkok.  He had just arrived, and had a flight out in fifteen minutes.  It is indeed a small world.       After saying goodbye, I went catch my own flight.  Once again, it was time to wait in line.  This time, I had to get my luggage checked, then get my passport and ticket checked and then get my luggage checked again.  After so much security, it seemed almost anticlimactic to just step on the plane.   The flight was uneventful, and short.  Once in Trivandrum, I caught a cab to the train station, and checked for my train.  It was leaving the next day, but I wanted to be sure where to catch it. The schedules posted made no mention of the train number, so I checked with the information office.  The man told me the train left from Ernakalum, 200 km north.  I purchased a ticket north, and hopped the first train I could.  But that's another story. 
Cycling is very common, so it is easy to find bike shops and mechanics throughout the country.  However, having cyclists on the road doesn't necessarily mean that the drivers are any better.  The roads within a 30 km radius of Colombo (the main city) are crowded and very hazardous, as drivers will expect a cyclist (or any vehicle smaller than them) to get off the road if they want to pass. There's lots to see and do in Sri Lanka, and even people not associated with the tourist industry are warm and friendly.  And the food...fiery hot, but really tasty.  I'd go again just for that. 
   We have done several small tours in the past and have always looked forward to having the time to ride across our country.  One day Sandy said, "When are we going to do that ride we've been talking about?"  There's no time like the present, so.... now we have to get in shape!!! We are experienced cycle tourists, and we have most of the equipment we will need but some of it is old and in need of repair or updating. The first thing we needed to do was get a bike that we could ship easily. The Bicycle Outfitter in Los Altos was where we went to test ride new tandems. Our new bike is a Santana Arriva set up with S&S coupling, and all the necessary accessories for long distance loaded touring.    On our last trip we borrowed a friends trailer and really felt that having some of the weight on the trailer made for a much more enjoyable ride. When discussing the difficulty getting a trailer that would fit the extra wide dropouts on our new bike, an acquaintance (who happens to work at Yakima) suggested that we might be able to test out one of their prototypes with the wide spacing. We are looking forward to its completion so we can start getting used to hauling it around on our training rides. Planning and organizing has been great fun.  Hope the trip is equally fun!!!   
   We just picked up our new Yakima Big Tow trailer, and today's inaugural ride went perfectly. The people at Yakima had to develop a new yoke to fit the wider 160mm dropouts on our Santana tandem. We really like the way the trailer looks and the handling behind the bike was as if it wasn't there, but there must have been a flat on the bike 'cause we went a bit slower! All of the gear we want to stow in the trailer fit in the bag with room to spare. Riding around with a trailer sure gets more attention. We feel kind of silly when we have to say we've only gone 20 miles and we are back home after a training ride. People expect us to be out on a big trek and we will be home in our own bed tonight.    Show links to this Hide links to this     
   Show links to this Hide links to this      Our route today was relatively flat but we still spent a lot of time in our small chainring. Having the touring mindset helps, slow and steady all the way. When we got to Arcata there were so many people in town for Humboldt state's graduation that we got even more attention than our first ride with the trailer last week. It really is fun having so many people ask about the bike, trailer and all the gear. The children especially love Tigger our leader   
  

After getting to the island we still had 20 miles to reach the campground which made for a bit of a long first day.   
In the morning we had a quick ride north to the ferry terminal so Dick and Heidi could head home, and we continued north toward Anacortes. We enjoyed the islands scenery but the hills were a bit of a challenge. Training, what training? In Oak Harbor we found a bike shop and got info about routes and a new chain to replace the one John had fouled up installing in Seattle. Unfortunately the county maps we bought didn't have the correct names of the roads. Alas, the great directions about missing a wicked hill did us no good. More character building!! Deception pass Campground.......NOISY NAVY FLY BOYS!!!!!! otherwise not so bad.   
It is nice to be off the Island, much flatter terrain this morning. Threatening weather but dry. We stopped in Burlington at the C of C visitors center to find out about laundry and library. While inside the sky opened up and a deluge came down..while we were inside. There was no internet access in town so Karr at the C of C let us use her computer to E-mail our moms. With the threatening weather we decided to stop at the KOA outside of town and get a cabin, do laundry, and soak in the hot tub. A great luxurious night all together.   

  
As we approached the top of Rainy Pass, it started to lightly snow, continuing until we started to descend after Washington Pass. We had never really ridden in snow before so that was fun...but also cold on the descent. We put on lots of layers of clothing for the descent; some other cyclists didn't have enough and could barely control their bikes on the downhill. We stopped at Mazama for some warm coffee, then on to Winthrop for a well deserved day off.   
We visited for a while with a group of recumbent riders who rode over the passes one day, rested a day, then were planning to ride back over again, fully loaded with gear, as a training ride for their upcoming tour.  It was fun chatting with other cyclists.   
The afternoon was hot but we had an incredible tailwind until we stopped. We really made up some miles quickly. Our tent held up to the wind but we have never camped in stronger winds anywhere before. We met fellow EB(eastbound)tourists, Marge and Terry, today at the store in Riverside. They pushed on a bit further tonight to get closer to tomorrows climb.   
As we approached the top we kept hearing thunder and the sky was getting very threatening behind us. We got over the top before the rain started and pulled into a lumber yard and waited out the rain and hail under the plywood shed. We found a library in town and then moseyed out to the fairgrounds for a hot shower and a great nights sleep. We saw Marge and Terry today a couple of times and they camped at the fairgrounds too.   
As we reached the top it started to sprinkle. We hurried down and stayed ahead of it all the way to Colville. We dodged the rain yet one more time. Camped at the fairgrounds in Colville. Very interesting with all the preparations for the upcoming rodeo. The whole campground was full of horse trailers and kids, big and small, on horses.   
We still had plenty of climbing today but nothing like the past few days. We came out at the Pend Oreille River, which was a bit confusing because it runs north. We followed the river south and found a great campground with laundry, showers and soft grass for our tent. Everything we needed.   
We got into Newport about noon and stocked up for the rest of the day at our ever handy Safeway. As we headed out of town we started noticing the Idaho plates and helmetless motorcycle riders. How did we get into Idaho without knowing? How hot is it??!! We pushed through the heat and hills to Mosquito, we mean Round Lake State Park. It was nice except for, did we mention the mosquitoes?   
We rode down a side street and encountered another cycle tourist.  It turned out to be Dave Bowen, who we met through this website prior to our trip.  It was nice to finally meet him face to face. What a coincidence! We stayed at a great (and inexpensive)motel called the K2 Inn right downtown.  We ran into Marge & Terry again, staying at the same place.  We spent the day doing errands, shopping, eating ice cream, and generally goofing off.  It was wonderful to sleep on a REAL BED!   
Oh no! Glacier is closed?! At the campground we heard that Logan Pass in Glacier Nat'l Park will probably be closed until July.  No "Going To The Sun Highway" for us this time. They are having problems with heavy snowfall and avalanches. Maybe next year.... hey, Loren & Greg...we need to talk about next summer!   
   Highway 200 was nice and fairly flat, with light traffic.  It followed the Clark Fork through a beautiful valley bordered by fantastic sheer rock mountains, some still sprinkled with snow. Hooray! We finally found a place that would let us upload our pictures to this website.  Thank you, thank you, Crazy Ernie!
Luxurious night with king size bed, hot spa, tavern and a restaurant.  What more could a touring cyclist want?   
   In Missoula we stopped at the Smoke Jumpers Center and took a tour of their facility.  That made up for missing the one that was closed in Winthrop.
  There were all the services that we could have desired in Missoula. Shoe repair,maps,restaurants, and we even got to go to the REI store and replace a few needed items. We had dinner with Jackie and Dave, they are heading east tomorrow and we will be going to the south before heading east.
  We stopped to take a tour of the Marcus Daly mansion outside Hamilton. Daly was one of the Copper barons and the history was very interesting. Even with the time spent touring we got to camp fairly early and dodged the afternoon thunderstorms again.   
We started dinner early, when the thunder started up. We ended up eating in the tent and we let the rain rinse out the dishes. The hot tub helped ease our muscles and kept us out of the rain too. We are really beginning to love the good old KOA's   
We were a little disappointed at the descent.  We expected a screaming downhill, but it turned out to be a gradual grade and we had to pedal!! About halfway down we stopped at the Big Hole Battlefield Monument where the army engaged the Nez Perce Indians.  The most memorable thing for us was the most tenacious, vicious mosquitoes we ever met. We couldn't take any more stops because the little buggers were everywhere!  They could keep up with us at 12 MPH so we had to go faster to avoid them.  That wasn't always easy on the uphills! Jackson is a tiny town with basically 2 taverns and a hot springs lodge. Another night of soaking in wonderfully hot water!    Show links to this Hide links to this     
   We got a nice descent this time, into Dillon.  This is the first real city we've come to since leaving Missoula, therefore we're using the library's computers, went to the supermarket, and did laundry too.  We went to 7 Peaks internet service on South Montana St to upload our pictures.  It's difficult to find a place that will let us upload our images.   
  
  
It was a nice ride into West Yellowstone skirting a lake with rolling terrain and beautiful scenery.  After taking care of some errands we rode 14 more miles into Yellowstone Park to Madison Junction where we camped.  The roads had good shoulders, traffic was moderate, and we saw a bull moose and a bald eagle nest with a fledgling that was testing his wings before his first flight. Of course, it wouldn't be a national park without RVs and crowds.     
The rest of the day was spent climbing toward our next campground, crossing the Continental Divide twice.  It was slow going, with lots of traffic and barely adequate shoulders. We're starting to see more cycle tourists both east and west bound.   
        
  
  
  
Cody was in the midst of their 4th of July and rodeo celebrations. It was a bit hectic and crowded but everyone was in good spirits and having fun. We missed the parade but we had to work to miss what the horses left on the roads.  We had to hurry out to the campground when the weather started to threaten rain. It never did do anything but sprinkle and we got set up with no problems. We were in the most expensive KOA we've ever seen and also the most crowded, but at least there was room for us and we got free pancakes the next morning.   
We were riding by 7:30 but it was already warm. By 9:00 it was hot by our standards. The most interesting thing about the terrain was the road junk. We added 4 license plates to our collection, pretty good for one 40 mile stretch. The scenery was just rolling hills with nothing but sage brush growing anywhere. Every once in a while there would be an irrigated area but they were few and widely spaced. The Root Beer floats at Greybull were very welcome. Even at noon it was very hot and we spent the rest of the day just trying to stay out of the sun and stay cool. It was too hot to cook so we found a nice air conditioned restaurant to eat at and tried to get to bed early so we could get a very early start for tomorrow's climb. The local fireworks display was visible right from the window of our tent, very pretty but not conducive to a good night's rest.   
The Shell Canyon is very beautiful where the river cut into the mountains. The colors and rock formations were incredible. The biggest problem was that we had to climb up the canyon and it was relentless. Never a break, not even a lessening of the grade, just a steady, sun drenched, 18 miles at 6%, with 6000 feet of elevation gain. We took numerous breaks to rest all the various parts of our bodies that were rebelling. We did it though and are we glad that is over. It was by far the most difficult day of our trip if not our entire cycling lives.     
We went through Ranchester to Sheridan where we spent the evening with Bob,Judy and their family who we met through our tandem club.  We had a fabulous dinner and a relaxing and enjoyable evening getting to know them all better.   
In Buffalo we got a motel room, found an all-night diner so we could get an early start on tomorrow's long hot day.  No cooking breakfast, no packing up camp, just riding at first light. In the middle of the night we were awakened by the biggest and loudest thunderstorm we've ever seen.  It was exhilarating, frightening, and beautiful and it made us very glad we weren't in our tent.   
  
After leaving Moorcroft, we turned north into a moderate wind and started climbing through rolling hills toward Devils Tower.  The wind actually made the heat bearable.  We got glimpses of the Tower from about 12 miles out, and we enjoyed the beautiful red rock canyon as we continued to climb. We found a shady campsite at the KOA which was at the base of Devil's Tower.  Every night at 9:00 (too late for us) they show "Close Encounters of the 3rd Kind" on an outdoor screen.  Our campsite just happened to be the closest one to the movie... thank goodness for earplugs!   
Spearfish is the nicest city we've been in for quite a while.  John made the comment,"This is my favorite city in all of Wyoming!"  Uh, John, this is South Dakota!    Next to the campground was a fantastic Mexican restaurant (The Guadalajara), and the friendly women at the visitor center directed us to their very modern library, a bike shop, and a barbershop.  Everyone was extremely nice and very helpful.
   Deadwood is really into their history (Calamity Jane, Wild Bill Hickok, etc.) but it looked like a tacky version of "Old West Las Vegas" to us.  Upstairs in Miss Kitty's casino we found a Chinese restaurant.  In view of the slot machines, we ate our Kung Pao chicken while listening to the "Lovin Spoonful" and various other oldies.  Weird!!
   It was fun riding over the trestles and we loved those nice cool tunnels!       The total trail is 109 miles and we rode about half of it to Hill City.
   It was too hot, even in an air conditioned car to fully appreciate the natural beauty of it.  It was embarrassing to be so wiped out by the heat that we couldn't really experience it.    Back to the Black Hills where it was (somewhat) cooler.  Mount Rushmore was very interesting and we enjoyed learning about why and how the monument was constructed.    On to Crazy Horse.  Another incredible monument being carved into a mountain.  The story was interesting, but we were even more burned out than we were in the Badlands. We got back into Hill City in time to upload our pictures for the whole last week (it's often difficult to find a place to upload our pictures- libraries usually just let us do text). We didn't ride a single mile, but we were exhausted at the end of the day.
  
  passing the 2000 mile mark in the process.  The day got hotter--another 110 degree day. We killed time in the bizarre coolness of the Wall Drug tourist shops.  What a zoo!  And SO tacky!   
We arrived in Midland by 10:30 and got a tiny motel room to wait out the heat.  We couldn't bear the thought of camping in this heat.  When John loses his appetite, you know things are getting bad!  Another day of 110 degrees!  And no relief in sight!   
  
The weather is cooler today and we are hoping for a bit of a reprieve when we continue tomorrow.   
  Today's ride was much cooler, with an overcast sky all day. The headwind helped keep us cool too, even though it was a bit humid. Instead of grazing cattle, we saw fields of corn and sunflowers and the terrain was pretty flat.  In Gettysburg we were told it's OK to camp at the city park, which also has showers.  Everyone here is super friendly and helpful...and the library is air conditioned.      We had fun tonight watching the local boys play a double header against the team from Pierre. Not the greatest quality baseball but something to do as we waited for the temps and sun to go down. We're still heading north and east, and will probably leave South Dakota in 4 days or so.
We discovered a crack in our rear rim as we came into town and the ladies at the drug store helped us find a bike shop in the next town, Aberdeen. They didn't have 48 hole rim so we contacted Jack Goertz at Tandems Limited in Alabama and he is overnighting a rim to the shop. We think we can ride on the rim so we will head to Aberdeen tomorrow. As it got later in the evening we had to get into our hot tent and try to sleep. Which is worse, heat because the screens are up or bugs because you take down the screens to try to get the nonexistent airflow??!!  We had been told that there was a cold front coming to help ease the temps some. We weren't told it would hit at 2:30 AM and have 60 mph winds. The tent held together fine after we actually put the tent stakes into the ground properly, in the dark, wind and rain. It was a bit scary for us coastal residents, unused to intense thunder storms. At least the lightning wasn't real close and we were mostly worried about the wind. Needless to say sleep was a hard to find comfort during a night of heat, bugs, wind, rain, and thunder.   
Trying to straighten out the crack in the rim seems to have exacerbated the problem and we now have piece of the rim in our tool bag!!! After pushing the bike to the cafe and having a great breakfast, we put out the sign that the cook helped us make and had a ride in about 5 minutes.    Tom was heading to Aberdeen to get building supplies in his truck and helped load our wounded bike into his truck for the 1 hour drive. Thanks Tom... again we find that the people in our wonderful country are friendly, and caring.    After getting to Aberdeen a local resident pointed us to a great bargain motel and we have settled down to await our rim from Alabama (Tuesday). More Tour de France on TV, go Lance go.
Although we didn't ride, we walked about 6 miles in town.  After doing errands, we walked the couple miles to the mall, picked up a few item we needed, and watched a movie.  "Men in Black 2" is pretty silly, but it was a good way to pass some time.

Now in North Dakota, we have gone through 6 states and 3 time zones.   
We passed more corn fields and sunflower fields and had an uneventful ride to Enderlin.  Everywhere we stopped we were approached by people asking about our trip.  At one point we thought we may never be able to leave the grocery store's parking lot! While in the library in Enderlin, we were even interviewed and photographed by the local newspaper, "The Enderlin Independent". The tandem & trailer attract a lot of interest and it's fun sharing our trip with everyone.   
  We rode past more corn and sunflower fields, passing Enderlin's huge sunflower processing plant (the world's largest according to locals).  Along the way we stopped for cold sodas ("pop" out here) at the Knickerbocker Liquor Locker (we love that name!).  The young bartender gave us free pop and good advice about finding our way around Fargo (another city with a lot of road construction). We crossed the Red River into Moorhead, Minnesota, where we found a campground with showers and laundry facilities.
  The view from the cabin was fabulous, with the sun setting into Ice Cracking Lake.   
We headed to Lake Itasca which is the headwaters of the Mississippi River.  We were 7 miles away when we encountered a road closure with construction (we can't blame the ACA for this one!).  There had been no signs warning us about a closure or detour.  Now what?  It was a 20 mile detour so we decided to ride through the 5 miles of the construction zone.  Being Sunday, there was no work being done.  At first the road looked impassable.  We could hardly push the bike through the thick soft sand.  It seemed impossible.  We flagged down a passing car and asked about the road.  The driver said he would unload his car at his home and come back to give us a ride.  He came back and reported that the really bad part was minimal and that most of it was hard packed dirt.  We decided to go for it.  We walked and pushed some, rode some, slid and swerved some, and finally made it to the Mississippi River (which was the size of the creek in our back yard!).    We cruised into Laporte and asked about camping.  The woman in the store said we could pitch our tent behind her laundromat which had bathrooms, sink, tables, benches, and laundry facilities--everything we needed.
  We checked out the national forest campground at Mable Lake, but since it only had pit toilets, no showers, and lots of mosquitoes and poison ivy, we rode on to Remer.  There we found a nice campsite in town.  This town, like most small towns that we've passed through in Minnesota, had no library, but a man we met in a cafe offered the use of his computer.
The Floodwood campground was on the Savannah River, so we got a motel room,  no mosquitoes there.   
Back on the road we had an uneventful ride into Duluth.  We stopped at the library for information.  Before we even entered, we had half a dozen people come up and offer information and help.  It's surprising that the big city seems more friendly than the small towns in Minnesota.   
  When we arrived at the waterfront the 2 masted tall ship Niagara was just coming into the harbor. It was very festive with so many people watching and the ship firing it's cannnons. We had perfect weather to wander around and enjoy the old town and the lakewalk. They have a beautiful harbor and there were tons of people just like us wandering around and enjoying the sights.  We have been looking forward to seeing Duluth ever since we started planning our trip. Duluth came up in many, many different contexts as we talked to people about our plans and it was always portrayed in a very positive manner. We have found it has lived up to our expectations so far.
We had a nice time, but overall we wished we had been on the bicycle heading east.   
Once in Superior we found the paved Osaugie Trail which ran east through town.  When it ended we picked up the Tri Counties Corridor, a packed gravel trail that could take us all the way to Ashland.  The surface was good, but we couldn't make as good time as on the highway, so we rode on Hwy 2, using the trail only to bypass the 8 miles of construction. We spent about an hour under a picnic shelter in Brule while a thunder storm passed through.  we met Jim from Victoria, BC and leapfrogged with him all day along the highway. We were told of a nice campground on the shore of Lake Superior, but when we got there, guess what?! NO TENTS ALLOWED!!!  We had to backtrack through town to find another spot to camp and we shared a site with Jim.  Today was the first day we actually had to ride, make camp, or cook in the rain, and we had to do all three.  After 2 months and 2800 miles we had a little light rain on our parade.   
In Ironwood we met Sandy and Arlyn who hosted us.  We had a nice time getting to know them and talking about bikes and touring.  The comfort of their home was wonderful, especially after our previous wet night in the city park.   
Midway through the day we broke a rear spoke.  The combination of the rough roads and the inexpertly rebuilt wheel took its toll.  We knew the wheel was not perfect, but we had hoped it was good enough.  Not quite.  After some minimal roadside adjustments we rode on. When we arrived at Boyd's, he was as happy to see us as we were to see him.  He thought he may have to rescue us.  With his help, we repaired the wheel then spent an enjoyable evening getting to know him.  Needless to say, these two cyclists slept very well.   
  It seemed like a short day today, only riding 50 miles.  We rode leisurely along our old friend, Bumpy Hwy 2 through Crystal Falls and Florence.     We celebrated our 3000th mile with rootbeer floats and had a relaxing evening working out the kinks from yesterday's ride. 
The highlight of the day was crossing into the eastern time zone.  We pulled into Pioneer Trail Campground on the Escanaba River and found a flat, quiet, bugless site to pitch our tent.  This is one of the best campsites we've had in months.   
  We rolled on another 20 miles and stopped just short of Blaney Park for the night.   
  
  The island was pretty, with interesting historical and geological features, but if you want to enter the sites, get out your wallet!  We enjoyed riding around the island, no cars allowed made the riding pleasant.  By the time we got back to town there were so many people we could hardly move.  We had thought we'd walk around and look at the shops, but with the crowds we fled to the dock where we got an inadequate, overpriced lunch and left. Once in Mackinaw City we realized we needed to get away from the hustle and bustle so we rode down Hwy 23 to Cheboygan State Park.   
We ended the day at Rogers City.  The weather was still and comfortable until we got off the bike and realized it was a warm 90 degrees.   
  We cruised along the back roads for about 20 miles, rejoining Hwy 23 at Alpena.  In Alpena we stopped at the library and at a bike shop to pick up a spare tire.  we didn't realize how hot it was until we got off the bike and the humidity closed in on us.  We were immediately soaking wet. Coming out of the library we saw it had rained a little so we hurried on down the road to the campground before any storms hit.  As it turned out, the storm never did materialize. 
We stopped in Harrisville at a great little cafe for some juice and pastry.  We also got good route advice from a local cyclist.  After Harrisville, we experienced a very strong headwind, the strongest of our entire trip.  We plodded on reaching Tawas with time to spare before the storm hit.      The sky was still pretty clear, but we heard thunder in the distance. Thunder storms and torrential rains are really exciting...from a motel room, not a tent.  We didn't even venture out again, we had pizza delivered to our room! 
  We only got a couple miles down the road and it started to sprinkle and it was obvious that it would intensify. We found a large covered truck parking area behind a business and waited a couple hours until the squall passed. After a few more hours we came to Au Gres and found the library so we are taking advantage of the opportunity to update our journal. When we left the library and headed south the sky ahead was black. We quickly headed into a cafe that had a covered place for the bike and got some lunch and tried to wait out the passing shower...it didn't pass though. Since the circus was in town we decided to get a room (the rain wasn't going away anytime soon) and go see the big top show.   
  
  
  
  At the Ontario Visitor Center we picked up maps and chatted with Jim and Grace, a couple on a motorcycle.  We rode around the waterfront and did some sightseeing and shopping before leaving town.  A couple hours later, in the middle of nowhere, we came to an intersection from the west just as Jim and Grace rolled up from the south!  We chatted some more, they gave us a wonderfully cold bottle of ice water, and then said our goodbyes again.    The town of Wyoming was not marked and we rode right past it.  Realizing our error, we backtracked a few miles into a headwind until we came to the campground. 
We continued on toward London, using the directions that Gosse had given us, including a nice bit along the Thames river through town in Springbank Park.    We got to Barbara and Gosse's home and spent quite a while going over routes and maps to help us get to Niagara falls.
  
We rode toward Lake Ontario then up on the Niagara Escarpment through miles of vineyards.  We were never quite lost, but often confused, as the roads in Ontario are not marked as clearly as we are used to.  They also have little or no shoulders.  After what seemed like days, we finally made it to the N.E.T. Campground near Vineland.  It had lousy facilities and misleading advertising.   
From there we caught the bike path south along the Niagara River.  It was very scenic with the river on one side and beautiful bed & breakfast houses on the other.   
We continued on until we reached the home of Bethany and Chuck in Lockport, where we were treated to their generous hospitality.   
We went to town and got a few needed items for the bike and our other gear. We then had a very relaxing day and another very enjoyable evening with Bethany and Chuck.   
   We had lunch and said goodbye at Medina and then we got onto the tow path and headed to Holley. There was a fantastic camp spot at the dock in Holley that even had beautiful new showers.   
It was nice to sit and chat and have a chance to get acquainted. After dinner Leon got out the maps and helped us choose our routes for the next few days.   
  Leon's directions to get us through Rochester were flawless and we had a great ride in spite of the stiff head wind. We enjoyed the rolling hills through the rural areas with plenty of fruit stands to supplement our lunch (fudge too!!).     We had a nice break and celebratory kiss when we passed what should be our last thousand mile mark, 4000!!!!!! The temps and roads were great so we were able to ignore, or at least tolerate, the wind and enjoy the day. When we checked into the somewhat dilapidated Wolcott hotel we were pleased to find another touring couple there too. We met Mark and Kathy, from Oakland, California, later in the bar and had a great evening sharing stories, pizza, beers and ice cream. 
  
Our first flat...As we were leaving we noticed our trailer tire was flat...our record is blemished! It sprinkled off and on all day but never really rained.  It was a bit chilly so we rode in tights and jackets most of the day.  Quite a change from the intense heat of the prairies! It's starting to smell like fall is in the air.   
We rode through many shady areas along the banks of numerous picturesque lakes. We stopped in a small town called Inlet to use their library.  We barely got settled when in walked Marge and Terry, fellow cycle tourists we rode with in Washington, Idaho, and Montana!  Our paths diverged in mid June and here we are 2 months later seeing them again.  We had a great reunion over lunch.   
Down the road a ways things didn't seem right.  We double checked our map and discovered we had missed a turn...mistake #2.  We backtracked up and down the hills 5 miles to the turnoff, which in all fairness to us, was marked very poorly. OK, we're on the right road, what do we do for dinner?  We stopped at the Adirondack Buffalo Farm and bought some veggies and buffalo stix.   At the end of a tough day the Blue Ridge Falls Campground was very accommodating, with a half price tent site.  It's crowded here because of the Labor Day weekend, but it's home for tonight.   
  
After crossing into Vermont, we rode to Middlebury and met Pat and Mike, for a great afternoon of cycling. We crossed Middlebury Gap, boy are the hills steep in Vermont,  and found a place in Rochester for the night. Then we enjoyed a delightful dinner with Pat and Mike before they had to head home.   
  
It was  beautiful riding along the river north toward North Haverhill before turning east and our big climb of the day.  The good road surface and small amount of traffic made for a nice ride in spite of the hill.  We continued on to Lincoln to be close to the bottom of tomorrow's climb over the Kancamagus Pass.   
We woke to cool overcast skies which made for a comfortable ride up the Kancamagus Hwy over the pass.  It was a 12 mile climb, but only the last couple miles were steepish.  It helped to do the climb in the morning and in cool weather.  After reaching the top we had 25 miles of a beautiful downhill.  We had lunch in Conway then crossed into Maine, over our last state line.   
We made it into Buckfield, another very tiny town, and checked into the Buckfield Inn which was cozy and inexpensive.  We had a relaxing afternoon reading their "Down East" magazines in the garden.   
We continued through Augusta picking up state route 3 which would take us all the way to Bar Harbor.  We pushed on until we came to a campground that left a manageable distance for our last day.     The campground came complete with a friendly cat named Larry that entertained us through the evening.   
  We rolled up to the rail at the waterfront in Bar Harbor and had barely gotten off the bike when we were approached by Alice who we met in Montana on June 26th, 3500 miles ago!     She and her husband Ron are from Utica NY and spend time every summer fishing near Yellowstone.  It was incredible to see them here in Bar Harbor almost 3 months later!  We all were enjoying a beer in a restaurant when up walked another woman who had recognized us from a cafe in Inlet, NY.  She was our waitress there when we had lunch with Marge & Terry, after running into THEM coincidentally!  What a small world!!! We said goodbye to Ron and Alice, got a motel room, and walked back for our celebratory lobster and champagne dinner. It's so nice to be done riding, but it's a bittersweet ending.  It will be hard to rejoin the real world, but we have many fantastic memories to take with us.  The wonderful people who make up this country have made this a trip of a lifetime! 
The coupling system worked perfectly. We had no difficulty shipping the bike at all. The disassembly and reassembly was a breeze. We did purchase 2 of the carrying cases (as suggested by the guys at The Bicycle Outfitter) instead of one and it was very easy to fit the bike and extra gear into them. We had only a couple of mechanical problems. The main one was a rear rim failure. We got a new rim in South Dakota and finished our tour, but we have heard from some others who have had problems with the FIR rims too. We now have Mavic rims, from a set of wheels we previously had built for touring. We had to put the old Mavic rim on our new Hadley rear hub because the drop-out width is greater on our new bike but we just switched to our old front wheel.  The other major failure was the Shimano Flite-Deck computer. By the end of the trip even the clock had quit working. We loved the features on it but it was VERY unreliable. Before we left it had failed once and the new one began to fail within 1 month on the road. We now have 2 Cateyes. The tires were bullet proof. We got about 1800 miles out of a set if we rotated them and we did not have one flat on the bike the whole trip of 4800 miles, repeat, NOT ONE FLAT ON THE BICYCLE!! 


We used a MSR whisperlite international stove and the ease of use, easy maintenance, quiet operation, and being able to use unleaded gasoline made it a great choice. We tried to use white gas as much as possible but occasionally we had to use the local gas station for our fuel. Our tent was a Moss Olympic. Our biggest equipment mistake was trusting a 15 year old tent to still be watertight. We didn't have much problem with rain and when it did rain we never really got wet but the floor and rain fly were porous. We should have put a coat of water proofing on them before we left. The other problem with our tent was that it was a bit of overkill for the conditions. We could have used a lighter tent with better ventilation. Most of the time we needed protection from the bugs not the weather. Sometimes we needed to close up the screens but it was too hot, without the screens it was too buggy. We used home made sleeping bag liners (made from old sheets in our bags. When the weather in the plains turned hot they were a blessing. Many nights the sleeping bags didn't even come out. 

   Then, getting more involved and intimate with my bike, I made cycling part of my weekly routine. I got new friends that were into cycling, and that went places, and they made me itch to discover more of the places to go and itch to discover myself through touring. Then I had to decide what I would do for my holidays. It must have been April or May of this year. I had initially 3 weeks holidays, and I thought I would cycle from Vancouver to San Francisco, solo. Then, after visitting so many cycling related web-sites, I came upon the adventure cycling web-site and in the classified there was this woman looking for a partner to cycle the Pacific Coast. It got me curious, I wanted to know how long it would take her, and what was her plan. So I innocently e-mail Joice, and began this partnership that would makeus plan this trip together. So I changed my holiday time, banked some overtime and trained like crazy to make msure my body would be ready for the journey. In the meantime, Joice and I made contact by e-mail and by phone and talked about all the details  of our trip, and what we each wanted for this trip and see if we were compatible. Joice told me she was into running, and cycling and had been trekking to Nepal and aspired to go climbing in South America in a near future. At 43, she was living life to the fullest, taking a full year off work and enjoying things she loved to do. I had positive vibes from our talks and from our e-mails, and we were both so excited about this trip. Cycling the Pacific Coast represented achieving something big to me. To have a goal, to prepare for it, to do it, to face adversity, and to come out as a winner, that was my piece of cake. I was there for the cycling and to reach my goal.


Joice and I left our place right on time as planned: 0800 sharp. My rear tire was somewhat soft so we stopped at the gas station for air and we had our picture taken. I felt happy and excited to leave but somewhat worried because even just a couple of blocks after leaving, Joice was way behind! Oh-oh! There were warning signals in my head, especially when after the very first hill, I was waiting for her and waiting and she showed up finally walking her bike! I was disappointed of not being able to push it and cycle at my full capacity. I had to stop biking and wait for her many times. I must admit that the way to go to the Tsawassen ferry is not nice: busy industrial road, a bridge to cross, lots of big trucks and not much shoulders at times. That was one of the reason I wanted to push it a bit, because there ws nothing nice about this road. Lots of debris on that road, especially shoes, different kind of shoes, a swivel chair wheel, lots of nails, a reflective hunter vest, and few DOA (district of attorney) animals of all kind. The fresh dead seagull on the way to the ferry was not nice to see. The ferry ride was quite nice in a cycling day, breaking the cycling in 2 parts. You must have seen the face of the booth attendant when we told her where we were heading (San Diego). That was priceless! We decided to take the busy road as the quiet road would leghten the day cycling and took highway 19 to Victoria. Joice and I agreed we'd meet downtown Victoria as she felt bad of being slow and wobbly on her bike. I felt like a caged animal with lots of energy and wanted to be freed. So I was relieved that she didn't mind riding on her own. At the first turn off, I would wait for her, we decided. We were heading for the hostel knowing that we had to get up early the next day for the ferry. Unfortunately the hostel was full so we headed for the closest campground which was 15 km away. Joice and I really enjoyed the Galloping goose cycle path going there.Thetis Lake campground, cheaper than the hostel, was RV land. There were mobile homes too. The owner perched us on top of a steep hill, that we walked up, and found ourselves on a very small campsite, but oh well. Joice was very tired, she had a rough day but yet she impressed me; I thought she would give up.I was tired too because I was trying to catch up on my sleeping hours, recovering from night shift work, and yes, I had a stressful day.   
The ferry ride was nice as we talked to our neighbors and a lot of people were impressed with our trip. We even got a couple that gave us their phone number to use if we were in trouble in Oregon. I had some more work to do on the quilt I was working on and when I had it out, the ladies around asked to see and were impressed with the work. (This was mostly the work of my internet quilting group). Then in the middle of the Georgia Straight, I got a bit sea sick as the ferry was gently rolling from one side to the other. Fortunately the shore got closer and closer and soon enough we were on firm ground. Port Angeles is not so pretty and was into the fog, and Joice and I had few errands to run before taking off for our destination of the day. Groceries, post office and libraries would be a common trend for the rest of my trip. My webmail didn't work when I tried to log on and I was quite disappointed of that. After the internet session, we left for Crescent lake which is quite pretty but on a windy and narrow road. Our guide book was warning us about that section and there was a button to activate a warning sign for motorists that cyclists were on the road. I thought it was a pretty ride and not much traffic was on the road. The sky was threatening to fall off, so I was wanting to push myself and set up camp before the rain. I met up with Danielle and Hilde right by the campsite, at the little store by the lake. The 2 friends were from Belgium and now living in Switzerland , cycling down the coast and travelling very light. They had only one tent and decided they would be camping only if it was not raining. They didn't have a stove either, having one meal a day at the restaurant and the dinner meal would be bread and cheese, or cold cuts. Joice joined me there, maybe 10 or 15 minutes after I arrived. Danielle and Hilde would take a hotel that night while Joice and I set up camp in a desert campsite. The rain started  just about as we pitched our tent, so we dressed up warmly and proceeded to cook our dinner. Joice expressed feeling rushed on this trip, she would like to have more time off the bike, lingering in small towns, talk to the locals, etc...I feel like pushing myself, and get the hell out of Washington State before the whole sky falls on us. I hope that we find a middle ground, I wrote in my journal. I had some bike problems today. (So early in my trip) The problem is that I can't shift gear in the front rings. Oh-oh. I was meaning to try to fix it but the rain got to me and the darkness too. No bike shop in sight for a long time. The other problem was my right grip shift grip was getting quite run down and torn. It is a tough item to replace as I tried to have it replaced but 2 bike shops didn't have the grip anymore.     
We left the campsite late, and started up the hill. I was all geared for the rain, long pants included, booties and oh, all of it! On top of the hill, (3km hill) I was way too hot as the sun was started to peek out, so I changed and told Joice we would meet up at the first cafe we would encounter. I got there and waited and waited, and got cold, and she showed up, wanting a burger. That was after 1 hour cycling and we still had 75 km to go! I told her that we were kind of late in our schedule and that she would be better off to continue on cycling to make it to the next campsite before dark. Poor Joice! She couldn't stand being deprived of a greasy burger and she left. We met up again in Forks, where I offered to dry her sleeping bag in a laundromat while she kept on pedalling. I took on the occasion to dry my tent while the sun was out. At Forks, I got to the library to check my e-mail.  I couldn't access my e-mail for some reason and it was driving me crazy, especially that I didn't write down anybody's e-mail addresses, I had it all set up on the webmail.  Leaving Forks we met up with this cyclist, a Andre Agassi look alike that has been cycling from Vancouver to Baja, then dropped his bike and backpacked the Copper Canyon and cycled back from Baja to Vancouver. Very impressive. He had all his load on his rear rack, including his backpack and a full size guitar!  We still had 50 km to pedal from that point and it was closee to 3 PM.(Remember that this is nearing fall and it gets dark by 7). I told Joice I would meet her at the campsite, and left. The ride was good, a bit long. Scenic. Not much traffic. Got rained on real good, one of those quick showers (Joice didn't get it) then finally made it to the beaches. Wow! The sound, the smell, the sights!!! This is what I came for! Very impressive. I did a bit of a detour and stopped at the very first beach, took a picture and headed towards the campground. At that point, all I could get for gear on my bike was the small ring at the front. Geez! Lots of spinning.Lots of swearing. I was tired too.    I made it to the campsite at 1800 or 1830, and met up with 2 cyclists, a couple from Burnaby, BC, Gael (a guy) and Heather.They are heading to Mexico, maybe Guatemala!!! 4 months of pure bliss!  I set up camp right net to them.And that night Gael helped me fixing my speed changing problem. I was very thankful for that. Joice made it to camp shortly before dark. I was sure glad to see her. I was getting worried. She was starting to mention that she might not carry on, being quite sore in her knees and tired. She wanted her boyfriend Jeff to come and pick her up from Seattle. I felt bad and a bit guilty that she was having such a hard time and did not enjoy herself. I had food ready for her: macaroni in a creamy alfredo sauce with tuna. Yummy! Shortly after eating, we cleaned up, talked openly about what we were feeling and thinking and went to bed. One incident that made me careful for the rest of my trip was when I turned on my little gas stove and I obviously was way to close from it as I got a flame in the face as the gas is quite volatile! I could smell burnt hair shortly after that. Fortunately there were no mirrors in the washrooms. No showers either. 
It was a lonesome ride today as Joice and I agreed to meet at the campsite, at the end of the day. We agreed on a shorter day today to allow her knees to get better. There were open lands, logged fields, and I saw lots of bear scats today. Being alone in such a quiet place with only few cars passing by, I was a bit worried about the bears, so I starting shouting around: "bear scats! bearrrrrrr scaaaaaaatttts!!!" (don't ask me why) I was also looking around in the bushes for movements of black beary faces. Towards the end of my ride, I thought I could see bikes on the horizon, but this would never materialize, until almost my turn off to the campsite, where I saw them for sure, those 2 young guys, Alec and Greg, cycling from Victoria to San Francisco. We talked a bit, learning that they would cycle a bit more than Joice and I today but we thought we would see each other farther down the coast. I set up camp at July Creek State Park, just as the sky fell off on me (once more). Awaiting for Joice, I changed, gathered wood, and made myself a hot drink. An hour later Joice came in, in better spirits than the previous days but with sore knees. She rode with Hilde and Danielle today and really enjoyed that as they have the same pace and style.I was glad that she found people to ride with, as they promised to meet up again tomorrow. I went on the other side of the lake Quineault for laundry, which happened to be a longer ride than expected. I put my cycling shoes in the dryer as they had refused to dry totally. Met up with Danielle who was sharing a hotel room with Hilde very close to the laundromat. I came back to our campsite after dark and Joice was getting worried. I also came back very wet, more than ever as the rain had started again and it was quite heavy. All that for drying my shoes. Dinner was on the table, thanks to Joice,and we ate quickly, before heading back to our respective tent for protection and for the night. It rained really hard all night, and our tent were in a bit of a slope, I was worried that the trench made on the uphill would get clogged and we'd get flooded. Our tent were all muddy already when we called it a night.
Once I cycled past Humtulips, I could see a bit of blue sky! I could then start the process of drying. Impressive. Finally! I had an encounter with a german sheppard. He came to me showing his teeth. I was scared. Really. So here I am, getting my nicest softest voice: "Hi!!! How are you? Good dog" He retreated back home, to my greatest relief. It left me a bit shaky for a while. But quickly forgotten, as I was heading once more towards the beaches and the weather was improving some more! The first beach I hit, I cycled to it and took my tent out for drying. It was one of those long endless beaches, and cars were allowed on it as the sand was quite packed. After repacking everything, I carried on, stopping in this small farm market where I bought for 80 cents of fruits, some grapes and 2 peaches. The lady at the counter told me to take 2 apples extra! I was very grateful for that, watching my cash flow and writing down every penny spent along my journey. I then carried on south until the end of the road and enquired about the ferry we had to take to go on the other side of the jetty, to Westport. We would be 6 cyclists on this ferry, Joice and I, Danielle and Hilde, and Greg and Alec, the 2 young guys.       We met Gael and Heather at Twin Harbor State Park and shared a campsite for 6$ total. That ended to be less than 1$ per person! (Gael got the hiker-biker fee for 6$ and then asked to be transferred to a regular site considering that the campground was not busy, then invited all of us to share his site!) I have to mention that I had my first shower since leaving Canada. You can't imaging how good it felt to get the warm water on my body and to scrub the sweat and dirt. Some neighbors of ours, 2 sites away from us were having a fishing and drinking mission and invited us to warm up and dry our clothes by their fire at night. They were quite the camping gourmets and were cooking all kind of stuff that would make anybody but especially a hungry cyclist salivating. To each of us they pushed a plate of freshly BBQ salmon under our nose, which was very yummy, even if we had full dinner before. We dried our clothes (managed to make a hole on both my newly bought cycling socks) and talked for a while but I excused myself early sensing they were getting quite drunk and obnoxious. The good news is that we've been told that the good weather is on our side!!! 
The road was pretty flat, and quiet on this early morning. I hit a quilt store in the first hour of riding. It made my day! I had to get in of course and saw this beautiful raffle quilt that displayed in one of the magazine. I purchased a ticket and left all the fabric I liked behind and left. One of my knee was hurting, probably an overuse injury. I had been carrying some of Joice's equipment for a few days (to facilitate her rides) and combined with 5 days cycling, I guess it was a lot of pressure on my joints and muscles. I promised to go easy today.  Met up briefly with Gael and Heather who were having lunch in a really prime spot, on the beach. It was really pretty and the bright sunshine was making it easy to appreciate even more the scenery. The rest of the road till Raymond was quite diversified, sometimes in the forest, sometimes along a big muddy bay. The common thread was that it was very quiet, not much traffic and good riding. I waited that I cycled at least 50 km before I stop for lunch. And when I was ready for lunch, there was nowhere to stop! So I went overtime and finally reached this baseball field with a couple of pik nik tables and gladly got off my bike. There were 3 other people having lunch and they invited me to join them. Randy was around 45 yo and his parents that were celebrating their 50th wedding anniversary by traveling across the USA. They offered me sandwiches, drink, snacks, and what not! It was quite overwhelming. I left that lunch spot heavier that when I came, loaded with food that those people gave me. Raymond was nothing to be excited about, it was a saw mill town and also a fishing village. North Bend was next to it and more of a fishing town and I stopped there to read my e-mail, at the library. Now I spent an hour and a half there trying to figure out my webmail and my address book, and was quite embarrassed and uncomfortable by the smell of my feet. I enjoyed getting news from my friends. I met Gael and Heather at the library and left for the campsite which wouldn't be that far. I saw at least 3 dead snakes on the pavement and lots of live and well cows, and found myself mooing at them and waiting to see their reactions. That would be a favorite game of mine all along the coast. I made it first at the campsite and got to celebrate the day with a really good malt beverage, and waited for my friends. Gael and Heather followed and then before dark, tired Joice. I am tired too mind you and am looking forward to my day off in Astoria.  I saw the sunset for the first time of this trip. I was standing there, alone on the edge on a cliff and watching the big plunge in the Pacific and waiting for the nice colors to show up afterwards. That was nice. I was hoping for many more to come!    Danielle and Hilde came quite late, well after the sunset, as one of them forgot her watch at a lunch spot and realized it much later. They turned around and looked for it and were quite delayed by it. We were all glad they were safe. We all were in bed when they had dinner, and they were giggling quite a bit, speaking Dutch and I was wondering what it was all about. Well it happened that they had never seen racoons but heard about their theft habits at night. We had warned them to hang their food like we did that night with ours. Danielle asked me whether the racoon liked bananas, with her coarse Dutch voice. That was funny. The whole campsite started to laugh! I was crying out of laughter, and my stomach was hurting. Laughter is the best medecine...   
I reached Seaview where finally there was a bit of life, and treated myself with some Pepsi. I was hoping to be joined by Gael and Heather, but after 20 minutes, I left again, this time slower. I met them entering Ilwaco, where we stocked up for lunch and headed to the Columbia George lighthouse, Fort Camby State Park. With commanding views of the ocean we shared lunch together and had a picture taken with the lighthouse in the background.    There was a huge visitor center at that park and Gael wanted to spend time learning about the history of  Lewis and Clark so I left them at that point and went my own way. I learned about myself that I didn't really like historical stuff too much, and that I prefered cycle the route all at once, or close rather than linger along the way and make it to camp later. I visited the center, but definitely didn't read all the explanations, as I don't have the patience and the information doesn't register anyways.  The riding towards Oregon was interesting: following the Columbia River, going East towards the bridge that would lead me into a different state and a next step into my cycling trip. There was a tunnel to cross, with a big cyclist-operated "cyclist in tunnel " sign. That was OK. It just makes a lot of noise when there is a car in the tunnel. Shortly after that, I was on the long bridge that led me into Oregon. I had a bit of an emotional moment but not enough not to notice the freshly dead seagull right into the 2 feet wide bike lane on the bridge. I did my best to avoid it.     In Astoria, I went to the visitor center to get my free Oregon Coast cycling map and directions to the bike shop, library and grocery store. I headed then to the Fred Meyer which is kind of a big Cosco to buy groceries for dinner. The first tragedy of the trip happened when I wanted to lock my bike. I had the U-shape of the lock but not the other part! I must have lost it somewhere along the way. I ended up putting my bike inside the store and thought "oh well, if it's just the worst that can happen to me on this trip, I am lucky". I thought I would buy a new lock tomorrow.   I made it to camp by 1800, late considering that the sun sets by 1900 and that Joice, Hilde and Danielle were way slower, stopping often. Waiting for the others to arrive, I pitched my tent, drank my malt drink, wrote an entry in my journal, and then Gael and Heather arrived...with the other piece of my lock, and the cable that I use with it.Wow! It made my day! Gael found it just about 35 km behind as I left Fort Camby. He thought it could be mine and carried it all that way to find out. Yay! Thank you, thank you, thank you!!!! The other good news was that our neighbors who were camping as a group of quiet retired couples went fishing that day and came back with a lot of crab, cooked it and asked if we could please take as much as we wanted because they had way too much... Heather, Gael and I looked at each other in disbelief and felt like it was Christmas. I later on passed again by their campsite on my way to the shower and they gave me 3 of those yummy italian plums, which made me a bit teary as I gratefully accepted them. This was way overwhelming. I did not expect that much generosity from complete strangers. I am so thankful for all these kind gestures that made my day. I waited a long time for Joice that night, but 2 hours after dark, figured out she wouldn't show up that night. Neither Danielle and Hilde even though we promised to meet at the campsite. The campsite happened to be more expensive because of their no-show. I was worried about them, wondering what might have happened disastrous that prevented them not to come. Part of me knew that they were ok, just caught by darkness and a long day cycling. Tomorrow is a day off, I am really thankful for that. I had laundry to take care of, and my bike needed the handle grip repair and a derailleur job, maybe even crash on the beach. 
The morning was a leisurly one, slow rise and shine, no picking up and packing up everything. Nice breakfast with Gael and Heather. I got into the habit of eating the same yummy breakfast and every evening I would make sure I had everything I needed for my morning feast: bagel with peanut butter, a banana and some hot chocolate. After that I headed in town to run my errands. I left my bike in confidence to the bike mechanic and walked to the library for my e-mail, and surprise! Joice was just getting out of there!!! I was so happy to see her alive and well, that was a big relief! We hugged! She told me that Danielle, Hilde and her made it quite late in Astoria last night, and in fact it was dark as they crossed the bridge. They were looking for their way and asked directions to this woman who invited them in her home overnight. Wow, that generosity thing again... Joice and I parted again after I gave her the directions for our campsite and I went on with doing my e-mail thing and came back to my bike which was now fixed and ready to tackle any hill with all its speed gears  I wanted. It cost me 30$ US but oh well... I needed it, I was glad it was done, I will pay it when the bill comes back on my credit card... I then headed back "home" and right before entering Fort Stevens State Park, after shopping for food, I got a flat tire. Well, that was OK because I had Pepsi with me. It was really hot so I sat down, had a sip and got to fix my flat  (a big staple). I was happy to do it. It was almost a convenient time to have a flat, when I'm not that loaded... Returning to camp quite sticky and plain dirty, I got to clean up my very filthy bike and had a shower. Laundry was next on the list and I went to the KOA that was in front of the state park. I didn't have any soap with me and the laundromat or the little store didn't have single load soap so I asked another camper at the laundromat if she would sell me some. She told me I could take it, for free... For dinner we had the 2 boys, Greg and Alec joining us from 2 days ago, and along with Joice made 6 of us. I made Joice a sweet and sour vegetable stir-fry with cashews on a bed of rice with wine-she liked it.
   Seaside came and I went by the beach, had a picture of me taken and headed towards Canon Beach.     Stoping in towns is a bit shorter when I ride on my own. First I don't feel the need to stop as much and there is nobody to share the moment with so I prefer riding.  So still facing strong headwind (lots of white caps on the ocean) I made my way to Canon Beach which is is a cute tourist town just south of Seaside. I took a side trip to Ecola State park. The 3 miles service road was more than hilly. There were steep section to it that I wished there was another smaller gear after my granny gear. But the scenery was really worth it. Only I wished I had company to share the moment with. The winds gusts made me unsteady on my feet and I had to brace myself to walk to the peninsula that would give me tremendous views of the north and south coast. It was georgous! The picture I took, I had to hold the camera using a lot of strenght and had to watch the scarf on my head too... Good thing there was no rain to that storm!      Then I headed to Canon Beach, in its busy touristy street and purchased something for my lunch and for dinner later on. Even though it was pretty, I didn't linger too much as I had more cycling against the wind to do, and few hills to climb. The climb out of Canon beach got quite hairy because of that head wind. The sand would come in a cloud, I had to keep my mouth shut and my eyes too at times as I do not wear protective glasses when cycling and the wind gusts would sometimes push me towards the road, in the traffic. Then I hit the tunnel. There was a cyclist-operated warning signal, thankfully. I waited for the big semi to pass, activated the light and sped through the tunnel, hoping for no cars to pass by. On the opposite way came 2 dirt trucks that made a terrifying noise in the tunnel and then behind them they brought the vacuum wind. I got a bit emotional on my way out, I guess I was a bit scared and nervous in there. I was as well quite surprised to notice how the weather changed on the other side of the tunnel (and the mountain): big low clouds, threatening to burst, and cold enough to wear my windbreaker. I carried on, downhill and then back up again. I was getting tired. I made it to camp by 1530,the way I like . Tired and relieved that I made it safely. The last hill had been quite difficult on top leaving me exposed to the traffic and fighting with all my strenght the fierce wind so I am not pushed off my bike and pushed in the traffic. I made it.  I pitched my tent,unloaded the bike and cycled back in town again to get some camping fuel for the group. It happened that the price of a  gallon was the double of what I normally pay so I left it there. I found myself a library and went reading and sending e-mails. Joice didn't make it to camp till 7:45 that night. I was worried, hungry and perhaps a bit angry. Well, it happened that, right before Seaside, she and a car collided as she was pushed by a gust of wind. Very shaken by the event, she had almost made arrangements to return to Seattle. She left camp late, waiting for Hilde (Danielle was heading to Portland for her return flight) which drives me crazy because daylight is a ressource for cyclists. I am worried when she doesn't come by sunset. I kind of feel responsible for her. Her morale was pretty low that night, and I didn't know what she wanted to do, carry on or go home.. That night I started  contemplating that I might be on my own in a very short time. The last entry on my journal that night was that I really enjoyed myself on this trip.... and Joice, not so much. I have to talk about the "Jurassic Park effect" in some of the campsites in Oregon. In some places when you want to reach the beach like in Nehalem bay, you have to climb a sand dune, say 50 feet high, maybe more. Then you have a really nice ocean view, and a really nice wild beach, nice sand. But if you turn around towards the campsite, you would see a forest, no real high trees but hiding most of the RV's and buildings. I would expect to see a dinosaur's head emerging from a hill or from a bush... I had that thought few times in Oregon. So wild....   
In Tillamook, I stopped to the very touristy cheese factory and bought some cheese curds.(Later on everybody at the campsite would turn their head on the delicacy because of the word curds). I had stopped here last year as well and had seen the displays but hey, who would say no to free cheese tasting???  The quilt museum was the next stop on my list and I admired a very beautiful applique quilt made by a local group. I took a picture and talked with the ladies for a bit, admitting that I missed my quilting and working on my many projects.    After groceries and some e-mail at the library, I headed towards the 3 Capes loop, a very scenic and quiet road off highway 101 that would hug the coast and offer wonderful sceneries. Last year was one of my favorite place! I stopped for blackberries along the way, thinking that I should have done that way earlier on my trip as these were really yummy!  Cape Meares was quite steep, and long (3 miles of fairly steep climbing); I worked hard for that one, singing to change my mind and to stop thinking about my sore thighs. I met up with Hilde on top and Gael and Heather joined in. We cycled to the lighthouse together. It was sure hilly.  On one of the long and fast descent, I lost my handlebar bag as I sped into potholes that I didn't expect and as I forgot to lock it on to the handlebar. Well, I almost ran on it and almost had a pretty bad accident. That taught me a lesson as it really scared me. The rest of the ride was pretty uneventful but I got tired towards the end, and I kept having flashbacks from my last year's trip which disturbed me a bit. Finally in camp, I quickly set up, hopped into a delightful hot shower and put on some warmer clothes. The sunset anounced itself and I ran to the beach to watch it. The sky got all orange and the surf was beautiful.      Cape Lookout is one of my favorite campground on the Oregon Coast but today was very crowded as we were Friday. So lots of people on the beach, some dogs pulling their masters as they wanted to play or to sniff other dogs... It was an interesting sight- lots of action on the beach. Dinner was interesting too as Joice and I didn't share meals anymore as I told her I could not wait for her to show up anymore to have dinner. We agreed in the morning that if we were to arrive at different times  (ie: her coming late) it would be better to plan our own meal. It felt weird, as we were sitting at opposite sides of the table. It felt like I was distancing from her. My thought today was that I had to stop to mother her. She had to take responsibility for herself and her actions. I wonder what she would have to say if I told her that as this was my feeling, maybe she didn't feel that at all. I went to bed early and found my earplugs in the bottom of my bag as we had very noisy and obnoxious neighbors. Typical Friday night in a campsite... 
I started cycling by 10AM which is late for me. I left with Hilde, but she fell behind quickly, having met some Swiss cyclists to talk to. There was a 1000 feet hill to climb right out of the campsite so I warmed up quite quickly! I got sweaty, started to breathe the most effective way for the exercise output and spun my pedals! I was sure glad once I reached the top. I waited for Hilde maybe 10 or 15 minutes but as she was not coming, I left.  Down the hill there were sand dunes on the left and right side of the road, a pretty and different sight. I remember that section from last year. The sand had drifted on parts of the road shoulder, narrowing the road especially if a car had to pass me. A little further down, there were some pastural decors, and I had a chat with the cows. At some point I stopped by a fenced field and all the cows came very close, pushing one another for a better view of the strange person with a scarf and helmet on her head.    I ate cheese curd right in front of them and told them they wouldn't have any. Then for dessert I had some very yummy blackberries. My fingers- and probably my tongue too- got all purple! Cape Kiwanda is another favorite place of mine. Nice stumpy rock not far from the coast and sandy beach. I bought myself some Pepsi and sat on the beach for a while, watching the trucks and the cute surfers getting on and off the beach.Shortly after noon, it was time to go. Soon after that the road was following a river emerging on to the ocean and again there was a lot of action, lots of small boats clustered at the same spot for good fishing and lots of shore fisherman trying their luck. I saw a rather large salmon being caught, which was quite exciting.    Next, I hit a quilt store, to my big surprise as this place was quite rural. It was signed on the road as a tourist attraction so I followed the signs off my way a bit and ended up in a house basement with 2 quilters and lots of bolts of fabric. We chatted for a while, and I got to miss my quilting and fabric handling. They warned me about the upcoming hill right before Lincoln city, and they were very surprised that I was traveling by myself, happily talking about this guy cyclist that had been stopped on the roadside and robbed of his money and valuables. Thanks ladies! The Lincoln city hill was steep, the quilters were right on that. It climbed forever, winding lots and in and out of the sunshine, making it quite hot when the sun was hitting the pavement. I found Hilde again right close to Lincoln city but we parted as I stopped for groceries. We had to prepare for cheese fondue that night!!! Yummy. Hilde left us that night to have a longer day as she had a restricted time to reach San Francisco. I reached camp by 1530. I was the first one to arrive. Pitched the tent and headed for the library. My e-mail was nice to read but I didn't have enough time. I felt kind of homesick. I felt sort of excluded from the group because Joice and I were not sharing dinner anymore. It felt really weird and uncomfortable. The cheese fondue was great! We had 4 different cheeses and some garlic and some wine in it. Then 4 bottles of wine to help the cheese down. Joice and I got a bit happy for a while, giggling a bit. That was fun. We ate quite well. So in general it was a great day, great scenery, great cycling and a great dinner. Tomorrow was another day off-I could have done without but the group decided to have one to have everyone rested at the same time (Greg and Alec needed a day off). My biggest concern about this day off was to find out something to do. Linclon city is not real exciting to me.   
Gael, Heather and me went for laundry (Wow! Nice clean clothes!) and then headed for a renown clam chowder restaurant for lunch (Mo's). I was not craving at all a meal at the restaurant and sure didn't want to spend the money but ended up joining my group. I had a salad and some fries conscious about the greasy food as I didn't want to gain weight on this trip!!!    After a group picture session, we headed back against the wind, stopping  to the library for e-mail. I must have spent 1 and a half hour composing this really nice e-mail for all my friends and family. From day 1 to day 7, the whole Washington State story. I pressed "send", then there was an error message and I tried to get back to find out what I did wrong and .. I lost the whole e-mail. I was so mad, yet there was nothing I could do. I am so unlucky with my e-mails. After being back in camp, I was watching Gael fixing and cleaning his and Heather's bike and he showed me a bit how to true a wheel. He taught himself to build wheels and was quite knowledgeable about the matter. I wanted to check a bit my back wheel,as I knew it was way out of true. So I turned my bike upside down and found out with Gael a huge crack on my rim at a spoke base. The rim needed replacement, and now!!! The next bike shop was 40 km away from here. I hoped I could make it and I hope that I could catch up with my buddies afterwards depending on how fast the bike shop could do the repair and if they had a rim for me. I had a good dinner: Ramen noodles with corn, cheese and broccoli and a glass or 2 of Zinfandel. We all retired early into our tents in prevision of our longer day tomorrow. As for me I wanted to get up earlier just to allow more time for repair or in case I had to hitchhike or anything like that. I was kind of stressed out with the idea of riding with such a big problem.
I made it without any other incidents to Newport by 1100, left my bike in confidence and headed to the library which was only one block away! I took advantage of the free time to stock up in food and had lunch . My bike got ready by 1300 and after giving 85$ in US funds, I had a newly refurbished mean of transportation!!! Right before taking the Newport bridge I found the quilt store Darlene was suggesting me to stop at and indeed, it was well worth the stop! Lots to salivate about and yes, I missed my quilting! I didn't buy anything (good girl) and carried on. I passed Newport bridge and met up with what looked like hard core, big calves, lightweight bikes cyclists. One of them was in a wheelchair. We said hi, and followed each other for quite a while. Tail wind helping I reached and maintained a speed of 36-40 km per hour with and then without the boys as they slowed down. I think that they were impressed with me as I could keep up with them and as I was way heavier loaded than they were. I passed them a few times. It was nice to push myself a bit. They stopped in Yachats-I carried on. The ride was so scenic, and it was so fun!!! I had a blast!. I made it to camp by 4:30 PM. Even with my 2 hours break in Newport, nobody made it before me. I pitched my tent, had a delightful shower, had some soup, went for a walk. Heather and Gael made it by 6PM. That was nice to see them. Greg and Alec came shortly after that and Joice made it before dark. Must have been 7PM. She got a flat tire today and it took her 2 hours-so she says to fix it. She never fixed one before.    Tomorrow will be an easier day. Will stop for e-mail in Florence and we will have chocolate fondue for dessert as a group at night. Yummy!!! 
   I made it to the Lighthouse State Park, but not first as usual: Greg and Alec were all set up. It was pretty cold at camp because of the fog. There was the fog horn making noise a few times per minutes, and it carried on for the whole night too. You kind of tune it out after a while. I felt kind of uncomfortable with Greg and Alec because I found that we didn't have much in common, not much to say. Their motto for this cycling trip (and they insisted that they weren't cyclists) was : the easy way out, which mean they would take the easiest route, the shorter one and rest was important. I didn't make too much effort to keep a conversation with them. Joice really like them. She was always bugging them, arguing and kept saying that they could have been her sons. Whatever. I felt a bit out of the group that night again, kind of rejected, maybe except for the time we shared the chocolate fondue. Actually, nobody had chocolate fondue before so I introduced them to the delight of this yummy dessert!    We fought for the chocolate and shared fruits, the strawberries and bananas being the most popular. I will remember that one. Joice exempted herself from the fondue with the pretext that she had too much chocolate in her panniers to eat even more of it. Whatever. I went to bed early that night after warming up at the little fire that we had going, donation of wood from some fellow campers. 
The rest of the day I would keep thinking about being on my own tonight. Part of me is not bothered by it all. In fact I am yearning for a bit of solitude. Part of me is bothered by the security aspect of being a woman and travelling on my own. During the day, no problem. It's at night. A campsite like the one I left this morning, no problem. I am worried about quiet and remote hiker-biker sites. I phoned my sister in Paris that morning and it was good to talk with her. The line cut right in the middle of our conversation, I think it was her cell phone battery that died. I would have talked to her longer, maybe to get some encouragements from her as I needed it. So I cycled the 106 km today remembering the route John and I did last year; I can't wait to be out of Oregon and see something different and not have that history to think about, and places we went. I fell today. I was in the Seven Devils loop (what's in a name? ) which is a very tiring ride with lots of up and down, some of them quite steep. I was trying to get into the smaller ring and the chain got stuck-again. And I fell, right in the middle of the quiet road as I was going uphill. More fear than hurt, but it sure bruised my ego. A car stopped, and the man lowered his window as I was still sitting on the pavement and enquired whether I was ok. Yes, I am ok. Thanks. Bandon is a real nice funky place. I like it. I arrived there in the afternoon, passing my campsite to spend some time in town, do my e-mail, get groceries and even check out the quilt store. I must have spent an hour in town and returned towards my campsite, where I queued for the check in, taking my place in the traffic behind those monster RV's with satellite dish and BBQ and microwave oven and the jeep behind for town cruising. Well, my transportation was real cheap gas! And I didn't take that much room, and I could eat what I wanted and not gain weight. There. I shared the hiker-biker with a strange character, a cyclist doing only the Oregon Coast, a man that must be in his early 40's and not looking so fit. We talked briefly as I was filling my pot with water for cooking and was sure glad he kept his distances as I wanted to be alone. I had a delightful shower, as usual, cooked myself a good meal (Ramen noodles) and a glass of Zinfandel, and got to eat chocolate and went to bed early after failing at lighting a fire. I remembered being worried about racoons as I had my food with me in the tent, and was hoping not to have any confrontation, which didn't happen.
   I ended up having to backtrack a couple of kilometers for the laundromat. Sorting out my dirty clothes, this lady approached me and asked: "Are you travelling on your own?" I said: "From now on, yes". She replied: "Aren't you scared with all the bad stuff that is happening around?". I had an answer for her: "Well, I don't read the papers, it's way too scary! But really so far on my trip, everybody have been very kind." I really meant it. Then I headed to the library just to see if one e-mail I sent the previous day had been replied. My friend indeed replied and I read:" Knowing you well you must be worried about being on your own". Tears fogged my sight as I exited and left Bandon and I was kind of upset for the next 10 km. Yeah, part of me was worried. The unknown. Will I be ok? What if I don't feel safe? I felt relieved after crying a bit. Later that day, I was better. I was cycling. My element. Getting endorphins. I stopped for blackberries but they were getting rotten so I really had to pick well. I couldn't believe that such a gift from mother nature could be left out there and not used for pies, or jam or whatever.  I took a 10 miles detour to Cape Blanco where there is a lighthouse. It didn't matter today as I had a shorter day so I could afford the detour. Last year when we went, we were fogged in and I wanted to see if I could have views of the cape, and the shoreline this time. The ride there was pretty, passing through fields of hay, country homes and then the state park with glimpses of a very pretty stream meandering throught the land. Patches of fog hung out by the coast but still, here and there I could manage to see a bit of the shore.    Back on the main route, I met up with a tandem in Port Orford, Theresa and Jeff who were leisurly cycling down the coast, no real goal, just where their bike would take them. We chatted for a while and I stayed there a bit longer sipping my Pepsi and looking at the great scenery.    I was getting tired and knew  the last section to my campsite was hilly so I was trying to gain some energy. At the end, I made it just fine to Humbug which wasen't so far away after all neither it was so difficult and set up camp at the hiker-biker site. I remembered that Gael and Heather said they would be at Humbug that night but I came to believe that they would not make it. I met up with Jake from Seattle and Debbie from Vancouver, who cycled together that day but didn't know each other before that. They are quite the seasonned cyclists, as Jake likes to cycle 90 miles a day and Debbie rides 100 km a day. Both are going to San Francisco, and both had a limited time to get there. I was sure glad to meet both of them. I went for another delightful shower and back to the campsite, after I had  hot chocolate came Gael calling my name. I was surprise to see him and he said that they had a campsite in another section. I was hesitating to move with them as I really thought I would have more fun with Debbie and Jake but moved anyways, just to be nice. After meeting again everybody I announced that today would be our last night as I wanted to go the distance tomorrow and always. I also added, to explain myself a bit better, that I felt it was time to say goodbye and to go my own way.  We had dinner: for me it was mashed potatoes and pastrami, along with fried onions and pepper. Not so great but oh well. I ate it all. After dinner I went back to my old site to see Jake and Debbie and explain why I played Houddini on them (they were at the beach when I changed site) and I got Debbie's e-mail address so we keep in touch and go cycling together when we would both be back in town. I was hoping to ride with them tomorrow and I figured that I might even meet Jake at the next campsite as I wanted to do 80 miles. 
   We stopped at Gold Beach (name of a town) and had coffee and second breakfast and then we stopped for laundry, also to allow the fog to lift up. After that we headed for Cape Sebastian which look quite steep in my guide book but I managed, slowly but steadily. On top, Jake and I lost Debbie and Jake wanted to see the cape, but oh! That extra uphill was so steep!!! 20% grade. I was on big gears and tried to change to the smallest gear and my chain jammed again and I fell, hurting myself this time, in my crotch and opening my knee-once more. Ouch. I stay sitting for a while till the pain subsides than I lifted my bike and walked up that hill, panting and sweating. Mid-way up, we heard a terrible tire noise and looked down and this truck with a U-Haul trailer lost control and hit the ditch, right where I sat few minutes ago. (It was a good thing I got up). So we turned around and attended to that poor guy. It ended up he was quite shaken but not hurt and the truck's front axel was wrecked.    The rest of the day was tiring and cold. Lots of fog, lots of ups and downs. Jake and I made it to Brookings by  0330 and I decided to stop there for the night, and so did Jake and so did Debbie. After stoping I got really cold, and warmed up only after putting all my layers on and drinking hot soup. Wasn't that ironic that just 2 days ago Brooking was in the middle of a heat wave, climbing as high as 90 degrees? Hard to believe. That night we were 10 cyclists sharing the campsite, and it cost us 1.60$ each!!! That was impressive. I still didn't feel connected to my initial group and was looking forward to leave them behind. Just time to move on. Anyway, Gael and company (including Joice) would have a rest day tomorrow. Joice and I had a hug wishing each other luck before going to bed and promising to write and give news. 
   I was worried that the agricultural check point officer would confiscate my veggies and fruits but it was no problem at all, they waived at us to carry on.  I was really happy to leave Oregon behind as it meant to me leaving memories from last year's trip behind. The way to Crescent city  was very scenic as the cycling route took us in through the back roads, with nice panoramas, some farms, and really nice properties. We got to eat more blackberries! Yummy! We stopped for second breakfast at Crescent City. I had 2 orders of toasts and 3 cups of tea with a lot of sugar in it. (4 teaspoons per cup) (What can I say I am a sweet girl... Then we headed for the hill. "The hill" was long and somewhat steep and marked the beginning of the redwood forests. Large, tall trees surrounded us and thankfully provided some shade while we were climbing. I must have climbed for 30-45 minutes. There was some road work on the uphill section necessitating alternate closure of one way while the other direction would pass by. It got somewhat treturous to ride in between the concrete fence and a logging truck, on a very narrow or no shoulder at all. In general everybody was very careful with me when passing. The scenery of the Redwoods was quite peaceful and quite pretty. But the most spectacular view was on the downhill, joining the coast again. Wow!!! There was a second hill to climb, right after Klamath, and then we got into the Scenic Parkway. Jake waved us goodbye and aimed for Eureka where he had someone inviting him for dinner and overnight. Debbie and I got into our own pace and I stopped at the very touristy "Big tree" where I took a picture.  There were 2 Japanese older men there and once they saw me, asked if they could take a picture of me-an American girl. I didn't mind too much but I am Canadian, I told them. They didn't mind. So I proceeded to stand there by the big tree, with one of them in the picture. The photograph tried to explain with words and gestures to hug and kiss. I said "Well, you're pushing it a bit now" Geez, the nerve! They soon left to my relief and I got my picture taken with my bike in front of the big tree and headed for the campsite.    Debbie was there setting up her tent and I noticed Hilde's tent! She must have gone hiking because she wasen't around. Then there was this Swiss woman cycling for the last 4 months, and smoking a lot too, a not so polite smoker. We took it easy that afternoon and Debbie and I had a really yummy dinner, pastas with carrot and tomato sauce with cheese. It was so good! Debbie hapened to be really good company.  I phoned Darlene confirm my visit tomorrow as she invited me to her home when I would pass by. I met Darlene through the friendship quilt project I started on the internet. We had occasions to get to know each other a bit, through e-mail, but tomorrow, I would get to meet her and see her quilts. I politely asked if Debbie could come too, as she was expecting that Joice would come, and she said yes.  Elk Creek campground is in bear country. Fortunately there were those sturdy metal bear boxes in each campsite, so everything that could smell food, even toothpaste or everything that contained food like clothes I would stash chocolate and gum in would have to go in it. I was very conscious of being bear aware as I knew I would wake up with every little sound in the forest.
   Debbie and I were dressed for winter and enjoyed our warm hands and feet for a while, until the sun warmed the air a bit more. The ride was pretty. We made it to Trinidad for second breakfast (!) by 1030 and enjoyed good pancakes, no guilt!     Trinidad is quite pretty being on a cliff and having a lighthouse providing contrast with the ocean and the green of the trees. We took pictures and I shopped at the quilt store right in front of the restaurant for a present for Darlene.    The next stop was Arcata as Debbie was looking for a bike shop to buy a new front rack as hers broke. In Arcata there was a sort of Woodstock type of gathering, a street fair with people proudly showing their tattoos and piercing. Lots of "weird" young people there, and different stuff to buy: candles, t-shirts, jewellery, etc... We walked our bike for a bit but we had to go because we were expected!  Eureka came and went and for that size of a city it was really weird to see so little people outside for a nice Sunday like that! Well, they were all at the mall! The mall was full. There was nice drafting sessions between Debbie and me in between Arcata and Rio Dell. That was a lot of fun.    After 130+ km we found ourselves being greeted by Darlene in Rio Dell. She was very nice to offer her roof, a shower and laundry, and a cold drink soon after we came! She showed me all her quilts which are really nice. We had dinner (Deb and I were starving)- steak and potatoes- and we chatted for a while. She even offered us to use her computer for e-mail.  I sent everybody an e-mail. Debbie and I ate M&M's and Fig Newton in hiding in the bedroom because we were still hungry after dinner. There was a lot of giggling about it too, I guess because we were feeling guilty of being still hungry. I made a mental note of sending a nice thank you card to Darlene. 
     We ate quite well for breakfast-maybe we ate too much?- as hungry as we were: cereals, muffin, coffee, banana. We got out of Rio Dell and entered Scotia where we stopped for groceries. Scotia is a logging town and the company owns the whole city! I was surprised to be woken up by a siren in the morning, it was actually a wake up call for the employees!  Soon after we entered the "avenue of giants" which pretty much extended all day.    What a spectacle of greenery, tall and big trees, and the Eel river, curvy, offering a beautiful scenery. We stopped for second breakfast, I had an egg and bacon muffin sandwich and 2 toasts and jam that were quite yummy. Gradually it warmed up and the trees left place to a drier environment and we left the avenue of giants for the freeway, and it got so hot! It was hilly which got me in a sweat. That afternoon Deb and I stopped in Garberville, another weird, granola town, and had a cold drink sitting outside. That was our goodbye toast, as Debbie was heading for a longer day and I was heading for a normal one. I was kind of reluctant to say goodbye and face solitude, this time maybe for the rest of my trip. I even considered making the distance to match it up with Debbie but I wasn't sure I could do it. I went to the library to find it closed and went for groceries to find Debbie again!!! I bought myself a bit of wine and some more supply and left for my campsite, which really was not far away. The campsite was really quiet. No cyclists, few RV's, sparse around the park. I asked the host about safety and he said that the ranger was doing rounds at night and that they didn't have any problem for the time he was there. There are food boxes on each campsite to cache our food against the common pest, racoon and skunk. I will not leave my food in my tent tonight, that is for sure. I phoned Bonnie tonight (a friend in Vancouver), just to say hi. We talked for 20 minutes I'd say. I was sure glad to talk with her, not that I was desperate but I needed to share what I was going through with someone. (Okay, I was just a little desperate to talk to someone). Tomorrow I will have to attack the highest peak of the whole Pacific Coast, the Leggett hill, 1894 feet high. It will be interesting. I am a bit worried about the heat. I want to make sure I will have enough energy and enough water. So I ate rice and beans for dinner tonight (Was very yummy). The last comment I have logged that night was that I needed to send a bunch of stuff home, stuff I didn't need anymore, like one of my journal that was getting full, some clothes, some maps. Well let's watch how long it would take me to do that... I saw a lizard near my tent, the first one of how many? It reminded me to zip my tent after and before entering or exiting, as I don't want to sleep with them! Maximum temperature today: 100 Faraneit and the lowest forcasted: 44- yikes. 
The cycling was O.K. A lot of places were quite narrow and the logging trucks were out early. Fortunately all of them were very courteous and gave me lots of room to maneuver. The Leggett hill was nothing to get excited about, really. It's just very long, windy and uphill. Not even that steep! It wasnt't that bad really. Soon and without warning, I started going downhill and having glimpses of the horizon in between the trees. It was difficult to figure out how to dress: I had my reflective jacket to be visible, a tank top underneath for when I'd get hot, but I was sweatty in the uphill and cold in the shade and downhill. I reached the coast, without seeing the ocean, and found myself munching on the blackberries on the roadside. There was another big hill to cycle, and that one got long and quite hot! But I managed. After that I finally emerged by the ocean, and what a spectacle! The next 10 miles were tiring but well worth it: open views of the ocean, the cliffs, and small communities established in peace. I wished someone was with me to share the moment.    Towards the end, I was getting real tired. A german cyclist, older man, passed me and I wasn't of good conversation especially that I could barely understand him. Part of me was scared and I withheld some information, for some reasons: no, I wasen't alone, my friend was ahead, not specifying where I was going to end up tonight, etc... He was much faster than me so he passed me and that was it. Then, more hills and I happened to have low pressure on my rear tire. Oh no!!! Not again! I reinflated twice until it was real obvious that I had a flat tire and ended up changing it, with an attitude. This was less than 1 km away from my campsite but I didn't know it at the time. I must have made it to camp by 1500. I drank a malt beverage quite quickly, to relax after a hard day. Had a shower (another blissful one), went for a walk, ate like a pig, had dinner on top of that, and then went watching the sunset. All by myself. Solitude was great actually. So was the sunset.     
Woke up with an overcast sky. I had slept really well, and woke up past 0730. So this was a "leisurly morning" and I left the campground before 0900.  Arriving in Fort Bragg, the biggest town on the California coast north of San Francisco, everything was still mostly closed as it was not 10:00 quite yet. I spotted a quilt store and another shop that I would have liked to check out. The Safeway was open so I went for groceries and did my shopping for the day. Lots of people asked me on my trip how much my bike weigh fully loaded. I always answered that it depends whether it's before or after groceries. I had thought about that as I was trying to find some room for all the food I had purchased. If the front compartments are full, there is always the top rear rack where I can stack it up and then I look like a real bag lady! Then I was keen to look for the library to do my e-mail, so I tried to look for it on my own then ask someone on the street to direct me to it, and I don't know what it was but I still couldn't find it. It took few people to give me directions to find it and I found it closed. It taught me that I didn't take directions very well, or I didn't listen very well or I was having a bad day to take directions...  So I headed out of town, towards Mendocino, called the "Little New England" of the Pacific Coast. It is a stylish town, with lots of character dream homes, mostly of Victorian style. I was wondering which celebrity lived here, or at least had a summer home. I toured a bit around town, visited a little store full of nice stuff that I would have liked to buy but this was a bike trip and I couldn't buy anything, but something edible...I had a sandwich confectioned just for me and bought some pepsi and went eat lunch in a not so quiet but scenic spot right out of town. I watched the hawks turning and turning in search of their next prey. There were a lot of them.In fact today I probably saw hundred of them unless it was the same and they were following me! The way towards Manchester state park was very scenic, and again lots of up and down and the sun was sometimes more playing peek than playing boo. I made it to camp by 1530 or 1600. Wow, I am 3 days away form San Francisco!!! I met up with Dave at the campsite (which was very quiet). Dave is retired and has been on the road with his wife and dog for the past 5 years in his camper. Wow! They are now waiting on the coast that the temperature gets down a bit in Nevada so they can go visit the children and grandchildren. Dave asked me if I needed anything and I said that I was getting low in salt so he took me to his camper and his wife topped me up in salt and gave me a peach, some V-8 and some Diet Pepsi! It is so hard for me to accept from other people. I said thank you. The weather changed a bit tonight. The wind turned and brought some threatening black clouds. I wonder what tomorrow will be like...         
Ok, I didn't have the best night, I must admit, as in the middle of my sleep I heard a racoon searching my panniers in quest of edible goods. After trying to chase them away from there, I had to get up and relocate my panniers, hang them in trees not so nearby. I got used to the food boxes available in some of the campsites, making it so easy to store the food.. In the morning, I noticed that half my banana was gone!!! (The peel was chewed through) Oh well! The sky was threatening and though there were some patches of blue, the black clouds seemed to take over from the north. I left the campsite by 0830 and started my ride. Point Arena was the first town I hit, and at this hour everything was close. I skipped the detour to the lighthouse as I knew I had a long day ahead. The cows were my company for a while so I played the "moo" game and got some weird look from them and some of them got to moo back to my delight. Then Gualala came and I took a pit stop. It seemed that everybody in town spoke spanish! I found a copy center with a pay internet use and printed my e-mail for reading later. Had a yummy muffin and coffee with a lot of sugar and went to the craft store in the same complex, and bought myself a needlework project to keep my hands busy when time was getting long, especially at night time. This was my first extravagance on this trip. After groceries I hit the road again. It cleared out nicely as the sun was playing hide and seek and I had a nice tailwind. I was going much faster than the previous day, and feeling better too. I reached Fort Ross when I was just about starving. I went in the visitor center, not so interrested in the history of the fort but mostly browsing the books on earthquakes and the San Andreas fault. I chatted a bit with a park ranger and a couple asking about my trip and, cold, went back on the bike. From Fort Ross and on, the vistas started to be just spectacular! The sky became blue on all corners and I was just so happy! I climbed on high, with the ocean  and cliffs on my right side and mountains with very dry grass on my left side. There were cows fields and on few occasions had to cross cattle grills. The views were awesome, and life was good. This was the favorite part of my trip I think. Climbing the hills was effortless and it was so rewarding to see what was around the corner!          Then I hit Jenner, a cute little town marking the end of this section so scenic. Jenner was right by a river which was joining the ocean. I watch the sea lions on an island of sand, playing beach whale. From far they looked like logs but being forewarned by the guide book and looking long enough I could see the "logs" dragging themselves into the sand. Shortly after I reached my campsite and quickly set up my tent. There was nobody at the hiker-biker site and I found some white gas in the food box for my stove! I would top up later but I had to hurry, go into the so delightful shower and in town for laundry. I came back by 1800 to find the hiker-biker site occupied with 2 guys that were touring  locally. I was glad to finally have company but after talking briefly I realized that I was disturbing them so I retreated to my quarters. I had a nice dinner with pasta, tomato sauce, fried onion, garlic, mushroom and cheese. It was quite yummy. This little kitten was around and begging for food, probably very hungry, lost and scared. I felt sorry for the little guy and didn't know what to do, to feed him? To capture him and take him to the park rangers? I feel sorry I didn't do anything. (In general they say not to feed the wildlife). Checking the guide bood I noticed that I was getting quite close from San Francisco and so I had to make plans to avoid disappointment. I went to bed after working on my cross-stitch and  being irritated by the fog horn. 
It was very foggy when I left and the coast stayed foggy till at least 10 or 1030  but I headed inland and got my jacket off as soon as I started climbing. Was there ever a lot of climbing today! That was "very" rolling hills! I got to play the cow game for a while as I was in cow country for half of my day. At some point on highway 1 was signed a detour as the road was completely closed. I thought oh-oh, this is a bad deal. So I went through the backroads. Was it ever so pretty! Hilly, but pretty! I ended up in Tomales, cute little town, almost a ghost town, and found myself sitting with the bees with a coffee and a cream cheese pastry. Yummy! I talked with this woman cyclist and got some recomendations about what to do in San Francisco. Apparently Tomales is a destination chosen by many cyclists training or gone for a ride as I saw many. Past Tomales, I reached the waterfront again, and found myself on the shores of a bay, Tomales Bay, where the great white sharks breed I've been told!    On the other side I could see Point Reye, a giant national park that I wanted to visit. Then I entered Point Reyes Station the little town before entering the national park. I really liked it with its little shops, all on one street. I stopped at the library and managed half an hour of e-mail business and then went for groceries. The nice part was that this grocery store was really geared towards campers as they had a nice section of dehydrated food, and lots of take out too. I bought supply for cheese fondue and chocolate for dessert. I decided I would stay 2 days at Samuel Taylor State Park and I would camp at the hiker-biker campsite overlooking the Golden Gate Bridge the night after. I was glad I had plans for myself around San Francisco. The Samuel Taylor State Park is like an oasis into the desert. As hot as it could be today (was it ever) I climbed a steep and hot hill, then down the hill and once I entered the park, shade sneaked in like magic, and the big Redwood trees took their place like if they were there for a long time. It was very bizarre, but delightful to have a break from the sunshine. Amazing California! I had a wonderful shower after pitching the tent, and planned my days to come, especially tomorrow. I wanted to go back to Point Reyes and visit that park a bit. I was particularily interrested in the San Andreas fault and to see the lighthouse which seemed to be spectacular. The same 2 guys from last night showed up at the campsite, and this time I kind of ignored them a bit, as they had been kind of rude with me yesterday. They seemed to be a bit more friendly today, but still. I retired in the tent early, and with my headlamp and flashlight managed to cross-stitch a bit and then un-stitch as I made a mistake. It was a typical Friday night at the campsite, lots of noise, lots of noisy kids running around, some people listening to the baseball broadcast on the radio. I want my quiet campsite back!!!! "I am so happy that I am doing this trip! It's an awesome trip!" Those were the words I read in my journal entry for that day. So it was....
By 0900 or 0930 I was on the road. My goal today was to reach the Point Reyes Lighthouse. I first stopped at the visitor center, which was absolutely great. I saw a seismograph, reminding me I was standing on the San Andreas fault line and I was in earthquake country. It was pretty quiet on the paper, no earthquake in the last hours... I took a little self guided trail called the earthquake trail, and saw the fault line being demarcated. That was very interesting. By 1030, it was already hot, so hot and the climbing I did didn't help at all. I found out that the lighthouse was 21 miles away, so I was in for more than a Sunday ride. I also had to climb a mountain range before reaching the coast. Oh well, this is what it's all about! I'm doing a bike trip! The first hill up and over the mountain gave me a good sweat, as the heat and lack of wind accompanied me on the uphill. Then I got into farm lands. The trees diseappeared and cattle fields were all over. The historic farms, established in the mid-1800's are named by letters. "G" farm was the first one, all the way to the "A" farm which was the closest to the coast. The farms are still fully functionnal and I must have seen thousands of cows that day. The land is bare. Grass, more than brown. I don't know how the cows eat enough, as there is not much on the ground, really.  I reached Point Reyes Lighthouse with effort as there were not many flat spots and sometimes switch backs to go up a steep hill.The wind was a bit of a problem at the end as I cycled on top of a crest and the strong cross-wind was pushing me onto the road. Fortunately the drivers were all good and passed me when safe and waited otherwise. The lighthouse was down the cliff a bit so I had to go down around 300 steps, equivalent to 30 floors building. The going back up got hard on the thighs after all that cycling but I won't complain about that one.          The way back home I was told would be piece of cake as I would go downhill, but I knew too well that I would fight a head wind. It was challenging all right, for the time I had the headwind. But I stopped close to a farm, watching a bunch of birdwatchers out with their zoom lenses watching... what were they watching??? I couldn't see any birds? Well after asking, I found out they were watching a mama cow that had just given birth to a baby cow! I stopped too and had it all figured out: that fenced section which was rather small had only a few cows, say 5 or 6 and at least 4 of them were very pregnant. 3 of them were in labor and one had just given birth. Wow! A maternity ward for cows! No midwives for cows, but a couple of cheerleaders encouraging the poor cow trying to push and quite a few curious getting quite impatient to see the show. I think it bothered the poor cow. Or else she was getting quite tired and decided to rest for a while. In the meantime, another pregnant cow that had broken her waters was helping the mama cow licking off the little one- very interresting dynamic going on! The other cows not into the show, stayed away from the action and didn't mingle, munching away. When nothing went on for a while, I left and decided that, after all, I was off-duty and I didn't need to time the contractions neither decide whether I should alert the cowboy neither decide to prep for a cesarean section...(I am a maternity nurse in my real life). I headed back to Point Reyes Station and bought groceries and went back up the big hill under hot sun. At the campsite I found 2 new campers at the hiker-biker site. Two older gentlemen probably in their fifties. The first one talked like if he was drunk- I wasen't sure about him. The other one seemed like a real cyclist, having done few cross-countries by bike and having travelled places. We talked for a while and then I made my dinner, real gastronomy for me: chili with red kidney beans and cheese. Yummy! I added some couscous in it and ate the whole pot. I had yogourt for dessert and a rice krispies square too. I would be curious to know how many calories it totalled tonight and for the whole day. I think I eat like a pig, and kind of feel guilty about it. I understand that I need the calories  but... Anyways, I will go to bed now. It's getting "late" (8:30 PM)... 
Yesterday I said I saw thousands of cows... Well today I could say the same for cyclists... Sunday morning is for cyclists. Saying goodbye to the 2 old guys at the the campsite, I headed towards San Francisco, a little puzzled by the guide book that had 2 pages of directions just to get to San Fran!  Will I find my way? I was a bit worried but happy to leave the campground and head south. It felt like I was going uphill the whole day. My legs weren't so fresh from the previous days. I actually asked myself when was my last real day off, and it was 10 days ago.  Soon enough I was "in town". From Fairfax the cycling route takes me into a residential neighbourhood and through the suburbs. There were a lot of cyclists out, and lots of people to say hi to. It was quite early, and Sunday morning, and all those people out working out! I was quite impressed! My favorite place today, even if I count San Francisco was Sausalito where the cycle path takes us right in the heart of a nice yuppy type of place with cafes and shopping (nothing that I could afford) and with a nice view of the Bay. It was sunny, and lots of people out. I would have liked to stop and sit there for a while but didn't feel comfortable as I felt I didn't fit in with my helmet, panniers and chain tattos on my legs. I was planning to set up camp early and go to San Francisco that afternoon so I didn't delay. Out of Sausalito was... uphill, and by chance I found myself at the Marine Headland Visitor Centor where I needed to register for my free campsite. I had a brief look of the Golden Gate Bridge but alas, fogged in. The campsite too was fogged in to my big disappointment because I chose to camp there just for the view it offered on the Golden Gate Bridge. The campsite was really not what I expected. Well it was free, but... there are limits! The only 2 sites were into a valley, almost enclosed. An outhouse laid there, at sight, but the smell that came out of it was the worst: because of the enclosed valley, the odor was coming out and staying within the campground which would bring waves of nausea... I wasen't so happy about that. Then, there was no running water. I knew that already, so I filled up at the visitor center but if I needed more water I would need to go down a steep hill and then back up (worth 1 km). "Only one night here" I promised myself... Tent set up, I geared up to go to town, and briefly waved my neighbors goodbye. They were 2 men, maybe one father and grown son but it was hard to tell, and they made sure to warn me about some very aggressive racoons, a skunk and even a mountain lion that they saw last night. I got the message and went hanging my food in the trees using the clothesline technique, all that at a respectable distance from camp. That done, I slowly made my way to San Francisco... Those hills! My muscles were aching... Before entering town I spent time at the Golden Gate bridge viewpoint, drinking a well deserved Pepsi and hoping that the fog would dissipate a bit more. Lots of tourists here. Riding on the bridge was a bit tricky with all the pedestrians on it and there were wind gusts pushing me on to the side and I had to weave my way around the tourists... Not much time to look around and admire the view. In San Francisco, I randomly rode around but heading towards Fisherman's Wharf. I was too tired to follow indications on my guide book and they were pretty vague anyways. I found myself following another cyclist or following some bike path sign that would be meaningless for me but I was on a bike lane anyways, so who cared?      I eventually made it to Fisherman's Wharf but felt lost, alone and aimless walking on the busy sidewalk and trying to make room for my bike. I bought some grapes to eat and some pop corn as a treat, and headed back to camp..  Crowds weren't my thing, especially after so many days in solitude. The way back was complicated with a strong head wind and the bridge was even worse with the strong gusts trying to push me off my bike. Fortunately there weren't as many pedestrians. Past the bridge I decided to return to camp in a different way, the "scenic" route. Geeez, with that fog, I couldn't see ahead of me for more than 25 feet. The hills were steep- uh.. deadly- tiring and left me out of breath. And when I got to the downhill, it was so steep again that I had a thought for my breaks, hoping they would hold!!! My hands were grabbing them and squeezing them as much as I could and yet was still going down faster than I wished for. What an adventure!  Alone in camp and cold, I made myself some dinner, than dessert and got to wash my dishes- with minimal water- Just the regular evening stuff. I went quickly in my tent that night. My thoughts were to head out of town in the morning, as soon as I could, and go back to the peace of the ocean, and nice campgrounds with shower... My last comment in my journal reads as is: today I was telling this group of older adults about my trip as they asked. I talked about where I was from, where I left and where I was going. I could really see how impressed they were but I could really feel as well how proud I was of myself. I wanted to remember that moment, and to record it somewhere, so I can have easy access to it when  times would get tough.
I eventually fell asleep again to wake up by 0600 with a noise on the back of my tent, like an animal that touched the fly as it was running. (I had ear plugs in) I sat up straight, took off my ear plugs and listened for more noise but it didn't happen again. At 0620, now awake, decided to peek outside to see what the weather was like, and horror! there was a skunk roaming around... Closed the tent and chilled for a while... I didn't know what else to do! Half an hour later, I look again and it's still there. Oh, great! What now???  Then my neighbor got out of his tent to take a pee and I warned him of the skunk. He saw it once I told him and we agreed that we would not piss her off this morning. I found that she was having quite a round back, and sure hoping she would not spray. 15 minutes later, I decided to be brave and came out of my tent. No sightings of the terror, good. I had a peek on my panniers, from a distance and they were still hanging, good. I would have breakfast! When I got brave enough to go get them, to my surprise, the thiefs stole all my pasta, the garlic and my apple! Geeez! My panniers are dirty and I feel cheated. I packed, ate and left. What a start of the day! Leaving Marin Headlands Park, just out of the tunnel and towards Golden Gate Bridge, bad news. Flat tire. I was bummed out with this one. The tube changing went well for this one but I found a big slash on my tire. I put some good old duct tape in the inside but I thought I would need another tire to get me through the rest of my trip. I tried to pass on the west side of the Golden Gate bridge to avoid the walking tourists on the east but on week days, that section is closed and we are being redirected onto the east side. I had to climb another big hill to do so, back to where I was. Finding my way through San Francisco following the book was easier than expected but still sort of slow as I had to read the directions. I ended up in a residential area and stocked up in food at a grocery store. I saw very few people on the streets- I guess that all the missing ones are trying to pay their very expensive mortgage. Reaching the coast again I crossed the Golden Gate park and saw few surfers braving the very foggy, dreary weather and trying their luck with the waves. Only then I could relax a bit, with the sight of the ocean and the sound of the waves crashing.  I was stopping often, tired and muscles aching. My left calf was having enough of all those steep hills. I wished there were some flat spots, just some of the time! Daly City offered me a rest as I posted few post cards and then I found a library. I must have sat there for a full hour and sent out a few e-mails. It felt good to keep in touch with the world and keep my whole trip in perspective after such a rough night. Part of me didn't know what I was doing on the road. I was just bummed out, tired, dirty from the flat tire, and needed a shower, a massage, a haircut, a manicure, a pedicure and also have my eyebrows waxed... Help! It was 1430 when I reach Montara and went to check the hostel, just to see. My destination was a campsite 40 km down the road I guess but I was tired physically and mentally and I needed a rest. So I changed my mind and decided I would treat myself and get a real bed that night. However as the hostel opened its doors by 1630 I had 2 hours to kill in a not so warm overcast day. I headed in a marine park and read my e-mail that I printed, and then I headed for a cafe and ordered a big pot of tea that I sippped slowly with a lot of sugar in it and I read the paper.    Once checked in at the hostel, having listened to all the rules and locked my bike, I jumped in the shower which felt totally incredible. I shaved, shampooed, scrubed... And got to wear my street clothes for the second time in 4 weeks. The shirt is a bit beat without ironing but oh well. I got to do laundry which was overdue and wow! I am sleeping in a real bed tonight. What a delight.      I had a relaxing evening at the hostel. It might be the best location of all the hostels I've seen so far being a lighthouse and on the coast, you can go on the cliffs, and look at the spectacular scenery north, south and west. I went out for the sunset, sitting on the rocks, listening to the waves crashing and watching that big ball of fire falling in the ocean. I felt a bit nostalgic and lonesome but appreciated the solitude like an old buddy.    I had dinner accompanied by few hostellers, this Slovenian girl waiting for her job to start, this guy from Toronto asking about my trip, those 2 UK old guys on a Coast tour, and this young german couple on a car trip. I managed to cross-stitch a bit and then, very early, called it a day. 
It started by 0830: my regular time to leave. I woke up by 0530 in a real bed and never made it back to sleep. But that's ok. I slept well. Had a yummy breakfast, the same old thing, bagels with peanut butter and this time toasted, imagine that! I really enjoyed it. Ana, from Germany and her boyfriend gave me the same brand of peanut butter I have been using, the one with a Crispy Crunch in it as they didn't like it and the 2 old guys offered me a glass of orange juice that I gladly accepted. That was great! I did my chores that the hostel expect you to do in the morning (I swept the kitchen floor) and left. The cycling today was a bit monotonous. Lots and lots of fields of brussel sprouts. Met up with Brian, a  cyclist out for a day ride. We rode together for an hour, talking along the way. I was panting parts of it to keep up with him but that was ok because I like to challenge myself. That was nice to have company. At some point I lost control in the sand- beware of the sand as it makes it very slippery for the bike- and fell... However was that ever a nice fall!!!! Painless. There was a sand dune where I landed so I was really stunned to be unhurt! It's like falling into some powder snow.  The worst I had was some sand into my newly lube chain, but I took out most of it and didn't feel grinding at all. In the same section I saw some "sleeping" deers on the road side, with some blood coming out of their nose...Arrrgh...In the middle of the day I stopped in a pretty spooky corner store. The fruits were all covered with fruit flies, and I was looking for a bag of chips and one bag was opened and half eaten. The shelves were half empty and there were beef jerky left on the counter in the open, uncovered.  I was hungry and there was no other choice of store so I stuck with the safest: a Pepsi and some salty crunchy thing and left. Looking for a snack shop was difficult- brussel sprouts fields all over, the odd pumpkin patch, field all the way to the cliffs and no beach access. So I ate quickly on the road side, watching the cars and the semis passing by.I made it in Santa Cruz in good time and toured the pier and some of the shops.

Everything was close when I was there.I looked specifically for a stationnary as I needed to replace my journal that was full. I found this cute journal that would keep my deepest thoughts and who knows would travel with me to some other corner of the earth. Santa Cruz seems to have a lot of young people that don't know what to do with themselves, lots of tattoed and pierced people. I was glad to have my campsite out of town. After grocery shopping I reached the state park following my instinct-and got it right. (The map was not so detailed). I was worried of transcient people invading the hiker-biker as I saw one just out of the campground but it was not the case. To my surprise there were 2 cyclists at the campsite. Henk is a Dutch guy my age cycling from Alaska to Panama, and Ward is someone he met along the way, cycling from San Francisco to Carmel (Monterrey peninsula). They were really nice guys, and we had dinner together with me interrrupting to catch up a glimpse of the sunset. We spent the evening sitting on the pik nik table, laughing lots, writing our journal and post cards and sharing stories. It was quite refreshing to share with other cyclists.

I woke up at 0700, slept well. As I opened the tent door I noticed this person sleeping on the pik nik table across, on a blue tarp, and in a sleeping bag. That made me feel uneasy. First I thought about my food and second I was wondering whether my bike was still there. How's that for judgemental? I was being aware of that. Then I thought it could have been Ward, as he told me last night he didn't have a tent but just a thin bivouac. Maybe he got tired to be harrassed by the racoons? Well Ward was sleeping where he set up last night, so I felt uneasy. Yep, there were some homeless in the hiker-biker, exactly what I had been told for the south of California. Then she got up. That was a woman! Oh well I give up guessing what she was doing there, beyond trying to sleep. Today I rode with Henk. We actually got along well and riding at the same pace. He had quite the nice mountain bike with full suspension and disk breaks  and a BOB trailer, one of those thin trailers with one wheel in the back. We talked lots, each about our lives, we laughed, and had a good time. There were lots of fruits and vegetable fields around, brussel sprouts, cauliflower, cabbage, and I saw for the very first time how artichoke grow, and we saw so many strawberry fields! I wanted to stop and sit down and eat strawberries. They were ripe and the smell made my mouth water! Yummy. I had the urge to make strawberry jam... That's the part of me that want a country home, make bread, do canning, and make jam. Most of the route today was off the highway and well marked too for cyclists. Maybe a third of the distance was a separate cycling path which made the cycling care free. Henk and I stopped in a fruit stand for strawberries. They were so yummy! Not the ones you would get in Canada. Those that we ate were freshly picked.I ate them almost all at once. Then we stopped for e-mail in a very spanish town. We wanted to use the computers together but in this strip mall where the library was this lady from an adjacent business came out and warned us of not leaving the bikes alone, for safety reasons. So we took turns. I got mail and it really warmed my heart to read from all my friends and from people that cared about me. As I was waited for I wrote a short note and left for more cycling. The sun decided to show up by that time. Henk and I took some pictures of ourselves when we got near Monterrey and then went looking for Ward at Fisherman Wharf.        We didn't find him there but we decided to have a drink, and relax a bitand had a tour of the pier. Henk was invited at Ward's sister place farther than where I was going, so we carried on until my campsite and we parted with the trust that we'd meet farther down the coast.     Now, I've been told a lot of stories about Vets Memorial Park, about how this was a druggies place and how unsafe it was. So I spent a lot of time looking at the park rules, the map and I asked around if the campsite was safe. The park ranger assured me that it was. Still unsure, I went to the hiker-biker and looked around. There were few tents already there but no occupants as this was the afternoon still. One tent was canvas suggesting hippie like people. I pitched my tent and went in town, going down that big hill that was so hard to climb! First stop, the post office. I mailed myself a parcel including my gore-tex jacket, my cycling rain pants that I didn't use, my journal that was finished and few maps. 5 pounds worth! Second stop, the library. Then I went to Safeway, stocked up and reluctantly went back to camp. Well, there were quite a few cyclists there, 2 guys I met earlier in the day, one in recumbant. One older guy over 70 doing a circle around North America and a young 19 year old guy that learned to bike 2 months ago and now going from San Francisco to San Diego. Another guy was in the campsite, probably not a cyclist but he was playing flute while I was having dinner. Weird. Well, the lesson for me is not making too many assumptions about things. Few words about the 2 men, one in a recumbent. This guy was soooo excentric! Both were family men, doing a short 5 days trip. Mr recumbant doesn't like to travel at all but loves weird bikes. The first day of his bike trip he was wearing jeans. He got quite hot so that night at the campsite he made himself some shorts out of his jeans!!! :)  That night I had my favorite meal: ramen nooddles with carrots and corn and threw in this yummy yellow cheddar cheese... Yummy! Went to bed early. 
   I made it to Big Sur-Pfeiffer State Park by 1700, late for my liking and I met George, a cyclist that Henk met and cycled with for 2 weeks. George is cycling from Wisconsin, went on the Northern Tier to Florence, Oregon then is heading to Los Angeles and hopefully to Florida after that. Wow. We had a nice chat while I had dinner, discussed each other's plans and then darkness came in, so soon... Ryan (the 19 year old guy) is here too and we stood by a little pit fire before retiring into our respective quarters. There were no real spectacular sceneries today because of the clouds. Well it is spectacular but harder to see! I hope to sleep well tonight as tomorrow I will have a long day. 
     George and I met again for a snack shortly before noon and we had a hot dog, believe it or not, my first of the year! A very expensive one too. Oh well, I was hungry. After attacking 2 steep and long hills, the descent got exhilarating and very scenic.    I found myself on a very different terrain, rather flat with some very gentle rolling hills, but it seemed endless!!! I thought there would be only 10-15 km of that to go before the campsite but I think it was more than that. I was tired, I could feel the energy leaving my body. The book said to keep my eyes open for the Hearst Castle which could be seen from far away up in the hills and I could not see it at all and got me discouraged, until I reached the historic part of San Simeon where I bought myself some Pepsi and chips and sat down for a while until I got frozen (wasen't that warm). Then I went to the San Simeon visitor center where I booked a  tour for the next day as well as a ticket for the movie presented. I am actually looking forward to it, it seems promising. Tomorrow is my day off and I absolutely need to do laundry and hope to get on the internet if I can. I had some pasta with tomato sauce dinner again tonight (Debbie's recipe) and George shared his little bottle of wine with me and I shared my banana bread with frosting with him. That was a nice dinner. Then came Ed, that I met earlier today. He had been touring from Ohio (so he says) to the coast then down to San Diego. Then he got everything on his bike stolen when eating at a restaurant (panniers, sleeping bag, tent, everything) and had to buy everything again and headed back towards San Francisco again for a job opportunity but changed his mind again and is now returning to San Diego. He is quite a weird guy, not inspiring confidence to me. He is also quite unpleasant. Overweight, I wonder how he crossed the USA... He had a liter of milk and a bag of chips for dinner. It is not quite 8 PM yet and I am pretty tired, so will go to sleep soon. Good night 
       Wow, how impressive. Surrended by statues, lots of tiles, some white columns reminding me the greek architecture. Stunning. We weren't allowed to take any pictures with flash indoors AND outdoors as we were told that some peope have fell in the pool blinded by the flash- Duh! Then we went to visit one of the many guest house. Tapestry inside, nice carpets and ...wow! Then we went in the castle itself, passing by the main entrance, living room, dining room, game room, movie room. Very impressive architecture, accessories, tiles on the wall. Mr Hearst was a collector. He travelled in all those different countries and purchased those expensive and ancient pieces of art, statues, roof peices, carpets, tapestries, etc... Our last item to see was the indoor pool.     Very stunning. made of blue tiles and gold (24 carats) there was gold on the floor, walls, ceiling, and even the pool bottom. It was a big wow! I really enjoyed my visit. Back to camp, Henk was there!!!! So there was George, Henk and me. We had a nice dinner together, George gave me a piece of chicken. I made myself a vegetable soup with chicken and orzo. To my surprise, the orzo takes a little while to cook, but oh well. I shared some white chocolate and macademia nut cookies for dessert. Tomorrow I get to cycle again! :) I have to cycle with all I ate today. It was way too much! Will go to bed and get my shoes off as they are wet... Good night 
     We carried on and headed towards San Luis Obispo. Again very good cycling. It was inland and it got quite hot. We found the hostel after spending time searching real good but it didn't open till 4:30 PM so we had 2 hours to kill. I still had lots of energy to spend  and went on a tour around town on my own. I found a young woman sitting on a front lawn with a parrot on her shoulder. Red-headed amazon, age 43 years old!!! We chatted for a while, and I remembered my little bird waiting for me back home.(Also an amazon parrot) Back at the hostel, I sat with George and Henk still waiting for the hostel to open and sunbathed a bit. I was amazed at my wonderful cyclist tan, nice brown legs and arms but very white hands where I wear my cycling gloves. I was very proud of them, even if it looked real weird. I am now a real cyclist! They wanted 18$ Us for the hostel, which is not so expensive if you think about it but real luxury for me travelling for 6 weeks. We had yet another nice dinner night; I had some pasta again, same recipe (leftovers) and Henk shared his falafel. That evening I reserved my hostel rooms for the rest of my trip, the last 5 nights. I would also book my return flight back to Vancouver. The countdown is on, and I am not sure I am very pleased abut that.
   After 130 something kilometers I made it to camp, Gaviota State Park. Very windy, small beach and helpless camp host ( I asked him whether there was some racoons around and he didn't know as HE sleeps in a luxurious RV) I am writing those words on the fishing wharf so typical of the Southern California, awaiting for the sunset so I can take a picture. Another cyclist showed up and we got acquainted. I was glad to have some company again tonight. He sounds quite friendly. I more week to go as I booked my flightback home. It will be Los Angeles to Vancouver, so I will have to arrange transportation back to LA.   
   We made it to Santa Barbara's outskirts in good time and spotted a bike shop quickly where I bought a new tube and got a free map of Santa Barbara and the surroundings. After eating a yummy sandwich Sam and I parted (to my relief) and I headed south, then east, looking for the library. I could tell I was going more and more south as people grew oranges and grapefruits in their backyards, the soil is a bit darker orange and the houses are getting a bit more luxurious. Santa Batbara is really friendly for cyclists with special bike lanes and paths all through the city. The Coast path took me through the university campus, right in the middle of it. There was about a thousand bikes parked there. Then I went around the airport and stopped to watch a plane land, passing couple of inches above my helmet and I hit the library. I worked on an e-mail for my friends and my time was up.    I searched for the fabric store, my next stop, and bent my rule and purchased fabric. I don't have a clue what I am gona do with it, but it felt so good to touch and squish it!!! (I know, I am an addict...)     The meandering through Santa Barbara (and the errands) took longer than expected and I ended up in a filthy rich neighbourhood, no store in view and actually more than starving, with no snacks, no M&M in my handlebar bag. My blood sugar was getting low, the bike slower and heavier.It's called bonking in cycling terms. Fortunately I had peanut butter and bagels, which I devoured until I reached a groceery store. This was a lesson to learn. Never run out of M&M's. The rich people houses were not seen from the road as the fences would be too high, or there would be brushes or big trees to hinder the view. The ones I saw were palace overlooking the ocean, well manicured yards with a lot of flower gardens. Big wow. I didn't take much pictures today. I thought that the panoramas were kind of the same all along and I would like some pictures of myself and nobody to take them. I reached the campsite by 1730 after groceries and splurging in a chocolate filled pie (yummy) I was tired at that time and did not expect to cover that much distance today. A swiss couple travelling by tandem was at the hiker-biker and we attempted a conversation but their english was quite restricted. I had cheese fondue for dinner with whiite wine. It was quite yummy! And then Sam showed up and now he announce that he is changing his itinary and wants to go to the border with me. Help!!!! I want my space!!!!! It is 7:45 PM and I am ready for bed... good night 
   The morning of cycling was going quite well until 10:30. I visitted the Channel Island visitor center, and out of there, on a bridge, pfffffft! Flat tire. Rear one. It was a bad day to have a flat tire, knowing that I had a long day. Oh well. I set the timer, changed the flat, and beep: 20 minutes. That is including putting all my stuff back on the rack and fiddling with the tire on the rim. Not bad! I couldn't manage to get enough air in the tire so looked for a gas station, to no avail, until I reached the outskirt of Oxnard. There, this guy in a Honda stopped right ahead of me and asked me where I was going, and where I came from and if I needed anything. I asked for the closest gas station for air, which he gave me directions for. I thanked him for that and headed my way but maybe 1 or 2 minutes after that my tire was totally flat. Angry and frustrated, I started to change the tube with the new spare I bought yesterday and the same guy showed up again with a hand pump (the foot type).I wasen't in a good mood but he happened to be very helpful so I was grateful for his help. He showed me a map of the area and showed me my way. Inflated my tire. Gave me his business card and told me he was working at L.A. Airport and could help me box my bike or find a box for me. Wow. He gave me 2 bananas and one apple and asked me if I had enough water. I couldn't believe that. What a nice person.  With an inflated tire (I like them like that) I left again, south, through Oxnaard, and Port Hueneme and followed the Pacific Coast cycling route signs. Left, right, straight, right, left... The signs weren't always there so I has to wonder whether I was in the right way. I past a naval base, a huge one and a missile test center, and then reached the coast again. It was quite hot, had forgotten to apply sunscreen and wouldn't do it now with greassy hands. The surroundings were just the same, and not the same. Some veggie and strawberry fields, some orange orchards, lemon too, and red pepper... The mountains were quite close to the shore past the naval base. Bare mountains with a bit of brush on it and very little beach, with some surfers apprearing at times when the surf was cooperating. Past that I found a bare campsite by the 101 and by the beach and stopped for a quick bite to eat as my energies were quite low. Malibu came, and stretched and stretched and stretched. The houses, and the castles by the ocean were mostly hidden. All I could see was the fences. I passed the time trying to decide which celebrity would make their home there. I would never find out. I didn't see anybody I knew. The traffic was quite heavy but thankfully the shoulder was quite wide in most places. After 110 km, I was quite tired but I had to remain alert in the traffic as getting closer to Santa Monica, the shoulder narrowed, and narrowed even more, and I had to watch for those cars not so well parked on the shoulder, and I had to watch for the crazy drivers. Fortunately, nothing bad happened and nobody honked at me. I went to the grocery store before entering Santa Monica and then got on the L.A. bike path, right in the middle of the beach, where so many people rollerblade, walk, run and bike all along L.A. I was way too tired to stop and take pictures and was dying to find the hostel, which I did without too many problem. Santa Monica Hostel is a big one. I am on the 4th floor in a 8 bed dorm and on the second level. I got my bike locked in, took all my stuff to my bedroom and had a lovely shower. I got to scrub my chain tattoos, put deodorant and got my street clothes on! After dinner I was meaning to do laundry but there was no soap as the soap dispenser is broken. I got to bed early, with the last thought on my journal for that day: I hope nobody in my dorm snores! 
       Back to the hostel I was exhausted! I went up to my dorm and just lay there. I think I am getting a virus or something. My nose was plugged last night and I have this headache too. My muscles ache.... Hum! I hope it will be better tomorrow. My roommate came with some laundry soap and gave me some so I can do some laundry. And I did. Yay! Clean clothes!!! It was getting quite smelly in my locker. I worked on my needlework while laundry was being processed and went for groceries afterwards. Not much really. Just the little life. I had Ramen noodles, corn, carrots and cheese for dinner. Really wanted to be alone for dinner but this older couple on a circle-the-globe tour invited me to their table and made me conversation. They weren't really listening to what I had to say, even though I was listening and commenting on what they had to say. I was relieved to finish eating and get out of table. I spent a quiet evening in front of the tv, cross-stitching and thinking. Will go to bed early again today. Tomorrow is a cycling day. Go south. Go girl!!! Go to the border... 
     Little action there, just the odd runner or walker. It took me just about an hour to reach the airport. I made a mental note for myself as I would take the same route on Monday to take my plane. I took my first break at Manhattan beach. I stopped and had a yummy apple. Another cyclist stopped and presented himself: John. He was nice. We chatted for a bit as he was waiting for his buddy. He was kind of impressed by my trip and I think he would have like to cycle a bit with me but once his buddy arrived, they turned around. As he is working at the airport, he gave me his phone number for me to phone if I had trouble boxing my bike. So sweet! We waived goodbye, me leaving south, them north, and soon found another library, and stopped for an hour as I was exhausted.    One hour there and when it got time to go, I went, slowly, but surely. I found my way after parallelling the Pacific Coast Highway for a while until someone directed me onto it. The worse stretch was just ahead, which is from Redondo Beach to Seal Beach.Reffineries, rough road, shoulderless road, industrial area, busy, full of semis, highways entrances and exits to deal with, I had it all. And survived to talk about it. In the middle of it, blue sky, and barely 2 clouds in front of me. I could see clearly a cyclist out of the first cloud. And out of the second cloud, it was a heart! That was so weird. It made me smile. It made me happy. It gave me energy. I stopped at Seal Beach for Pepsi and Gatorade and visitted Huntington and Newport Beach (briefly). I felt sorry of not taking so many pictures as I didn't have much inspiration. I tend to take the same pier and beach pictures, boring! At Newport Beach I made a detour to Balboa Island and really liked the place. Little shops waiting for tourists, restaurants, nice atmosphere, really. I took a ferry back to the mainland, for 65 cents. I was a bit sorry not to stop and visit more as it was getting late. Laguna beach was quite pretty too. By that time, rush hour had started and it was time to push a bit. I had a tailwind which was quite nice and there were some rolling hills to keep me occupied. I stopped for groceries before getting in the hostel in San Clemente and bought some goodies. I needed energy, after that long of a day! Ate the rice and bean meal I had in my bags for a few weeks. It was quite yucky. The hostel was not really what I had expected. It was a small house with much less divisions, and for a good hour there was only me there! They were doing some painting job which closed one of the dorm so the room left was co-ed which I wasen't very impressed about. But oh well. I am only here for sleeping... That was why I was only paying 13$ I presume... 
   Then past the camp, the cities started again, one after the other one: Oceanside, where I got some Pepsi, Carlsbad, Leucadia, Encinitas, etc... I got a flat tire just about there, I was tired and took that one personnally. I thought I would not be able to finish this trip if I carried on having flat tires. I wanted to cry. I changed the flat and half a block down the road, I found a bike shop. I almost cried when I told the woman that sold me yet another tube how thankful I was for all the people that helped me or encouraged me along the way. I saw a bird store and stopped and waited for half an hour for it to open so I could go see the parrots inside. I sure could hear a whole array of sounds in there... Then when I came in, they all got silent little angels sitting pretty on their perch! There were nice birds and I had a thought for my own parrot, missing him but also apprehending the greeting as he usually bites when I come back from a trip. Continuing south I met a couple of real nice people that rode with me and that encouraged me and that were impressed by my trip. Yeah, I was just about there! Courage! I saw the beach and had a thought about riding along the shoreline all the way from Vancouver and yet never swim in it!!! Oh well. The ocean was beautiful, the coast georgious as usual and surfers ever present, maybe more today than any other day. After the big hill I had been warned about by day riders, I got tired.     I must say that the hill itself was a piece of cake, really. 1 mile long, the shoulder was wide and the climbing was going well and I had to laugh as I read grafitis on the pavement like "my butt hurts!"  Down that big hill I was in San Diego- so I thought- well maybe the suburbs. It got endless, there were lots of indications to follow and I was so tired! The beaches were very pretty and I don't think I took any picture and felt bad about that. This would have been the day not to be alone. I would have liked company. I took a long break in La Jolla and almost watched an outdoors wedding ceremony but felt out of place and so I carried on. I watched the surfers having fun with the waves. A cop in a 4x4 all terrain thingy drove by me and asked me about my trip and noticed how tired I was and gave me encouragenments. I lost my way in san Diego. I found myself in Point Loma instead of downtown where my hostel was. Then this cop in a car stopped right by me and asked from his driver seat whether I was cycling with panniers and a big load just for fun or I was really touring. I almost started crying. No, I'm not just doing this for fun, I'm trying to finish my trip. Geeez!!!!! Well, he explained that a month ago he was just back from a cross country himself, from Washington to Maine, and he was curious about where I've been. He waived goodbye and said "Congratulations! You did it!" That left me quite stunned. I can't believe it just yet. I made it to San Diego, I don't know how. My brain was in no mode to function, my body was in auto mode. The hostel was soon at my feet and a little later, I was in the shower. Funny enough, I wasen't so hungry. I took a walk to the train station to enquire about the train schedule tomorrow. I came back with groceries and had dinner. An australian woman warned me that there was some bed bugs and fleas in the dorms, so be careful. I didn't care.  All I wanted was to sleep...   
   No time to get emotionnal, but I was a bit, I had to watch my bike, and the cars, and the road, and the traffic lights, and the pedestrians. I ended up in a bus and taxi terminal, and saw the gate, where I could read "Mexico". I got some shivers in my back but tried to remained composed, and asked a lady to take a picture of me.       I didn't think that it would turn out well because she was moving when pressing the button. I made her take another one and she did the same thing. Oh well. I smiled and thanked her profusely. I will remember the moment in my heart. Victory. Relief. Fatigue. Joy. The emotions were buffered a bit by what I had to do next, find the trolley and head back to San Diego, and from there take the train to L.A. , then think about boxing my bike, all that kind of stuff. There were a couple of steps, big ones, to board the trolley and I was very thankful to get some help from someone from the crowd. 2$ to head back in San Diego, that was a bargain. It took me right at the train station, Santa Fe where I purchased my train ticket. Then I had 2 hours to kill, so I thought I'd go cycling in town and take pictures. Wrong!!!After cycling 2 km around the harbor towards the airport, I was so tired!!! I just sat there, watching the anchored sailboats rocking to the rythm of the ocean.      I ate my tortilla chips and just waited, taking a sunbath with a twist (cyclist tan). This guy, older, pulled in and parked his van and started mounting a recumbant bike, and carefully attaching all the parts that go with it. Well, he explained that today was the beginning of his journey from San Diego to New Orleans, the Southern Tier and his wife would drive the van day after day after day... How impressive! He congratulated me for my achievement, a couple of times and still I don't realize what I have done. Awaiting for the train at the station, this older guy insisted to buy me a drink when he learned about the completion of my trip. I was kind of embarrassed but oh well. The train was the type I would walk in with my bike and lock it up in the same car I was in. That was a nice trip. I could see the coast, the one I saw in the last couple of days, the surfers, the sun worshipers, the cyclists... I could say: Hey, I've been there!!!  A nice feeling. 1830 "Home" Santa Monica Hostel. It was a longer bike ride from the train station to the hostel than I thought. Not a piece of cake. But I did it. What a day! The train ride went smoothly. But getting out of the train was hectic as I had to reload my bike and as I had to find my way through L.A, Geez! I just didn't know!  Fortunately it was Sunday, so no rush hour. I started on the infamous Sunset boulevard but wanted to get on the Santa Monica Boulevard which would lead me just couple of blocks away from my hostel. Then this angel dropped from the sky in the form of a cyclist who suggested me a beter way, through Wilshire boulevard. He told me that my hostel was 15 miles away! I didn't expect that. But did I have any choice? I was stressed out because it was getting late, and I had to make it before dark. So I pushed it a bit. Cars were very good with me. It was a busy boulevard. Then I got into Beverly Hills. There was some action on Rodeo Drive, with cameras and a crowd gathering but I didn't stop to watch the commotion. When I got too tired I would sing, "I want it all" from Queen. That ws my trip motto. I got it all. I was so happy! After a fair amound of pedal strokes, I reached Santa Monica Boulevard, and I thought my brain was playing trick on my because there was two of them. I asked a driver at a red light, and he told me that one of them was going in downtown LA, and the other towards the ocean in Santa Monica. The one for me.It would be another 30 minutes of hard riding until I would recognize myself in Santa Monica and found my hostel. The sun was plunging in the ocean at that point too, so it was just about time! Was I ever starving. I checked in, got my bike locked up, took a shower and headed for the restaurant alley. It took me a while to decide but hunger took over and I treated myself with pizza, salad as appetizer and a glass of white zinfandel to celebrate my trip. I still have some pizza for lunch tomorrow which is goood news for me!  Tomorrow I will be home. Sort of. Late on Monday night, or Tuesday morning. I have yet to figure out how to box my bike. It costs me to remove my low riders (front rack) which was so hard to install.  But I have yet to find a box and also the right tools to remove the rack and the pedals. I'm better get early at this... Went to bed at 0930PM, way past my usual bed time :) 


Tomorrow morning, Feb 6, 2003, we leave Chico CA at 9:30am. We get driven to SFO by our good friend Tim in the SuperSonicSubaru. Our flight to Auckland begins with a quick hop from SFO to LA at 3:30 and if all is well we will leave LA at 6:30pm for Auckland. Somehow we will arrive in Auckland after 12 hours of flying and it will magically be 5:50am (you just KNOW that's gonna be UGLY!) on a SATURDAY! We get Saturday and Sunday to get acclimated, and then we will begin the OFFICIAL tour on Monday morning, New Zealand time. So... between now (7:30pm) and tomorrow morning we only have a few things to get done. The S&S coupled tandem (the infamous Flying Bilenky) is packed as are our clothing, camping gear and cooking gear. What still remains: prune a few trees in the yard, one final load of laundry, pack my personal toiletries, fill our carry-on bags with the right selection of food, books and magazines, go to the copy store and copy all our important documents as well as a bunch of pages from the "New Zealand by Bike" book loaned to us by our good friend Jeff Smith, oh and did I mention, close on the refinance on our house??? You think I'm joking but I'm not... Could be a long night. I hope the notary gets here soon!  We will try to give you an update in the next few days before the tour starts, we'll see how hard it is to find an internet cafe...  Keep on checking back!
What Day Is It, Anyway??? Well, we got everything packed, stuffed, tossed or put back, as best we could on Weds night (LATE Weds night!) adn Thurs morning. Friend Tim waited patiently for us to be ready, finally, to leave, helping us to load the Subaru with our 4 bonus-size bags (Mike's gear, Janine's gear, camp gear and the bike) and us... a quick last stop at Peets for coffee and we are off! At 10:45am we are only an hour and 15 minutes late, not too bad (luckily we left some slack in the schedule!). Three hours' uneventful driving to SFO, where the usual level of chaos was going on... about17 government vehicles with assorted lights flashing at one end of the airport (welcoming a big government official from China, rumor has it) and a whole platoon of cop cars (just like on TV!) at the other - apparently tending to a little old lady who 'ran through the security area', luckily flying with UNITED and not American with us! The United check-in line was the longest I've ever seen, which is saying something in the post 9/11 era. An uneventful flight to LA and we start in on a 4 hour layover with the hottest chinese food I've ever been exposed to. I want to eat... but I can't, it hurts too much! Even Mike thinks it's hot. After dinner, we still have 3 more hours, and battle fatigue starts to set in for me (Mike got alot more sleep than I did in the last few nights!) so I resort to the first of several 'caffeine injections' that help me make it through the next 24 hours! Finally it is time to board our plane... a 767 that holds 335 people and there are NO empty seats. Now we are REALLY wishing we had been able to get Business Class! Sorry, none available for 'frequent flyer miles'. So we are stuck in the 'cattle car'... But not complaining, too much!  The flight lasts through 3 meals, 3 movies and 12 hours... and at 6AM we land in Auckland literally moments before sunrise. That was One Long Night! Disappointing that we don't get to see a 'from the air' preview of the land we're going to get to cycle. But we'll get the chance to see New Zealand from the air later, no point in dwelling on it!  Customs, immigration and Ag inspection are never to be taken lightly so we behave ourselves (does anyone NOT think of Midnight Express wihte they're standing in the customs line??) and emerge without incident, and with all the luggage seemingly intact. The Bilenky, in an apparent bid for freedom, has punched a crankarm through the soft-side carry case but all seems to be ok. We arrive at the Manukau Holiday Park (that's Kiwi for Campground) at 8AM. Weather is downright balmy and the scenery is kind of 'sub-tropical'... we'll add some photos to show you, when we figure out how! The day goes by in a sleep-deprived blur but we definitely did do the following: make camp, pitch tent, put together the bike, buy lunch, visit grocery store and two local bike shops, make dinner. I collapse into the tent at 7:30PM to avoid the embarrassment of falling asleep with my face in my dinner! Mike joins me at some point after visiting with old friends from past trips (more on them later!) and we don't emerge until 7am! What a great sleep. 
The roads are pretty quiet on a beautiful Sunday morning as our ride takes us out of town to the south, then east into the hills and out of the traffic altogether. After quite a few rolling hills, we arrive at our destination - Hanua Falls, a local park with a gorgeous waterfall. Very unspoiled, once you leave the parking lot, there are no signs, no paved walkways, no litter... nothing at all made or thrown away by humans. Just nature. Really nice!  After the requisite photo session and gawking, we get back on the bikes and head back for 'home'. We make a loop with a slightly longer route back home. We see alot of cyclists (and cars with mtn bikes) enjoying their Sunday rides. Everyone is pretty friendly, and the cars seem to give us plenty of berth. We hit a dairy (a.k.a mini-mart) and a bakery after we come out of the hills, about 10 miles from camp for lunch (very appreciated after a breakfast of two scones!). The big score is the apple-cream turnover Mike and I split for dessert - divine! And, pretty cheap, too. We are going to eat well on this trip! We hang around the campsite for the rest of the afternoon and evening, reveling in the joy of 'no obligations'... no chores to be done, no tasks more pressing than oiling the chain (Mike) and deciding whether to cook or have Chinese take-out for dinner (Janine). This is a good chance to tell you a bit about NZ campgrounds... We had heard that they are a real step up from what we're used to in the USA, and we weren't mislead. Each campground (or Holiday Park) has a kitchen/common room where you can cook and hang out. This one has 3 stovetops, 4 sinks, 3 refrigerators, 2 big tables and a big 'free bin' wher you can put or take books, magazines, cooking and camping items, spices and food. There's even a TV ;-)  It has really nice, clean showers and bathrooms... plenty of picnic tables, trees for shade, stores nearby too! Wayne says that in NZ the Holiday Parks are where the poor live... not sure about that but it's definitely where you can vacation luxuriously on-the-cheap! Oh, and when it rains, you can upgrade from camping to a 'camp-cabin' for about $5 US... it's a cyclist's heaven! Everyone is super-friendly and helpful too. They think WE have the accents! Kind of funny... We can understand them mostly, when they don't talk too fast. They have alot of slang we're not familiar with, so that can be funny, too.  We wrapped up the day with Wayne's traditional welcome speech outlining the details of daily life on the road, more on that later. Can't wait! We also got our maps, with ther route marked... made it seem really real at last!  Oh, Mike wanted me to mention that the biggest challenge of riding is getting used to being on the WRONG side of the ROAD!!!  It's more than alittle disturbing... especially when descending a narrow twisty road with out a painted cneterline... or negotiating a roundabout, circling clockwise... or makeing a right turn off a busy road into the campground!  All of which we did survive... we only once got back on the road and automatically went to the right side of the road, luckily saved by our new friend Thom's helpful reminder, "Hey, Wrong Side Of The Road!!!" Oops. Thanks Thom! Tomorrow, we have a "Tourist Day" , we will take the bus into downtown Auckland to see the sights. We are actually staying pretty near to the Airport, on the southern outskirts of Auckland. One member of our group is still 'at large', so this day gives them a chance to show up! Tomorrow I'll tell you about our travel companions, if I have room (I only have one page per day, maybe that's a good thing?)... Lots more to come!
Downtown Auckland (population 1.2 million) is a beautiful city! Mike and I both agree - we could live here, if we ever were to live in a city. Immaculately clean (even the alleys!), bright and busy. No Peets Coffee (yet!) but we indulge in a cup of Starbucks to get the adventure started. Wander the city on foot a bit (pretty hilly, like SF's pretty little sister), check out the amazing yachts in the harbor (they are HUGE!) including the America's Cup contestants, fantasize about life on board a  boad (Kirk and Pru, we're thinking of YOU!). We manage to accomplish everything except the visits to the museum and aquarium. It's OK though, because we'll be back here two more times before we leave.  This is a good chance to give you a quick overview of the trip - if you want to learn more about it, visit the organizer's website: www.waynesue.com!  We are doing a complete loop around the perimeter of the north island of New Zealand. The trip is divided into three segments: Auckland to Wellington (via the east side of the island), Wellington back to Auckland (via the west side of the island) and then a loop of the 'Northlands', the country north of Auckland, returning to Auckland one final time. The total distance is 2100 miles, in 51 days.  After that, Mike and I have 6 days in which we will fly down to the South Island, rent a CAR (!!!) and act like normal people on vacation!  We are pretty tired by the end of our tourist day but feeling like we are getting to know our travel companions. They are: Wayne and Sue, organizers extraordinaire, John and Sharon from New York (we met John last year on our Death Valley tour with Wayne and Sue), Bob from Washington I THINK, also familiar from the Death Valley tour, Allan from Chico (actually one of my yoga students!), Ed from Washington, Thom from Salt Lake City UT, Dan and June from Canada. Some are doing the whole tour and some only part, and others will be joining us for the third section only! You can find out alot about Wayne and Sue if you go to their website, www.waynesue.com, so I'm not going to give you a ton of details here... suffice it to say that they have lived the life that most of us only dream of. They travel adventurously for a good part of each year (whether its biking, hiking, kayaking or whatever!) and live lightly on the land.  John and Sharon are fellow 'escapees' from the American work ethic... much like Mike and I, they timed out (John first, Sharon second) in the last year or two. They live in New York City and love it there... but life keeps calling to them with adventures from all points of the globe. Are we lucky or what? In our 30's/40's/50's with few encumbrances and the freedom to do whatever we want... excess possessions are highly overrated relative to experiences!  Bob from Washington is a seasoned tourist, having pedalled many miles all over the world. He's the one to watch when scouting out the ideal cafe, vista point or tent-pitching spot! He just has 'that touch'... Allan, my friend/yoga student from Chico is our free-spirit. He's quite a world traveller but this is his first tour by bike. He's an ex-firefighter and is he STRONG! He rides a mountain bike, carrying this enormous backpack thing that weighs about 50 lbs, up hill and down. We don't know how he does it! Back home he's a bit of a 'gym rat' but out here he just has to settle with loading the bags out of the van for an upper body workout! Ed from Washington has done some trips with Wayne and Sue before... His wife had to work this time but apparently she is quite an active type as well (mountain climbing, anyone??). Ed's other hobby besides bike touring is refereeing soccer back at home. We like to tease him about his skinny legs... but it doesn't seem to stop him from climbing those hills! Thom from Salt Lake City is not a mormon (why is that the first question I always have to ask??). He's done a number of tours, too (mostly 1-2 week trips)... but none in the last few years. We think he's trying to make up for those years by piling on a million miles this year!  Finally, Dan and June are veteran riders. June has completed the Brevet training rides up to 300 miles in one day! And Dan has actually completed Paris Brest Paris twice! Now that is a glutton for punishment! They ride the Bike Fridays, folding bikes with small (20 inch?) wheels that each fit in a hard-shell suitcase. Pretty handy! So, that's our crew. We got to visit quite a bit today (every time we turned around we ran into one another... didn't think Auckland was that small!). We accomplished alot, today, too... we have cash for Wayne and Sue, new tires (or tyres, in Kiwi-talk!) for John to replace the ones he left in NY, a full set of maps and smiles on our faces. After dinner I rally and head to the nearest internet access - McCafe at a McDonalds!!! - to enter a few pages into the journal. Back home to bed by 9:30PM. Hope you're enjoying our account!
We quickly leave the city and traffic behind (like, REALLY quickly - 10 minutes!) and find ourselves in gorgeous rolling terrain with hedgerows for fences and every sort of farm animal you can imagine. The country side is very lush (though they are saying that it's been a dry summer), and it's typical to see hughe 10 ft tall fern forests, next to palm trees next to pine trees, next to oak, poplar and birch. The only tree I haven't see here is a crepe myrtle! Dirk Burgon, you would think you had died and gone to heaven if you woke up one morning in New Zealand!  One of the really gorgeous sights was a grove of low-growing trees of some sort, literally covered with morning glories. Spectacular! Completely growing wild, out in the middle of nowhere. It also takes some adjusting to get used to seeing hydrangeas just growing wild as part of the roadside vegetation... it is a wildflower wonderland, and this is the end of summer! I can't imagine what it would be like in the spring... Michelle Watkins, you have to come here! Today we experience first-hand Bob's uncanny ability to 'ferret' out the best of the best good things (Martha Stewart has nothing on him!), when, a good solid 45 minutes into the ride, we go through a round about and make a right turn. Bob pulls up, hops off his bike and zips behind a hedge in the charming little town-let of Clevedon. We all follow, somewhat mystified, and find ourselves at a totally charming little cafe converted from an old house. We take over the back patio for lattes and hot chocolates. It MUST be time for a break, after all that cycling! Mike is totally amazed at this, but he's determined to be a tourist, so he goes along.  We hav lunch oday in a tiny town called Kawakawa (KaWHACKa-wa), where we first spot the ocean. Actually it's still a bay of some sort, and with the tide out we ride past miles of mudflats... but still pretty! And the ocean air is invigorating. The overcast burns off just in time for us to climb the only hill of much consequence for the day, right after lunch, climbing on a full stomach, YEAH! After that we get into a long series of really serious rollers - FUN riding! Words cannot do justice to the scenery... We pass many many small farms, and almost every farm house is a charming cottage with flowers of every sort running rampant. One place has a solid hedge of lavender that is 4 ft tall, 3 ft deep and must be 100 ft long - wow. Almost every house I find myself saying, "that's my fantasy house!" Mike and I have already started joking about selling everything and moving here (don't worry, we won't!).  The whole area reminds me of a warmer Point Reyes, with lots less people. If it were in the US, it would be overrun!   Later in the day, Bob strikes again. On the afternoon segment, there are two stores. One looks like a nice little market, and the other is awful - a Shell gas station with a mini-mart. Mike and I consider stopping at the first (I want to buy some chicken to cook a curry for dinner) but don't, and then sail on past the second. We hear from the rest of the gang that the first market didn't have much of anything in it... Bob, however, stops at the gas station and comes into camp with fresh corn, cauliflower, and a bunch of other really beautiful produce. Who'd have thought?  After Wayne salutes Bob's 'ferreting' ability, we all decide to christen him 'the Ferret' from here on out! The new rule of the road - when Bob stops, we stop! We don't want to miss a thing! We wind up the ride with a surprisingly long (seeming)15km stretch of dead flat road along the water till we arrive at the campground. THis area is apparently quite famous for birdwatching - it is a very big stop for many migratory birds! We don't see much as we cruise through... but we are ready to be done and don't stop.  We arrive at the campgrounds (Holiday Park), rumored to be the nicest campground of the trip. It is unbelievable. Like Disneyland for campers, it is that clean, manicured and cared for. It is an almost new facility and it really does have a hot spring - a backyard-sized pool with temp about 95 degrees F. It even has a huge shade awning over the whole thing! You really have to see it to believe it...  The bathrooms and kitchen have washcloths beside every sink so you can wipe down the sink after you finish - and everyone does! Amazing.  We all have an awesome dinner in the community kitchen (this is a rare place without a restaurant in walking distance). Cooking together really adds a different dimension to the experience... we're already planning to put together a 'potluck' where we each cook a dish and all share! 
Today's ridegoes like this: some more dead flat road next to the bay (kind of like marsh flats, not too pretty) for about 20 or so kms to the big town of Thames and then a spectacular 25 km stretch where the mountains close in on the bay. We just roll up and down, left and right, through the most wonderful "Pirates of the Caribbean" scenery: ocean on the left, far as we can see... sandy/rocky beaches... then big, mysterious trees, some with hanging roots and most with shaggy, mossy bark... and overhead, towering rocky cliffs. The road here and for the rest of the day is two-lande, each about 13 ft wide, and no shoulder. Some of the drivers are very considerate, but others RACE by at great speed, with utter disregard for blind curves and even visible on-coming traffic - nervewracking! But it' hard to remember to be terrified because the scenery is SO spectacular (watch for photos if we can figure out how to put them up here!).  There's a lunch break in this stretch, where we all regroup. We learn that some of the group has already hit a pub for beers, wine etc. I could NOT get on a bike after that! We know there is a pretty big set of hills still to come so Mike and I dine *lite* and then hit the road.  The beautiful rolling coastal road contines after lunch for a few brief miles til we hit the promised hills - two relatively short but quite steep little climbs! The first is about 800 feet, with a spectacular view of the ocean the whole way, and a beautiful, perfect natural harbor. The second, about 600 ft, is more inland and hotter. A few perilous descents (it's still alarming to be descending on the wrong side of the road, especially when a car comes around a corner unexpectedly!) and a few more kms of beautiful rolling terrain and we are here in Coromandel, a quaint, little old tourist town. We have just enough time to eat an ice cream and buy some veggies from a local produce stand and then Wayne arrives in the van and leads us to camp! On our list today is laundry, bike check and journal catchup. Wayne and Sue are leading a 1 hour hike up to a place called Castle Peak which sounds great - but we will probably pass. Mike wants to save his legs for tomorrow, and I feel like I've had enough sun for the day. They're saying we're due for some rain but I see no sign of it...right now the sun is BLAZING! It seems to get hottest, around 3pm each day. The humidity is also quite high but we're getting used to it! 
One of the things Mike and I noticed right away s that most everyone takes articluare care with their stuff here... most things aren't new but they're perfectly maintained. And best of all, we rarely see piles of junk in yards or on roadsides. There is a fair amount of litter along the road but it's small stuff like bottles and cans (Mike wants them to start a better recycling program right away!). We have yet to see a car or even an appliance on the side of the road - or even a dumpsite, for that matter! Today's ride takes us from Coromandel, immediately launching into a 4 mile or so climb, followed by a long series of rollers and one short, steep MONSTER grade - about 1/4 mile, we estimate 18-20% - into the 'lunch' stop where  Wayne and Sue switch. It's a short day and so a bit early for lunch. Mike and I have a quick snack and decide to proceed on - we can see the next hill we face from the stop. This hill turns out to be biggish, inland, hot and humid - but not too steep or hard. It's followed by another series of rollers (see a trend here???) into the town of Whitianga (say: Fid-e-anga). We're ready to eat now, and here we find a nice bakery and a chicken sandwich... and our first meat pie. We choose chicken to be on the safe side but worry needlessly. The meat pie rules!  It's a NZ tradition, they come in all sorts of wild flavors - sausage, mince, steak, pork, you name it). It's a generous serving for one, made fresh at the bakery and kept warm for us! About $1.50 US, it's a food bargain. Alot like a mini- chicken pot pie but with the most delicious flaky fresh pastry. Mmmm! We share a table with a nice guy from Minnesota(!) who has been here 7 times... he comes for the winter every year! He tells us about some more 'can't miss' things that we probably won't be able to squeeze in (THIS time!) but are interesting nonetheless. After lunch we take a ferry about 500 yards across the bay and continue to Hahei Beach, stopping first with the gang for coffee at a little cafe - high prices, mediocre coffee and a 'foofy' art gallery... but good company! And, since we never really started back riding after lunch, we didn't really even have to worry about stopping and starting! Mike and I saddle up and take off on the last stretch. The scenery continues to roll along, beautiful but we're having to work for it as the rollers continue. The campground is at the end of a steep downhill road (good to know that we'll get to enjoy it longer on the way out tomorrow!).  Wayne has already arrived and gotten our campsite... Allan is there too, apparently he just put the hammer down on the first big hill and we never saw him again! Animal! Gotta run, we're getting ready to take a hike along the beach to Cathedral Cove, a purportedly beautiful swim spot. Will tell you how it is, later! 
We made it an early night... today is rumored to be one of the hardest on the trip: not TOO long but LOTS of climbing: 3 major hills (each 2.5 miles or longer) and tons of rollers. Mike and I are a little more serious today: no unnecessary stops!   The terrain is like this: sharp, steep mountain-like hills descending right down to the ocean. Lots of rivers (say, every 5-to-10 miles there's another) and since we're following the coast relatively closely, each river means a big downhill, some rollers and a river crossing, and then eventually (or immediately!) another uphill. Then, just for variety, every once in awhile we keep on going up, way up, as the road cuts around a headland - then through more fields of cows, goats, sheep and flowers before plummeting back to sea level once more. After finishing the first two big climbs, we lunch in the little town of Whangamata (fangamata!) before facing up to the last big climb - and it turns out to be the toughest of the three (at least, our legs think so!). By now (we spent an hour at lunch, eating, buying groceries and visiting) it is the full-on heat of the day and when we get out of the cooling ocean breeze, it is HOT! And VERY humid. The sweat just pours off of us, especially Mike, and we really have to focus on drinking enough water to stay hydrated. We haven't been able to find gatorade, and 'sport' stuff like that seems quite expensive over here so we've started drinking these 'koolaid-like' packets (called sachets!) which mix up to a liter of any fruit-flavored Tang-like beverage you can imagine (Tangerine-mango, raspberry-lime...whatever!). In fact, we have gotten just about the whole group hooked on them! At about 20 cents US a packet - oh, I mean a SACHET! - it's a bargain!  We pick the brand with the most sodium and throw caution to the wind... life on the road is one big adventure.  Back to our climbing... and climbing... and climbing... and we finally reach the top, after countless false summits. Just after we begin a screaming descent, we barely spot the turn-off onto a smaller, quieter side road... beautiful! Goodbye logging trucks! Goodbye RVs! We own the road... for awhile! Some clouds even gather overhead to help give us some relief from the sun's baking (it's amazing how much color we've all gotten - already, after just 7 days!). The terrain is rolling but mostly down as we navigate the last few kms to camp.  When we get there, we find we're the first to arrive. Mike has been cultivating a hankering for some more of hat good NZ ice cream (Tip Top is the local brand, served by the scoop out of every dairy (minimart) we pass!) so we go off exploring. We find the ice cream - 2 huge scoops for $1.20 NZ (one scoop is $1.00, the second one is a no-brainer!) and Mike is happy. Lucky thing, too, since I spent our 'jersey money' on the grocerys at lunch and forgot to restock from the wallet! I had $1.80 left....  Whew! That was close! While we sit and eat, we visit with two young NZ families vacationing at Waihi Beach (each with 3 kids under the age of about 5, what pandemonium!). They want to know all about our trip and tell  us about their visits to the US and bike tours in Europe. Very nice people! The one guy wants to buy our bike after we finish the tour... we have to say no!  The hardest challenge is understanding them, especially when they speak quickly. It's embarrassing, considering that we're supposedly speaking the same language... funny! WE get back to the campsite, pitch tent and shower, cook dinner and eat - there's only one stove in this kitchen and we try to beat the rush. We end up trying the outdoor griddle ($1 for 30 minutes) to make tuna melts - yum! It's probably the richest dinner we've had since we started riding! We spend some time organizing and writing in the journal and then, after a nice romantic valentines day walk along the beach, we call it another successful day in paradise! 
Anyway, we hit the road and it is pretty muhc rollers all day. The route hits the main road, Hwy 2, after a few miles (good news is, there's another way out from the campsite so we don't have to climb the hill we went down yesterday!) and then it's pretty uneventful. It's either big rollers or small rollers... and a persistent strong headwind the entire way - sigh. Payback I guess, for all the tailwind we've had so far! The most noteworthy scenery is this interesting thing we started noticing yesterday. We've been getting into some wie country, somewhat like Napa but all hilly - no friendly vallye to cycle through! So the vinyards are planted up and down the sides of the hills and the view of them is quite beautiful from the roads - sometimes from above and sometimes from below.  Most vinyards seem quite well-established and here's the interesting part: they are all divided up very neatly into these small sections (maybe around 15'x60' to 25'x200'), separated by these spectacular hedges. Some are cypress, poplar, maybe even fir? Anyway, they grow these trees  in a very particular fashion such that they turn into these very solid hedges about 25' tall. They plant them very close together and then prune them quite severely so that they only get about 4' wide, and surround these wonderful old gnarly grapevines. When we see them from above on a hillside, it looks almost like an English maze hedge. It is visually arresting. Dirk, you would LOVE it! I didn't get a picture today, the traffic made us uninterested in stopping, but I am hoping to get another chance.  The closer we get to Tauranga (the 'real' city inland from the 'tourist' city we're staying at) the worse the traffic gets. Wayn had warned us that the navigation woudl be tricky so we are ready with our mantra "follow the signs to Mt Maunganui". That gets us through the freeway interchange, the expressway through town, over the harbor bridge, through a few treacherous roundabouts and into downtown Mt Maunganui where we finally get stumped and hit an "i" information center - 5 blocks from the campground! By the way, this place is amazing! The campground is quite large, and it is PACKED since our arrival coincides with a huge surf tournament (NZ, Australia and South Africa) AND a big triathlon, both tomorrow, but it is immaculately clean and tidy. Right next door is a 'hot pool' place where you can swim from 7am to 10pm in salt water pools heated a variety of temperatures... for $2.50NZ. Some of the pools are even shaded! Also 'next door' is the actual Mt Maunganui, which can be hiked to the summit in about an hour. We're saving that for tomorrow morning when it's cool.  We shower, set up camp and go exploring in town, about 3 blocks walk away. We find an awesome fish-fry take-away place where we just pig out, eating ourselves into a stupor again! Later this evening we plan to hit a movie.
After we hike down, Allan joins me for a quick dip in the ocean, body surfing is the BEST! The water temp is perfect, maybe 72 degrees. A quick shower and I am off to the internet place to catch up. Mike meets me here after watching the surf/lifeguarding contest and selflessly doing the laundry (is he great, girls, or what???) and now... off to dinner!  We need to check a few things on the bike and get organized for we ride tomorrow at dawn. Well... somewhat after dawn. But it sounds so good! Yoga buddies at North Rim - are you practicing???
The first 15 kms float by pretty easily as we tour the rows of fabulous beachhouses that line the coast. Then we get back on Hwy 2 for some more traffic-dodging... yikes! Some of our group (most, actually - all but Allan) take a side road called Old Coach Rd, which adds about 10 kms and a bunch of climbing. But, it got them out of the traffic! Mike and I opt for the more direct route, hoping to save alittle for tomorrow. The road rolls to Te Puke an dfrom there it gets into very flat, somewhat bleak farm country - drier out here and less tropical-looking. We have a slithg headwind again but its not too bad! After about 40 more kms we wander back to the ocean, where the scenery gets alot more tropical and dramatic again (boy are we getting spoiled!) and here we have lunch. Allan comes by and we flag him down to share lunch and the really nice, remote, rustic beach campground. Later we learn that Dan has a little low-speed incident involving the railroad tracks and the very rough gravel road leading into the campground - he is pretty sore for the next few days! Ouch! One more inland stretch where the land gets quite try and we fina a blueberry farm. We stop to check, even though the sign says 'frozen' only... I *love* blueberries! I'm telling the woman there how blueberries are my favorite fruit (no exaggeration!) and she says, "Wait a moment!" and grabs one last basket with a handful of berries from the fridge. "Here you go", she says as she pours the berries into my cupped hands, "These are the last"! Totally wonderful! Mike and I savor them (he says they're BETTER than US blueberries!) before hopping happily on the bike, energized for the last 15kms. The road into Whangatani is dead flat. As we get closer we pass this interesting jungle-gym-like-thing for adults (we took a photo), very cool! No signs, no people...just this big massive 'ropes course on steriods' with a climbing wall suspended in air, as well as tires on ropes, ladders, handholds and you name it. Adventurous! The closer we get to town, the more lush and green the scenery gets. It stays flat as we wander through town and finally find th campground approximately where it was supposed to be! No one's here yet so we decide to go downtown (starting a dangerous precedent, it turns out!), to get lunch and find the 'pro bike shop' located here. We drag Allan with us for more meat pies (steak and onion, and steak and pepper this time - Good!). Don't find the bike shop but we decide it's time to get back to the campground to make camp and shower.  After cleaning up, we head back downtown, on foot this time (it's only about 5 blocks) to exchange currency, grocery shop and search further for the bike shop. A bit of window shopping to round out the day and we are set. I'm predicting this sleepy little backwater town for 'next big thing' status - it is so charming! Ocean on one side of the main street, rocky cliffs straight up at least a couple hundred feet on the other - right in the middle of town - and flower beds and trees everywhere! It's only about 10,000 population but really nice. Probably my favorite city so far. The legend of the town's name (say: fo-ko-tani!) is that a Maori princess named Waikaka, in a boat full of women that was drifting out to sea, picked up the oar that was forbidden to women and paddled them all back to safety, saying "Te whakatane au i au" or, "I will act as a man". They made her a hero and there's even a statue of her downtown... No wonder I like this place!! Then we're off to 'home' to cook dinner (we almost succumbed tot he allure of chinese takeout but it was CLOSED on mondays!). The tiny kitchen is a bit of a madhouse as we all converge but dinner is still fun (Rogan Josh curry with steak, carrots and zuchini - mmm!). After cleanup, we all veg out by the tents where I find a little kitty to visit (turns out almost every camp will have one!)... I miss our little Miss Kitty and hope she is well! How is everything at home, Tim? As the sun starts to set (8pm), we all complain a bit about the cold as we all don jackets for the first time in days... it must be 60 degrees out! Loving it...
We continue on through some pretty awesome marshlands (lots of birds!) and into some pretty farm country. We stay inland pretty much the next 15-20kms then pop out again at the ocean, which is just the most awesome shade of turquoise blue... Mike is amazed by it so we got a photo! We pass the designated lunch stop at Opape Beach and it looks pretty deserted so we keep going until we find a nice spot by the side of the road for snacks. Then, we settle in for the majority of the day's climbing. My stomach is still churning a bit but I'm hanging in there! Mike wants me to tell you ab it about he roads (he probably notices them alot more, being in front!). Petty much all the roads here are 'chipseal' (or dirt!)which I guess is mad eby laying down tar and then throwing abunch of gravel on it. Eventually the cars driving over it packs the gravel into the tar for a relatively decent surface, but we are stuck out on the shourlder where it's either rough or rougher! Mike say NO WAY could you ride 23 tires over here. We've learned to categorize the surface by a couple of factors... how big the pieces of gravel are, and how long ago it was laid down.  Then where it's really hot, on the inside of the turns, the stuff even develops this special washboard effect - particularly fun on a downhill! The only other choice is to ride in the middle of the road! Yikes! Today we have several stretches of new chipseal, seems like always on a downhill. When a car passes, the gravel just FLIES everywhere - watch out! And, it's pretty exciting on a turn when you hit a big clump of gravel! Finally, witht he fenders, something completely new... the tires seem to pick up the gravel and throw it up into the fender where it rattles ferociously! Everytime, I think we've run over a big piece of sheet metal somehow - it makes a terrible noise! Back to our ride in progress: it just gets prettier and prettier as we go... really remote, isolated, undeveloped, beautiful countryside. The east cape is known for being a center of Maori culture and this area is predominantly populated by Maori. They have a very distinct culture of their own and yet seem much better integrated into the mainstream culture than many minorities are, back home in the states.  The last 25 kms or so of our ride is just wild unspoiled coastline - totally wonderful! We arrive in Te Kaha just as the van does, yay! The usual drill - showers, make camp and dinner. No errands to run tonight, no where to go at all, great to just be!
Somehow we miss the lunch stop again... we look for the van at Araoita but it turns out Sue went to get gas and since we don't see her, we just keep going, thinking we have plenty of food and there'll probably be a store ahead somehwere. The road turns inland and we have a series of shortish and not too steep climbs. The scenery is really pretty tropical and it's humid. The only real drawback is that there is alot of roadworkgoing on - at least 5 sections where they're putting down new chipseal (we even get to ride through a spot where they are actually laying it down, what a mess!) and one really exciting 1/4mile stretch uphill where they are completely revamping the road. Bulldozers and rollers and backhoes everywhere. When we arrive they are putting down the bottom layer of really coarse gravel and pretty wet dirt. The flagger waves us on like it's no big deal so we pick our way up the road, dodging the heavy machinery (don't think CalTrans would OK this move!)until, with the end right in sight, we get bogged down in a very muddy stretch and have to bail. We 'switch lanes' and make it through to the next stretch! Eventually we emerge at Hicks Bay (apparently some European first touched land here) where we are pretty desperate for fluids. 80 kms in the hot humidity on 3 bottles between us is not ideal! Luckily we had plenty of food though - that bike rack and pack has REALLY been a blessing. One more good stiff climb (about 600 ft) to a really panoramic vista and a wtisty technical descent to the campground. Yay! This place looks like it was probably pretty nice about 20-30 years ago, but has somehow fallen on harder times. The grass isn't mowed and the flower beds are all dead. The used to feature 'the eastern-most movie theater in NZ' in a little quonset hut but apparently the new owners didn't learn how to operate the vintage film projector! The hut and sign still stand as testimony to better times.  It's a nice quiet evening, we do laundyry and hang it out to dry. There are quite a few cyclists here including a really cool guy from Great Britainn named Kale - 30 years old and he has  been travelling the world for the last 5 years. He has been everywhere, it seems, especially in southeast asia: Australia, NZ (twice!), Thailand, Burma, Cambodia, Vietnam, laos, India, Nepal and lots more I can't even remember! He's been travelling on a mt bike with full suspension, pulling a BOB trailer and he is whip-thin. He tells us he is also a rockclimber and he looks it! Imagine travelling for 5 years! When he needs $$$ or seels a place he like, he finds a job for a few months - the travels on. Wow. He's meeting his parents here today or tomorrow (in a CAR!) and they are going to the south island for a few moths together. They sound pretty adventurous too, he says he gets it from them! What a life! REALLY looks like we'll get some rain tonight.
We're all siting in a little bit of shady lawn when a guy comes out from the building next door with two plates full of 'Rockmelon' slices (cantaloupe in the US) for us! Turns out he's from the local youth mission, and before we're done, he has brought us another plate of melon, 4 melons to take with us and a bag of tangerines as well! They're all fresh, grown in Gisborne (our destination for tomorrow ) and delicious. Yum! And just another example of Kiwi generosity. After lunch we haul ourselves back onto the bike for one more round of climbing. Shortly after, the headwind switches to a tailwind and things begin to look up! There's quite a bit of coimbing but it's separated by rollers that we manager to mostly float through (thanks much, tailwind!). We climb and climb and eventually, after countless false summits, we descend into Te Puia Springs, once a spa resort but now just another charming little town with a beautiful spring-fed lake. A quick stop to rest and recharge, and we are ready to tackle the last little climb. We get our first 'ocean sighting' and we are motivated! We don't resort to the little chainring but we feel sluggish slow... over the summit and it's a 9km screamer into Tokomaru. There isn't much here so we find the campground pretty quickly. It was a hard ride but we feel pretty good! Guess we're getting used to it. A quiet afternoon and we all walk down to a terrific pub on the beach with verandah seating, for dinner. It's about a mile walk each way, just enough to stretch our legs. When we get back, we find our friend Kale has arrived, with parents in tow! They're now off to their trek in the south island - maybe Mike and I will run into them there. A possibility of rain is threatening!
We start the day with a pretty good climb, right out of the gate.  Ouch! We go up and up and then down down donw to a pretty valley which we follow along with the river downhill to our 'lunch' stop at Tolaga Bay, about 35km into the day - alittle early for lunch! We have a tailwind for this stretch so the riding is about as good as it gets!  We have a quick snack and then wander on to Tolaga Bay's main attraction: it's 660 meter wharf built in 1929. Advertised as the longest wharf in the southern Hemisphere, sadly it fell on pretty hard times about 30 years after it was built. Ironically, the materials for the inland roads that replaced it were mostly shipped in via the wharf. It is pretty weather-worn but impressive nonetheless...  we are allowed to ride the bike right out to the end of it for photos! Then, we get back on teh bike for the real meat of the ride... up hill and down. Up hill and down. Roller roller flat, up haill and down. For most of the way we have a pleasant tailwind but we notice that clouds are starting to geater so we stay focused. We pass back and forth with Wayne in the van a few times as we com back to the sea once more... and the wind has cruelly turned on us! A few nasty little hills, fighting the wind and suffering. A great bike ride gone bad... ;-) But we make it.  Mikeand I are feeling better than in the last few days - our legs pretty strong and our butts are getting tough! Gisborne is a city of 40,000 - I'd compare it wht Chico though it seems a bit more touristy. We ride through the main drag on the way to the campsite which we find without incident, whew! Biy the time we get the tent pitched the clouds are REALLY closing in. We have a brief rainstorm and then the wind picks up and it is COLD!! I visit the grocery store for supplies (Pak and Save!) and then we have a quiet dinner. Now, we're all gathered in the kitchen (this time it's Dan and June, Thom, Ed, Bob, Mike and I) because its WAY too cold to be outside! Gee... it must be 55 degrees out!  We'll sleep well tonight with the cool air.
Today's ride is longish, with a big climb (508 meters) smack in the middle. It turns out to become one of those days when we just can't seem to get in sync - with each other (are wecranky because we're one day away from a rest day?), with the bike (ghost shifting is driving Mike nuts!), with the road (the promised 15 km downhill seems more up than down!) or with the weather (it never seems to get warm and we have our most persistent and strongest headwind to battle so far!). WE soldier on and manage to find some highlights in the day anyway...  a fabulous vista at the top of the hill, a steaming hot cocoa a tthe cold lunch stop after the freezing 'anti-descent', a huge flock of beautiful black swans (50 to 100 of them!) in the marsh and a herd of really neat-looking deer hanging out in a pasture. We've heard they have 'venison farms' here but this is the closest we've come to seeing one! The afternoon drags on as we face 40kms of flats with a pretty good headwind. We finally approach town only to face one more nasty littl eclimbi and descent right into town. Mike and I have a mission: to visit "the best bakery in NZ" - Ostlers, it's called. WE don't know when it closes but we're sure it will be soon! We arrive at 2:30 with 30 minutes to spare. We try out 3 more meat pies (scotch, sausage roll and steak and cheese, all great!) and a strudel. At 2:55 I go back for seconds, but alas - too late! Turns out in this town, 3:00 means 2:45, when it comes to closing time! We are glad we made it at all! After our repast, we tour the town (in case you haven't figured it out yet, that's a euphemism for 'getting lost while searching for the campground') for a few minutes and are ultimately able to find the campground without help. Tonights' lodging is another small place - quite a contrast to the rather institutional feel of last night's place - it's kind of like going to visit grandma's house!  It has little curtains under the sinks, plastic flower arrangements on the counters and a bowl of fresh lemons on this huge hardwood worktable set up in the middle of the kitchen. Martha Stewart would love this place! There's even a rug in the women's room, which is also charmingly decorated! The other interesting feature of this little town (population 6000?) is that it boasts 'the second biggest movie screen in NZ' - the biggest is apparently in Auckland. Unfortunately we can't get coordinated with showtimes so we don't go. It's only about 3 blocks from the campground, but... can't do everything! 
Miek and I finally shove off just before 9am, the first to leave camp, for the first time ever! John, Sharon and Ed leave with us but turn off immediately for a visit to the bakery which is surprisingly open on Sunday. We later learn that Wayne is chasing after them all morning, only to find that he was ahead of them the whole time! That's one way to get a focused workout! The day is an ongoing series of precipitous climb, shallow descent followed by shallow climb, thrilling descent. It is pretty neat to see the scenery change from arid to tropical back to arid on the east and west sides of each hill. We have a quiet lunch 'rendezvous' with Sue almost exactly at the half-way point and then tackle what's promised to be the more strenuous climbing in the afternoon.  It doesn't seem too bad, though, as we continue to roll up and down... waiting for the other shoe to drop.. We get to the town of Tutiro with its beautiful lake and famous swan colony and I start to wonder if maybe today won't be too bad, after all! We have a little climb out of the lake and 40 kms to go, and things are looking pretty good... Then suddenly we round a corner and are on a raging descent, going WAY too far down... we come around another corner and look up, up, up to the tiny toy cars on the tiny ribbon of road far above us on the next ridge.  I can't even figure out how we are going to GET there! But get there we do, and bravely we make our way up - thanking our small chainring again.  We stop near the top (but not near enough!) for a photo break before we turn away from the vista for good - wow! We get a nice long descent with only a few narrow, steep places where we really have to brake, and then 20kms or so of flat terrain into the city, passing wineries, vinyards, fruitstands and ocean views - nice! It's pretty dry here, and as we come into town it reminds me somewhat of Santa Cruz CA. Napier is considered a tourist town. It's claim to fame today is it's largely Art Deco architecture. Apparently the downtown was virtually destroyed by an earthquake in the 1930's and it was totally rebuilt in the art deco style. Hopefully tomorrow we will get a chance to see somje of it! Today, though, we are eager to find camp and get off the bike! On our way there, we see a bakery and of course we have to stop and re-fuel.  We get the usual pies and a goodie. It is SO good, in fact, that we decide to get a bag full for the rest of the gang before the bakery closes!  Laden with bakery bounty, we make our way to the campground. Everyone starts to trickle in and the evening turns into a sort of buffet meal, starting with goodies, then progressing to Sue's cheese bread from the morning's bakery stop and Sharon's, John's and Ed's wine from the Crab Farm Winery (a quick stop enroute to camp got them wine AND the story of the name: apparently the original crab place was uplifted 11 ft in the 1930's earthquake, changing it into the perfect location for a winery!)... and ending with tuna salad sandwiches which we all contributed to (think Stone Soup!) because no stores are open!
We got the laundry done and this ends the internet segment of the day... we're off to do some exploring! It's 1:30pm and there's a New Zealand movie called Whale Rider that we might try to catch at 3:45. It was filmed entirely along the coastline we just finished touring so there'll never be a better time to see it!  Later! Janine and Mike PS Many thanks to all who've written a note in the guest book, it's great to hear from you! We'll try to reply when we can but inet time is $$$ so we're trying to keep it to the minimum to do the journal. So even if you don't get a reply, know that we love hearing from you!
By morning, the sky is about half blue and half big grey clouds so we pack raincoats but stay hopeful. We head out at 9am into a pretty stiff headwind as we ride along the headland for 10 or so kms - disillusioning! Eventually, though, we turn inland and head towards North Havelock, a little town with an eerie resemblance to Saratoga in the SF bay area... vEry upscale small town, lots of hrses and lots of cafes. WE stop for a moment and immediately we are engaged in conversation with a very proper looking woman who wants to hear all the details of our trip!  After a little visit with her, we see Allan out of the corner of our eyes, sneaking ahead of us in a move that pretty much sets the pattern for the day... we exchange positions 5 more times before it's over! From North Havelock, we head down a small country road that just rolls along through the most beautiful, easy-riding countryside. WE have a lot ov milage to cover but if it stays like this it won't be bad! WE get alittle distracted as we head how an big hill towards (and past) a little pub, looking at the river we're about to cross and the hill we're going to have to climb up the other side on our left. So distracted, in fact, that we miss the subtly marked right turn we were SUPPOSED to make just before the pub!!! WE fly down the hill, cruise over the (really cool) bridge, and make the climb (fairly short but STEEP!), go down the other side and continue about 10kms until we come to an intersection that is definitely NOT on our route! Doh! We turn around, and almost immediately, run into Allan - again - as it seems he made the same error! The only good things about THIS little detour are: we don't make it ALL the way to the ocean before discovering our mistake, and we have a tailwind on the way back! We have about 25 kms to lunch, once we get back on the route, and it is a powerful stretch of road. We are flying! Downhillish mostly and with a tailwind... and the chipseal even seems smooth today! When we get to lunch we already have 90kms in so we know we are going to have a long day. The scenery after lunch is alittle less pretty... drier and alot less trees. Later in the day we do encounter some really weird red algae in this march/river/pond thing that goes on for close to a kilometer. We took a photo! We did also see our first official 'venison farm', didn't get a photo though. The deer are pretty cute and look pretty happy. Finally, we make it into camp, pretty tired... but alive! We almost rode a century today! This campground is a bit run-down but still charming in its own way. We are really 'out in the boonies'... pretty sure we are the only guests in the campground... but the owners are very friendly! After dinner (Indian masala curry with steak and veggies today!), the clouds really begin to gather... we all end up in the combo kitchen/tv room as th rain starts again. HOpefully it won't last all night or if it does, hopefully we'll be able to sleep through it tonight! 
Today's ride is a shortish one, though there are some hills, gravel road surfaces and rain threats to make it interesting.  The road is bordering on spectacular, scenery is fabulous. Even with dark clouds hovering overhead,  we are so mesmerized by the scenery that we just aren't interested in going all that hard.  Few towns today - the 'town' where we have our lunch break consists of a childcare center which luckily has a little gravel parking lot just big enough for the van!  The morning has most of the hills and a 2km stretch of recently graded gravel (or shingle as they call it here) road which is quite sinky and slidey - alittle scary!  Mike and I have ridden quite a bit of dirt on singles and on this tandem and we both agree this is some of the worst we've encountered on an actual road. The uphill is bad but the downhill is even worse! Everyone escapes the morning but not all arou unscathed... Alan ;manages to get lost again (another 17km mistake) and June has a little-slip-slide and fall on the gravel - but no big injuries, thankfully! The afternoon is a little easier riding than the morning. The road just flows along, even with a bit of a headwind! No big climbs and lots of gentle, rolling, winding and beautiful countryside.  The trees grow so big that they limit the amount of undergrowth prett effectively - whether in 'tree farms' (which are everywhere) or where the trees just grow on their own - underneath the trees it's almost parklike. We're also getting more and more close-up views of the local animal life... a baby pig on the side of the road this morning and a sheep loose on the road in the afternoon! We roll into our accommodations around 3pm. It's a special night tonight as we are staying at a 'backpackers' (like a youth hostel) that's on a working sheep ranch! We get a chance to see sheep close up  (you'll see the photos we took!), getting herded by dogs, getting sheared and hooves trimmed, and baby sheep getting wormed. This place is 22,000 acres, and has 11,000 sheep! Wow! The owner told Alan that the sheep get sheared twice (once per year) and then its 'off to the mutton shop'... except for the few they keep to breed. They told Thom that they have 45 rams to service 4500 females. Sounds like a big job, huh!?!?  They told Mike alittle about herding... apparently there are different dogs with different jobs... one to bark, one to chase and one with the 'evil eye'... no kidding... he just stares at the sheep and intimidates them (not that hard as it turns out!). Another great job! In addition to all this, we actually get REAL ROOMS with REAL BEDS tonight! What a treat not to have to pitch the tent etc! John and Sharon are having a bit of a crisis though, having vowed to see how many nights they can sleep outdoors! We're betting they'll stay in though, especially as it's raining again! Once more, we have all arrived before the heavens open and the rain begins!  In the kitchen (which is awesome, it even has a fireplace!!!), we all make dinner (I make a pot roast!!! and Mike and I eat a TON!) and then hang out. Wayne and Sue give us some highlights of the south island and then the talk turns to their next year's bike tour of the south island... I wanna go already! 
WE've been promised an easy day today. The forecast is for RAIN but we manage to make it through the morning without ever getting really wet. There are alot of clouds loooming but they're holding back. We start the morning with a good stiff climb and then descend into a pretty big valley. The scenery is probably pretty but it's hard to notice with the rain. Lots of rolling hills and beautiful trees, too. After a nice quick road-side lunch break with the van, we tackle the afternoon. and the afternoon mimics the morning... harder at the beginning and easier at the end. This time, though, it's a headwind making us work a bit at first but eventually it turns and gives us a helping hand towards town. As the afternoon progresses, we ride through another beautiful valley and then start a long series of rolling little climbs that we barely feel, with the help of the wind. Then we start down into Masterton. I'ts about a 1-2% downhill with the tailwind... and we're doing 45km/hour pretty much effortlessly!  We cruise on into Masterton and eventually find the campground (we stop to ask directions from a fruitstand and the guy speaks no english at ALL... we take his advice anyway and head in the completely wrong direction - CLASSIC!  Another cyclist gets us on the right road though and soon we find the campground.  This place isn't anything special, but it is a place to pitch the tent, and it's close to town (really close) and it's also located RIGHT next to the annual "Golden Shears" contest of sheep shearing for NZ and Australia, which just happens to be running this weekend. Of course we HAVE to stop in and see some of it... it is amazing how fast they are! Another thing we would not likely see at home in Chico!
It's raining harder as we get ready to leave so we all elect to stop off at the local bakery as we ride out of town. Wayne even gets a photo of Mike and I with our hands in the pastry bin! After coffee (Mike) and an apricot turnover (me_, we finally and tentatively set out. Today is promised to be a second 'relatively easy' day in a row - hard to believe - but it turns out to be pretyt darn fabulous! Even though the rain is looming, we can't help but revel in the glorious tailwind, the slight downhill, dry pavement and the fact that we're still dry!  We are now heavily into wine country. The terain is just gently rolling... pretty dry country but still with lots of trees overhead and lots and lots of cows and sheep in the fields. It's not ALL vinyards! For lunch, we stp in another charming little town going upscale. Martinborough is the first town we've seen with a traditional 'town square'. Apparently it is seeing a 'gentrification' from Wellington folks moving 'out'... there's alot more activity and a sense of affluence that we definitely haven't seen since we got to the east cape. After lunch, we head back out, thinking it can't get better than this morning. Fortunately, we are wrong!  We are headin gout to the coast, riding down a valley between a smallish set of hills immediately on our left and a pretty big range, the Rimutaka Range, in the distance on our right.  We'll be climbing the RImutaka Incline tomorrow so we're alittle curious to see what's in store. Right now, all that looks to be in store is some pretyt nasty weather! The clouds, especially on our right, but also on the left, are just BLACK and we can see the sheets of rain falling in the distance, as we fly along on the back of the wind.  10km before camp, we stop at a really nice little general store - our last retail opportunity for today!  Allan wanders in and we all hang out for an hour or so before the final stretch.  After we arrive in Lake Ferry, we have another frantic tent-pitch, racing the rain (we got rain half-way through pitching the tent yesterday!), which never really does show up. From the comfort of our campchairs, and with the sun glowing somewhat feebly on us, we watch the clouds on the Rimutaka get darker, bigger and increasingly more ominous as the afternoon turns into evening. Better not to think about what comes tomorrow, it'll be here soon enough! 
The wind blew all night and rain squalls came and went - nothing that sounded too serious though! We wake to more clouds and a hopefully somewhat quieter headwind. We take off with a sense that our charmed luck may finally have run out - everyone is carrying a full complement of rain gear! We have a choice of taking the possibly muddy Rimutaka Incline (an old railway-bed trail for bikers and hikers only) or the very busy Hwy 2 into Wellington... we don't have to decide until the lunch stop. Because of the headwind, most of us ride together back towards the Featherston lunch stop (about 45 kms total). Mike and I do our best to shield everyone from the wind, earning lots of appreciation along the way. John even serenades us with an extemporaneous song about the tandem, sung to the tune of Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer! He has a fine voice.  We don't go too fast but we have a godo time and eventually we arrive in Featherston! Wayne, driving the van, has time to do a little research and decides that we will be fine on the Incline trail, so we're pretty excited to see what's in store. The trail turns out to be fabulous, after we get through the first two kms of  singletrack to the actual rail-trail. Mike and I have to walk the tandem, the turns are just too tight and the drop-off too risky, but we see and hear single bikes flying (and screeching to a halt!) behind and in front.  The actual old railroad bed, where it starts raining almost in earnest - a very light rain or heavy mist, enough to get us saturated but also refreshingly cool, is about aa 7% grade.  The path is chunky gravel punctuated by stretches of muddy grass - not the easiest surface so we are pretty surprised at how effortlessly we are able to make our way up. Makes us wonder about the grades on some of the paved roads we have been on - MUCH harder riding than this! The scenery is really spectacular out here - so lush! And, completely uninterrupted by any kind of civilization. The rain is coming down pretty good now so we are getting pretty wet. The rain is pretty warm - wonder if this is what it's like to ride in southeast asia? The mountains seem to encircle us in their folds of every shade of green imaginable, packed with ferns, palms and brush.  The climb is from 70 meters to 380 meters at the summit, with 3 tunnels to go through along the way. The last one is the longest, at 550 meters... dead straight, luckily, so we can see the end. WE've brought our headlights but they turn out to be pretty worthless. We end up walking through all three of the tunnels to the summit. They are slick and wet and spooky-fun! The long one, Mike reminds me, at 550 meters is just shorter than the 650 meter long wharf we cycled out, just days ago. Amazing! We start out riding but after about 20 feet we start to get a pretty good sensation of vertigo... and dismount pretty quick! After the summit, we have a very gradual descent on a perfectly graded gravel path with one more small tunnel - we are even able to ride through this one.  I'm amazed at the workmanship of the tunnels, built in the 1880s. I can't imagine the project it must have been!  As we begin the descent, the weather changes quickly from misty to blazing sunny and HOT! Wayne later tells us this is the hottest day he has ever seen in Wellington, a city known for it's cold, rainy and windy days! The gravel road gives us a 'forever descent' where we don't have to pedal or brake, we just float along. Finally we reach the end, where Wayne is waiting with the van. A quick stop for refreshments and we begin the last leg into town. We hop onto Hwy 2 for one last little climb and then a wild and wooly descent where we are catching up to the cars (there ar alot of cars!) on a marvelously smooth stretch of road. Only John stays with us as we tackle the last 25kms or so of city riding down to the campground.  We're travelling pretty quickly with a slight tailwind and a slight downhill to the ocean so I really have to focus on the navigation. Pretty challenging! We're moving so fast that I have to refold the map almost constantly to stay up. With only a few mis-turns and missed turns, quickly corrected, we arrive at the huge campground. It is warm here! We shower up and are ready to eat... take out chinese tonight, I have no energy left to cook. It was a long day, we didn't get off the bike till 4:30pm! It is a beautiful evening and we are all delighted to be able to sit out in chairs and not get rained on or frozen! We get an astrology lesson from Dan tonight, verifying the Southern Cross, and identifying the 7 sisters (Pleides or Subaru) Saturn, Betelguice (sp?) in Orion and Jupiter. With Mike's binoculars, we can clearly see two moons on Jupiter... cool! Thanks to everyone who wrote us this week, it's great to hear from you! 
My friend Anita wrote in the guestbook (thanks for the note!) that this journal isn't up to the standard of humor set in previous expeditions  I think that might be because I'm no longer traveling by myself, and so in some way the journal is speaking for Mike as well as me?   And, these first few weeks have been a time of learning a new routine and experiencing a new culture, but we are really adjusting! Anyway, I wouldn't want it thought that we aren't having any fun so I'll be looking on the lighter side in the coming days! 
Joining us here is Susan from Cedar Rapids Iowa. She's an ex-sys-admin type, 'semi-retired' like many of us on this trip, and in her 50's. She comes to cycling from a hiking background. She's been to Nepal 3x, including a trek to a Mt Everest base camp at around 17,000 ft. Her highest summit is 22,000 ft (without oxygen) so she's no slouch, but she wastes no time and immediately throws out the gauntlet, challenging Bob for the coveted position of last to arrive in camp each afternoon. She's going to fit in with our group just fine! Last night the weather was so balmy it MAY have lulled us into a false sense of security.  The morning is somewhat cloudy but we decide to leave the rainfly open as we make a bus trip into Wellington. We have two days here, and we've decided to make today our 'out and about' day (internet/journal, sight-seeing, eat out, etc) and tomorrow our 'stay in camp' day.  We have a bit of a hard time finding the bus (it's Sunday so the schedule is a lot less regular - and less predictable - than normal) but eventually we are on our way, arriving in Wellington downtown around 11am. We immediately hit an internet caf where I update the journal and Mike checks mail and pays bills etc. While I'm still typing away, Mike has time to check out the local bike shop and stock up on some new supplies for bike cleaning as well as a serving spoon for our meals  it's the little things like trying to serve dinner with a teaspoon that can make us crazy! After a decent lunch of meat pies from a mega-bakery (definitely not up to the high standard we've become accustomed to!), we explore a bit more on foot then take the tram up the side of a huge, steep hill (and through 3 tunnels) to the botanical gardens at the top. The tram itself is another miracle of engineering, designed to open up a 'suburb' area for further development of Wellington, back at the turn of the century. It is STEEP!!!  We do some exploring in the gardens, including visiting an observatory and getting a southern hemisphere star chart, and enjoying the paths through the gardens - magical! One path in particular has its route marked by these tiles set in the pavement so we can't possibly lose our way. Cool! Wait till you see the photo! Finally, we're pretty exhausted and ready to find the bus home. We run into Wayne and Sue at the bus stop and Bob and Ed are already on the bus when it comes by. Small world!  A quick stop at the grocery store for me (Mike isn't allowed to come to the grocery store anymore, it's just too stressful for both of us!!!) and it's a quick trip back to the campground. Miraculously, Allan is on the next bus so he helps me carry the grocery bags to camp - bless you Allan!  By now the sky is really pretty dark (luckily for us it never did rain today on our open rainfly - that was pushing our luck!) and the wind is seriously blowing. We all retire pretty early and don't wake up till the pitter patter of rain intrudes in the morning! 
The sprinkles of rain that awoke us have whipped themselves up into an absolute frenzy of wind and sheets of rain by 8am. Sue takes the opportunity to fly across the yard and into the kitchen, umbrella in tow, to welcome us to 'the Real Wellington - the windy city!'  Glad we're staying here today! It sounds so great to have a lazy day with no real objective (except maybe to read a book!). By 10 or 11am, the laundry is done and the skies are remarkably clear, so Mike goes out to work on the bike. Not long after, he discovers some really bad new: the rim of our rear wheel has a crack in it (two small ones, actually ) right at one of the spokes (you'll get to see the photo here). We don't know how long ago it happened and we don't know how long it will hold together, but it's certain to fail at some point in the near future.   Normally, the thing to do would be to replace the rim and rebuild the wheel. Because this is a tandem wheel, though, things get complicated. This is an 'industrial strength', 40 spoke wheel, so fixing it is likely to be limited by availability of parts.  So much for our relaxing day!  Wayne lets us use his cell phone and we start calling local bike shops here in Wellington to no avail - we leave tomorrow and there isn't a 40 spoke  26' rim to be found. Next alternative, to buy a complete new wheel in a more standard configuration (about $200-300 NZ) also falls through as no one seems to have such a wheel built up out of components that could take the abuse of a tandem.  So, we regroup. While I've been calling, Mike has been studying the damage with Wayne. Maybe it's not as bad as we think. Maybe we can call ahead to a shop and have them order us a rim, and we can ride on this one for a few more days?  I try that for a while, and finally find a suitable rim at Penny Farthing bike shop back in Auckland, a shop we actually visited when we first arrived in NZ! So. We'll try to baby the rim along (maybe sag on any really intense downhill?) and keep an eye on it  and try to make it to Auckland, 10 riding days away. Mike has marked the ends of the crack with a marker so we can easily see if it grows any, over the next few days. Hopefully it will be fine! Mike has already figured out that this is probably the cause of a few weird phenomena we've been experiencing for awhile - a weird 'chirping' sound from the vicinity of the back wheel, and a most unpleasant thumping sensation when we brake really hard  it's because the sidewalls of the rims - both front AND back - are worn so thin that the weld is now 'raised up' in comparison. Doh!  Both rims are basically shot, but at least it's kind of a relief to know what was causing some of the strange noises! With that resolved (as well as it can be), we decide to go and get dinner (after all, crisis or no, we still have to eat!). Thom and Susan join us for a rather wild 5 block or so ride to the fish and chip place (lots of traffic, round-abouts everywhere and a HUGE wind blowing us all over the road in our street clothes and sneakers!), where we all manage to stuff ourselves again. The fish is pretty good but Mike and I agree that the place in Mt Maunganui was better. Thom gets Kumara chips instead of fries. Kumara is what NZ'rs call Sweet Potatoes!  They are in season, I know, because 'NEW CROP' is plastered all over them in the grocery stores and at the vegetable stands. Anyway, I'm not a big French fry fan but I find Kumara chips to be a big step up! They are a bit sweet, and have a good enough flavor to eat without ketchup, vinegar or lemon just a dusting of salt!  After dinner, Mike and Thom somehow find a way to fit in some ice cream (Thom has developed a reputation for his sweet tooth!) and I discover a new vice - NZ Popsicles!!! They have lots of different brands and flavors here and they are GOOD! The one I had was orange, very refreshing  Sharon and John reported eating a total of 10 in one day before they left us. I don't know if I'll be able to beat that record!!!  I could try, though! The wind is still/again raging and really dark clouds are layering one atop another as we make our way back to camp. As the sun goes down, the sprinkles of doom begin again. We don't actually even fear the rain all that much (it's plenty warm, and the tent so far is staying pretty waterproof) but the wind is literally blowing hard enough to make me wonder if the tent poles might break. I spend much of the night awake or only slightly asleep, using my arm to support the one tent pole that is bearing the brunt of the wind and just happens to be right next to my head! It would be funny if it weren't so aggravating!!!  If the wind is still blowing from the north it is going to be a nasty little ride tomorrow! Bordering on dangerous. The gusts have to be around 30-40mph, really an eye-opening blast. We're hoping for the best  and in the back of all of our minds, if worst comes to worst, there's always the possibility of taking the train for most of tomorrow's route! 
Mike and I do coffee and baked goods with the gang - could this become a habit???  And then we decide to keep on going, even without Wayne. Mike is pretty concerned about the wheel and safety issues, and wants to stay ahead of the van as much as possible in the coming days, just in case of a breakdown, so we'll be able to get a ride if we need one. The road we turn onto as we leave the suburbs turns out to be a fabulous one-lane (not one lane in each direction, one LANE period!), twisty-windy, narrow path through a spectacularly lush tropical green gorge, following a river gently uphill. One (another!) of our definite picks for the top 10 roads in NZ! We got a photo.  We truly ARE on the 'wet and windy' west side of the island now! It is literally like a tropical rainforest - except the temperature is about 70 degrees, and it's windy! Wayne catches up to us at about 45 kms and stages an impromptu lunch stop at the side of the road  marvelous! A quick look at the map and I realize that we are in for a pretty short day - there can't be much more than 30 kms left!  After lunch it turns out there's a quick 2km to the top of the hill we've been climbing all morning (getting steeper all the while), where we steal a quick glance at the ocean (photo), then begin another breathtaking descent back to it! Mike and I are being extra careful, babying the rim along, and the good news is, it seems to be holding together so far! It's a quick trip into Waikanae (Why-can-I) where we get on Hwy 1 - whoa, traffic again! So glad we didn't have to go on this road the whole way! Nice wide shoulder, though, so that helped! WE do have a pretty good crosswind but the road is almost dead flat  16 more kms and a few curves and we're there! If this isn't the easiest day we've had, it's close to it!  Great ride, great day! Our campground today, Byron's Resort, seems either to have delusions of grandeur or is living on past glory (I've nicknamed it 'Byron's Last Resort'!).  Pretty run-down, but it has odd features like a squash court and a ping-pong room and a rusty old swimming pool. Clean and cozy, though, so it's still far and above a US campground! The sky is relatively clear so we're hopeful for tomorrow! For now though, it's Popsicle time! We've already devoured spaghetti with steak, carrots, broccoli, fresh corn on the cob and numerous slices of buttered bread! As if that isn't enough, Allan has found my weakness and has been leading me into sin, tempting me with cheese-flavored rice cakes (they call them crackers here!) - evil man!  Susan also asks me to add that she's proud to report that she survived the first day with only one small 'tip-over'  that might not sound so great except that she also discovered she spent half the day with her front wheel quick release lever unfastened! LUCKILY it was noticed just before the big descent began! Yikes! 
The first stretch is not too inspiring - busy highway, even with a nice shoulder, is still a busy highway!  We turn off and head into the foothills after about 20 kms of trucks speeding past us and a mild but annoying headwind in our faces.  Little do we know that these will turn out to be some of the easiest riding of the day! We soon get into some pretty serious rollers as we head fro the lunch stop - it comes early today in the town of Shannon, 40 kms into the day. We are on this road, a lesser highway with fewer trucks but smaller shoulder, for much of the day.  Wayne and Sue haven't ever ridden this stretch, only driven it. So we have more mystery about the distances and terrain than usual. At lunch, Mike and I both probably eat too much (or too many kinds of things or the wrong combinations) and stay off the bike a little too long. When we get back on the bike we know we are in trouble! The terrain just gets hillier (with a constant slight uphill trend) and the headwind gets windier and soon it feels like we've been out there forever! We haven't, though  'Forever' comes MUCH later in the day, as we're still slogging along. The countryside is pretty but it's hard to appreciate it when we feel we are struggling so much (and my stomach is telling me that I REALLY should have thought before I had tuna AND peanut-butter and jelly at lunch! We manage to drum up a little interest as we pedal up and down through he rolling hills near Palmerston North (distinguishing it from the Palmerston on the South Island, we're later told) as we ride past the beautiful campus of Massey University. Further on, we ride past 'Owlcatraz', an intriguing name! We don't stop, but we learn from Allan that it is an Owl refuge, reclaimed from a prior dumpsite!  Finally, as we are about to give up all hope, we stagger into Ashhurst, the last town before our destination. The last 15 kms or so to here were quite hilly but almost devoid of traffic. We get a coke here and split it  it revives us enough to tackle the last 20 kms - which turn out to be on another one-lane, narrow, winding and even hillier, but really beautiful stretch of road. We escape the headwind here and for whatever the reason it turns out to be the most enjoyable (if not the easiest!) stretch of the day! Today by some good fortune we have no problem finding the campground, a really cute little place with ducks, guinea hens and peacocks running around loose. The office is closed when we arrive, but an older guy walks up and tells us that Wayne is already parked in back (he's still driving, back still hurting!).  I ask the guy if he has a coke for sale in the office and he says 'No, but how do you like ice cream?'  Naturally we tell him that we like ice cream pretty well! He says to go back to the van, he'll meet us there with cones!  Moments later, as we're chatting with way, the guy comes out of a 'caravan' (motor home to us) with two vanilla cones for Mike and I!  He goes back, then comes back with two more, one for himself and one for Wayne. Turns out he's another guest at the park, not the owner at all! He packs a mean scoop, though, I'll say that for him! 
The morning is pretty mild and there's plenty of sun. It's a beautiful day for a pretty back-road ride. Pastoral rolling terrain, NO cars! The countryside starts out flat but just gets hillier and hillier as the day goes on. The morning is a bit of a  grind as it seems a lot more up  than down  no hill is more than a couple of kms (if even that), but they follow one another relentlessly! At the viewpoint for Mt Ruapehu, we get to see a great view of the plateau we're on, with all the carved out river canyon layers cutting deep, dramatic slashing lines in the scenery. Fascinating! It's like a little mini geology lesson on the fly. After, we descend into the river canyon, step by step making our way further and further down. Then it's basically up and up and out the other side to lunch. Hope our photo of the region turns out because it is pretty darn cool! WE go a bit easier on the food at lunch today, and with a shorter break, it seems to help a lot. After lunch, we have a real treat - about 40 kms of really isolated, remote, periodically one-lane road. Really wonderful! We're still climbing a lot but at least now we're also getting some flat/downhill stretches in. Sure helps the kms to fly by, in spite of the headwind!  WE have two biggish climbs in the afternoon (just like in the morning!) - one at the beginning and one at the end of the secondary road. In between the terrain is surprisingly dry but strikingly beautiful. It reminds me somewhat of the badlands in North and South Dakota - really eroded river beds and brown hills. Susan reminds me, though, that the scenery is all much more compact here  and the hills are a lot hillier! We get a nice scenic overlook at the top of the last hill - and we are hoping for a nice downhill into town. But our hopes are dashed as we fight a headwind that's increasingly stronger with each passing km! The last stretch seems interminable! WE see the ribbon of road in front of us for miles, descending ever so slightly, but we aren't able to get any traction!  Finally, finally we get to descend right down into Manganui, a brake-grabber descent with a full complement of traffic. A bit of a let-down in the end but still a relief!  We find a  fast food join tot help us make the last 5kms to camp as we are riding on fumes of energy! Speaking of food, I thought you'd be entertained to hear just what you can eat when you ride for 4-5 hours every day. Here's what we ate today, with an estimated calorie count: Janine:  Breakfast: 3 HB eggs _ 2 slices toast with butter, one with jam + 3 small plums + hot cocoa (900 cal) Lunch: 1 chicken meat pie + 1 can coke (500 cal) During ride: l liter gatorade substitute (400 cal) After ride: 1 toasted cheese, fried egg and tomato sandwich (600 cal) Dinner: 1 huge portion of tuna and macaroni salad (3 cups at least) + a huge portion of steamed carrots with butter + 5 big crackers and half an avocado (900 cal) Grand total: 2900 cal Mike: Breakfast: 4 slices toast with PBJ + coffee (800 cal) Lunch: chicken meat pie + 1 cup dates + 1 can coke (800 cal) During ride: 1 liter gatorade substitute (400 cal)       After ride: 'the works' burger: patty, bacon, ham, fried egg + thick shake (1000 cal) Dinner:  5 cups tuna salad, 3 slices bread with butter Grand total: 4200 cal In case you don't know us we are both of average height and build, tending toward the muscular. We aren't gaining weight but I don't think we're losing much, either!!! 
The campground is another pretty small, city-run site, but this one is immaculately clean. Rows of pots and pans sit on the shelves beside rows of dishes and silverware, cutting boards and utensils, awaiting our use  amazing!  We arrive approximately with Allan after separate 'snack breaks' on the way into town, and sit around for an hour or so before the van arrives and we can get organized. After making camp and showers, Allan and I walk together to the grocery store (Mike is relieved to be again dismissed from this favorite domestic chore!) and back with a full load (our upper body workout!). Allan is getting to be quite the sherpa, carrying my stuff around!  We daringly try a 'short cut' through the park next to the campground (this complex is really huge!) and, though it may be no shorter in actuality, we enjoy discovering a huge garden area with rose garden, cactus garden, English hedge maze, Japanese garden with koi pond and island and bridge  a huge pond with ducks and a great kids play area, a swim center (I ALMOST get my act together for an evening swim!) and tons of playing fields for cricket, lacrosse and rugby. Wow, what a place!  And all this is for a city of 10,000 people! We get 'home' and I immediately start cooking when I discover, much to my chagrin, that the huge slab of beef I bought for tonight's and tomorrow's dinner is MISSING IN ACTION!! With panic in my heart, I get Mike to saddle up the pony for a quick trip back to the store  it MUST be there  and I have no heart for a repeat of the 5 block walk - gardens or no!  We are soon at the grocery store, where my  beef awaits patiently me  another crisis narrowly averted! Speaking of crises, the rear wheel seems to be holding together just fine, not worsening at all, that we can tell! Another great day in paradise! 
Taranaki (or Mt Egmont as it was renamed by white settlers) is one of the 4 mountain peaks in the north island. Unlike the south island which boasts some 'alp-like' terrain, the north island is relatively flat (relatively!!!!).  According to Maori legend, all four mountains once lived together in peace in the center of the island. But Tongariro caught Taranaki fooling around with Pihango, Tongariro's wife, and banished Taranaki. He traveled  to the very edge of the west coast, carving out the Whanganui River in the process, where he sits in isolation to this day. However it got there, Taranaki totally dominates the horizon  as you'll see from the photo!  We're suffering from a pretty poor-sleep night (turns out there's one of those big streetlights right outside of our tent window, DOH!) , but it doesn't even seem to matter  the view is so magnificent!  At first we're riding through farms and fields and the terrain seems almost level (of course we have a tiny bit of a headwind, too). But gradually, gradually the slope begins to pick up as we climb closer and closer to the actual mountain. Once we start the 13 km side trip, it really begins to feel like we are climbing, even though it's still only about a 5% grade. Quite dramatically, the scenery changes from cleared pasture to a 'scenic reserve' where the tropical forest rises up overhead and almost shuts the sun out from overhead. And now we are really climbing. We make it most of the way in the middle chainring but in the last km or two, we realize that we are going to have to surrender and we shift into the little ring. First time we've used it since we started up the western coast from Wellington! We get some good photos, though. And, here I have my first sighting of Treebeard. The Lord of the Rings fans will be familiar with the name .  I can't get a photo because there's too much other background greenery but the likeness is uncanny! We eventually manage to get to the Falls, and then somehow, spend an hour goofing around there (between the falls, the lookout platform and the caf and nature center, it's not hard to do!) before we start back down. We think we have nothing to worry about; after all we should have only 40 kms to go (or less!) on this ride that was originally billed as 78 kms long!  We actually have several options to  get to New Plymouth on the other side of the mountain  more highway to the east, a highway to the west on the coast the whole way, and a small country road that circles the mountain about half-way between the top and the coast, on the west side - this is our recommended route.  We start out; picking the recommended route because we want to have the van behind us in case of any wheel problem. At first, we are FLYING along with the help of a slight tailwind through countryside that just rolls effortlessly along. However we continue to roll and roll along and we don't seem to be getting much closer to the other side! After about 30 kms, the end is nowhere in sight, our tailwind has turned on us and the rolling hills are getting steeper and longer. The mileage continues to accumulate, but we still have a long way to go. Uh oh. We approach a town (on the map it's a town, anyway!) of Tumahu, where our hopes of a coke are cruelly dashed Nothing but a crossroads and a meeting hall. And we have 90 kms for the day so far. For sure it's another 30 to go  so we stage our own mini rest-stop and munch on dates and almonds while we contemplate the road ahead. The only bright side: the looming clouds seem to have departed, taking with them the threat of rain and thunderstorm!  Just as we're getting ready to go on, Sue pulls up in the van - Wayne's back must be finally feeling better! We visit with her for a few minutes, refill our water and leave, with Sue's parting words ringing in our ears, 'One last big climb before the descent into New Plymouth!' Oh joy. We set off and start climbing pretty much immediately. The climb is relentless and the humidity is high, not the best conditions for tired legs! Where is that nice cool wind now, we wonder? We do get a little break when we run into a big bunch of cows crossing the road.  One cow runs away from the rest and so we stop and wait while 'old bessie' gets rounded up by the farm hand. I use the opportunity wisely to stock up on wild blackberries though!  We get back on the bike and resume climbing - today is going to beat all for total elevation gain! We're already at 4000 feet and the end is not in sight! After the cow crossing, though, we enter a section where the road is only about 8 ft wide, the banks reach up so high it's like a tunnel (a nice, cool tunnel!) and the road twists and snakes along relentlessly! Luckily for us, the terrain here changes to an up and down rhythm that's pretty forgiving for a tandem. Down to a river, then back up up up and down again to another river  again and again!  At last we are making some decent progress! We are reveling in the scenery and the road and the bike  it is all fabulous! At last we pedal up to the famous Rhododendron Gardens shown on the map, where we stop at the caf for a quick coke and another visit with Sue.  Coupled with a Moro bar (like a Snickers!) it's got to fuel us for the last 20 or so kms to camp  unless we decide to steal the battery-powered chair-things we see sitting temptingly beside the building! But no, that would be cheating!  So it's back on the bike AGAIN (this ride seems eternal!) for a few more climbs, twists, turns, and descents (by my count 8 climbs of any significance - ouch!) before we finally do really begin our 'final descent' into New Plymouth. And it is quite a ride! We FLY! When we get into town (which I think bears a remarkable resemblance to Santa Cruz in CA), we are able to make our way without any big issues or errors to our motor park right where the ocean meets the land. Apparently there is a Striped Marlin fishing tournament going on here so we are sharing the camp with a lot of big FISHING boats! Naturally all of the guys are intrigued! We visit with a few and they seem to think we are as crazy as we think they are  so the world stays in balance! Truly an epic day. 
Most of us (all except Allan and Thom who want to rest, and Mike who's knee isn't really fit for hiking anymore) pile into the van at around 9am and set out for the northern trailhead (with an obligatory stop at a bakery along the way!). The trail turns out to be wonderful. The first third or so is immaculately groomed. It is deeply cut into the mountain (the dirt side walls of the trail rise up to 4ft and much higher in spots), giving it an 'Indiana Jones' kind of feeling, with all the ferns and palms and mossy undergrowth. The trail here is largely stair steps up and up and up with all-too-brief segments of walking in between. Then the trail opens out a bit and we walk up the very ridgeline for a bit, somehow missing a turn in the process, and find ourselves in a 'scrambling' section that's a bit more challenging but lots of fun!  Then, after we discover our 'mistake', we rejoin the main trail for a quick traverse across another ridge through a sandy-slidey section more-or-less above the tree line. Soon we arrive at a hiker's hut (our destination for lunch and our highest point for the day) where we all huddle away from the wind and cold cloud, which has been creeping down the mountain to meet us!  Soon it's time to head downhill. This is where the real torture sets in for me. The trail down is much bigger than the trail up was - almost a freeway, as the photo will show! The first kilometer or so actually has tow cement tracks (for emergency vehicles?) with dirt in the center  and it goes STRAIGHT down the line.  I've never seen anything quite like it!  As we switch onto a more traditional dirt fire-road type trail I am thanking the gods  my quads are going to kill me tomorrow, I know already! And, my toes are starting to get a bit too well acquainted with the front ends of my sneakers! However as we continue to plummet down I quickly realize that the dirt is no more forgiving than the cement was  and it goes on a lot longer! I can't quite believe that we climbed this much! Eventually though the torturous descending does end and we arrive back at the trailhead. What a wonderful alternative to sitting on a bike all day! I vow (not the first time) to work more hiking into my life when we get back home. My legs are pretty tired but I know I'll REALLY pay the price tomorrow and the next day when the soreness has fully set in. Yikes! But, it was worth it  and I'm way too stubborn to take an Advil! After the hike we visit the nature center and of course the caf located within, which is very nice!  After an hour or so, we pry our weary bones out of the chairs and head for the van. A stop at the grocery store on the way home is greatly appreciated by all as it means we don't have to lug our bags further than the van!  Susan and I share a cart and wander wide-eyed through the aisles of Pak and Save, mesmerized by all the choices (NEVER go to the grocery store hungry!). At least we'll be able to give Wayne and Sue some cheap entertainment as we try to figure out how to store all the stuff we bought in our little food bins! Finally we get 'home' and begin to think about dinner (there's a theme here  food!). I have big plans tonight, I'm going to attempt French Toast! Combined, in a daring culinary foray, with fresh corn on the cob that looked so good at the store I HAD to buy it! I don't have room to carry it so we'll just have to eat it!  Everything turns out great (the corn is the best I've had since we got here) and the final score is: Mike: French Toast 9, fresh corn 0; and Janine: French Toast 4 and fresh corn 4. Who's the real winner here? Maybe it's the grocery store! Mike and I take a nice little walk along the beach and enjoy the sunset  he's pretty tired too. It turns out he walked about 6kms into town and back, probably further than we hiked! 
Skies are cloudy but no rain is predicted. Today is another day on Hwy 3 all day - two lanes of fast-paced traffic, very rough chipseal, relatively easy rolling terrain and a slight headwind to make it a bit more challenging. Just another wonderful day on the bike! There are no major cities on our route today. The morning is spent shaking free of much of the New Plymouth traffic. Turns out today is a local 'district' anniversary day or holiday. New Zealanders take their holidays pretty seriously. The have the usual 12 - 15 or so national holidays similar to those of the US, but in addition, each district has it's own set of holidays commemorating founders, wars, whatever  and then even the cities will each have their own set of holidays. On a holiday, all the banks and schools, all government offices and most business will be closed. Mike and I are getting pretty low on NZ currency and I had planned to hit a bank on the way out of town but it looks like that won't be happening after all!  It will be fun to see how long we can stretch our last $30NZ!  We probably won't starve (both because we have about 3 weeks of food stockpiled and because someone's bound to loan us a few $$ if we develop a Popsicle or ice cream crisis!).  We're on our way. The ride to the lunch stop is a gentle, easy ride (or it would be for me if my quads and calves weren't screaming with every pedal rotation!) in spite of the really rough chipseal. Quite uneventful riding under overcast skies, a good thing under the circumstances. We take only a short lunch break in anticipation of the 600 ft, 3km climb that awaits us shortly after. When I get off the bike and try to walk a few steps I realize that my legs are still getting sorer with every hour that passes by. Of course I have no one to blame but myself - and I would do it all again if given the opportunity! Mike says I never learn  I guess he's right! We get on the bike after lunch and somehow make it to the top of the hill (luckily Mike isn't as sore as me!) and start the twisty descent when I feel the most dreaded sensation - a thump, thump, thump from the rear wheel. 'Stop the bike!' I cry, but it turns out to be just a piece of gravel tarred to the tire. Whew! We work our way through a few turns and then, on an inauspiciously rough stretch of road, Mike calls out, 'Stopping - the front fender is falling off!' Turns out it has cracked almost all the way in half, right at the point where the brakes are. We end up taking the whole fender off and strapping it to the rack and pack in back (!). Now we really look like tourists! We waddle through the rest of the ride, carefully  but without further incident, through the town of Mokau and on to our seaside campground.  The beach here has almost pure black sand, it's very dramatic! After a quick dinner (sweet and sour beef - I'll try to cook ANYTHING with beef here, it's so good!), it's movie night, so, gotta go! 
We hide out in the tent till 7am (a record!) and finally get up, pack everything and throw our fate to the rainy winds. This may be the day when our luck rains out  or will we get lucky again?  We all have a quick breakfast and get the low-down on today's ride: mostly flat, we're told, with one hill (short but steep) right after lunch. The morning is on Hwy 3 and the afternoon is mostly all on small secondary roads.   Our destination today is Waitomo Caves, a little 'Adventure Tourist' spot which features an apparently significant set of caves with rivers inside for rafting, openings for rappelling  (or Abseiling as the Brits call it!) up to 100 meters down and all sorts of other 'concocted' adventure action (river tubing, 4WD ATVing, glow-worm watching, you name it!) which can be added in for a price. It ain't cheap; 4 hours run about$100 to $200 NZ, and a full 7-hour day of adventure is up to $350!  Mike and I will probably just hang out or go for a hike  but first we need to get there! We start out in drizzle under gloomy skies. It's pretty warm so we quickly shed our jackets. The scenery is indeed lush and green, and the terrain, at least at first, mild.  We are following a series of rivers upstream so we are climbing but it's very gentle. The river valleys are fairly narrow and very rich in undergrowth. Though it has almost stopped right now, it MUST rain a lot here! We're getting back to that striking mix of palms, ferns, pines an deciduous trees that we remember from our first days out of Auckland. As we get closer to the lunch stop, the terrain gets hillier, with one really nasty climb that has Mike convinced that it must be the 'tough' climb promised for AFTER lunch! I'm not so sure though  The terrain looks like it could get increasingly hilly for quite some time. We're climbing up out of the ferny glens and into more open, spacious fields of grass. Our pace slows with the climbing but eventually we do get to the lunch stop, where after a few short minutes, the rain returns, with a new level of intensity. Darn! We wait for a few more minutes to see if it will let up; but it shows no signs of stopping so we get back into our raincoats and set off  it looks like it COULD clear up later but who knows?  The promised short, steep climb after lunch never seems to materialize as we head up the quiet secondary road  in fact the series of climbs we encounter are neither short nor step but are in fact pretty much continuous!  Each time we think we're to the top, we round another curve and see more  we don't really mind too much because the climb is keeping us warm! So much so, in fact, that we quickly shed our jackets again. Eventually though, after about 15-20 kms of steady climbing, just as the rain starts to fall with a vengeance, we seem to reach some kind of a summit. We manage to get the rain gear back on at just the opportune moment as the skies open, and we begin a brief but technical descent.  Mike has some concern because rainy downhills that require a lot of braking are probably the worst thing we can do for our poor tired wheel rims  but we don't have a lot of choice! With every km that we pedal, it is raining harder now. This is our first real rain-ride on the trip. Big fat hard cold drops are falling through the holes in our helmets and between our jackets and our necks (brrrh!) and the splashes from the road onto our shins reach the proportion of small icy creeks running down into our shoes! We quickly reach that point in the ride that I call the 'saturation point' - we're not going to get much wetter!  The scenery is probably really magnificent here but it's hard to notice. We're focused on staying warm (but not working up a sweat), watching the road and traffic for potential menace (it's actually raining so hard it's tough to see clearly!) and mostly, just on moving forward through the monsoon. After a half hour or so of rolling hills (ideal conditions for rain riding, actually, as there aren't more than a few mild descents and enough quick steep pitches up to keep us warm), we emerge back onto Hwy 3 for the last 15 kms or so on flat busy road with wide shoulders and some of the roughest chipseal we've seen yet! Now our strongest thoughts are, 'I hope we can upgrade to a cabin' and 'I'm sure glad we don't have to ride tomorrow!' It's going to take us awhile to clean ourselves (and the bike) back up after this! I will say this for 'supported' touring - it is wonderful to know that our gear is completely dry at our destination. If it were in panniers, it wouldn't be a question of if it were wet; it would be a question of just how wet it was. Finally, after a few last kms of gentle climbing (and by now my still-sore quad muscles are completely confused by the cold and wet and work), we sight the campground - and we are ready to get off the bike! Like a wonderful dream, cabins, hot showers and warm food await us! The group all rides in on their own power (Wayne went back out to search for anyone who needed a lift but we are all stubborn, I guess!) in varying states of disarray but universally delighted with the cabin option! The cabins actually turn out to be pretty poorly insulated  Mike and Susan (she's sharing with us) both resort to earplugs when we realize we can hear the person in the next room snoring while we're alls still up reading!  I can't stand earplugs but I don't think I'll have much trouble sleeping. This is a real bed here, after all! In all, the best thing about the cabin (besides the watertight roof!) must be the electric light switch, which lets us read until whenever we want to! We stay up till near 10, a record probably! 
It really is a glorious day. We have in mind to take a 25km roundtrip ride to an aviary that's supposed to have the best nocturnal kiwi house in NZ... there's also a nice free hike that apparently goes to a few caves so we may try some of that, too! If we see a grocery store there's a few things we could use. That's about it for our aggressive 'day off' plans!  It's right  when Mike decides to clean the bike th at disaster strikes! While cleaning the rear weheel he notices that the braking survace has some weird crease-like cracks in i, right near the weld. Upon further examination (after he removes the tire) we see an even bigger crack - about 8 inches long! - that goes althe way through the braking surface. I can bend the whole edge of the rim in wiht on e hand! We are done riding on this wheel... Looks like we will have to figure out the best way to get it fixed. My hopes of it holding out for the rest of the tour are dashed! But, we are SO lucky that we made it in yesderday without a blowout. Yikes! We don't even want to think about the roadrash we would get from this rough road surface... and Mike tells me that we actually hit 70 km/hour on one of the brief descents yesterday!!! Needless to say, we don't make it to the Kiwi aviary. We spedn a few hours makig phone calls and considering options , then we go out for a hile an dget some perspective. This hike (largely the only 'free' outdoor attraction here!), which Thom sniffed out, is marked out on a photocopied sheet kept behind the desk at the info/booking centers, where the eyes are assaulted by literally hundreds of fancy 4-color brochures advertising every kind of adventure imaginable!  Lucky for us that we even found out about the hike! The trailhead turns out to be right next to our campground. The trail is described to us as a 3-4 hour return (round trip) and the map shows an out-and back wiht a little loop at the far end.  Not knowing what to expect, we join Wayne and Sue and Bob and set off (Allan, Susan and Ed all decided to go for the 7-hour full adventure package, earlier in the day!). The first part of the trail is full of jungle with some twists, turns and steps (taking a photo I here some gus talking about Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom in  a thick german accent - funny! Then we move into a long stretch that is cow pasture an driver.. uneventful but nice and easy hiking! I'm very conscious of Mike's bad knee and concerned about overdoing it... but at least we don't ahve to worry about riding tomorrow! All of a sudden, on the other side of the river, the bank rise up into a sort of cliff fact that's covered in deep jungle undergrowth, and we begin to feel the coolnes of underground air waftin gtowards us - neat! We start seeing put-ins and take-outs for the rafters around here. We find a little 'hidey-hole'  cave that overlooks the river which is no, somhow, many feedt below us - we're way high up on its bank. This is getting alittle more adventurous! Soon, we find ourselves at a little park-like informaiitno cneterw ith route info and a sign that says "Walk to Underground Tunnel Viewing Platform - 30 minute Return". We're not really sure what that means, but Wayne and Sue are pretty enthusiastic. Mike decides that his knee will hold up if we take the road back to camp (we've been hiking for at least an hour already), so we go for it! We set out on the trail and almost immediately we are in a clool, grotto-like environment with incredibly elaborate pathways, bridges and viewing platforms that let us look down into the depths easily 100-200 feet underground into the caves and rivers below. I hope the photos turn out!   We are all astonished by the 'cool factor' on this FREE walk! WE certainly get our $$$ worth!  And, Mike thought best of all, we start our walkback to camp via the road (which turnsout to be a pretty significant hike in itself) and after about a half hour of hiking, we're surprised by a horn tooting behind us. It's one of the adventure guides, offering us a ride back to the tavern! Without hesitation we all pile in... luxury!  We try to buy our hero a drink but he has to pick up more customers. It would have taken us an hour or so to have walked in! We spend the evening finalizing plans for the next few days... we're going to take the bus to Auckland to ensure that we can get tehwheels fixed in time! WE will miss the last 3 days of riding on the second section, but it can't be helped. 
The riders all set out and we help Sue to pack up the van. It's especially hard not to ride today: beautiful scenery, smooth (relatively) and flat road, no cars, sunshine and tailwind! Sue shuttles us up to the 'lunch break' where she switches with Wayne, who drives us to Hamilton in plenty of time to catch the 12:30 pm bus for Auckland. We're carrying our 2 wheels, a few clothes, sleeping bags, some cooking supplies (just in case) and minimal toiletries. Still it makes an impressive pile of stuff!  We are off on our onw adventure! After we get in to Auckland, we are able to find a bank and exchange $$$ and get a room in a 'Backpackers' (kind of a youth hostel-like, low rent motel) for $60 a night. After we stach our backpacks there, it's a 30 minute walk to the bike shope where we spend some time with the mechanic, Michael (it's pretty complicated, what with our existing hubs (40-spoke) and their in-stock rims ( mostly 32 spoke) and all the related compatibility issues and component choices. Mike and Michael figure it out, and we set off with the hopes that the wheels will be built by the end of the day tomorrow. Worst case, it will be done on Sunday. We end up with one new 40 hole rim for the rear, so the wheel can be rebuilt and one completely new 36 spoke wheel for the front (we'll take the 40 spoke hub home and rebuild it later). We are filled with new hope! With minds at rest, we walk back towards the Backpackers', with a brief stop for dinner. We spend the evening scoping out the area near the Backpackers for bakeries, internet and souveniers. By 8)) we are back in our little shoebox of a room (did I mention the 'ocean view'? Check it out in the photo!). Mike says this is the worst place he's ever stayed in... but I have to admit I've been in quite a few worse places! We finally connect with Sergei and Irena Gulaev, friends of Julia and Peter Lester, and residents here in Auckland. We make plans to meet for lunch on Saturday. Looking forward to it!  Now - it's off to dreamland! 
At the appointed time we call the shop (it's Penny-Farthing Bicycles on Khyber Pass Rd at Symond St in Auckland, they're GREAT, if you're ever in the neighborhood!) and the new wheels are ready! They also have the surprising news that our group is already at the campground in Manukau City, a full day early! As we walk back to the bike shop, we are elated about the wheels but alittle concerned about everyone on the trip - hopefully it is not bad news! We pick up the wheels without further event. Mike is very satisfied with them. As a thank-you, we give Michael a North Rim Adventure Sports t-shirt (that's the bike shop where Mike works!). Wheels in tow, we return to the backpackers... it's too late to cancel our room and it would be complicated to change our plans with Sergei and Irina... plus we are kind of looking forward to 'staying up late' and watching the city night scene for awhile! I haven't been out in a city at night in YEARS! We stay up (and out) pretty late, doing a bit more journal updating at the internet cafe (we've spent so much time there that they are giving us the discount rate!), with a break for dinner... and then, around 10:30 or so, we take a nice walk around the city, watching the night life. It's pretty active here!  It's a big college town, so there are alot of kids and alot of places that are open at night. Even at this early hour, things are hopping! It has been a real (and unexpected) treat, watching the ebb and flow of the city for the last 24 hours.  In the morning, we saw all the workers flooding the streets heading for work, and then watched the streets quiet as the clock rolled past 9am. The streets were packed again, with a different energy, at noon... and then a whole new energy at 5pm.  As the evening progressed, the dinner crowd somehow transitioned into the night crowd as the city metamorphosed before our eyes into a night animal, glittering with lights and mystery. Something we never would have seen on this trip if not for our wheels wearing out! 
Sergei and Irina have graciously agreed to pick us up at the Backpackers at 11am, and later, bring us down to the campground in Manukau City! We're outside, packed and ready, at 11. After a few minutes, we begin to wonder whether they have the right Backpackers (there are probably over 20 different ones in downtown Auckland alone!)? We've told them to look for two people carrying two bicycle wheels - so we should be easy to spot! They soon arrive - it turns out they HAD gone to the wrong place first, but no harm done!  Quickly we are whisked away (in a CAR!) to a lovely oceanside cafe in Mission Bay, a small community on the east side of Auckland - beautiful beach park, charming cafes, restaurants and stores - upscale but with a very warm community feeling. Sergei and Irina used to live here but recently moved to a more conveniently located place with more room for Irina's father who lives with them... but I can tell that their hearts (especially Irina's) are still here! After a nice walk along the beach (complete with windsurfer rental, pony rides and refreshment stands), we hop back into the car and drive to their house for lunch. We have a wonderful visit and get to know each other a bit... it almost feels like we already know them through our friendship with Peter and Julia! Peter and Irina came to NZ from Russia, 5 years ago. They met Peter and Julia because they all were active in a sister-city program between San Jose CA and Ekaterinburg (hope I didn't spell that TOO badly!). Peter ended up teaching Sergei and Irina's son, Sasha at San Jose State University before he retired!  Sergei is a professor of Mathematics and Earth Sciences (I think!) at the university here in Auckland, but his true passions are Astronomy and Physics. Irina is an instructor of opera singing and of violin! They both are very active here in their adopted home.  Peter and Julia, they send you fond greetings! After a delicious lunch of chicken caesar salad and a baked 'meat pie' made of  layered dough, potato slices, chicken meat and dough (I believe this is a Russian dish?) all made by Irina, and a light dessert of watermelon, papaya, tea and cookies, Sergei and Irina deliver us to the campground at Manukau City, where they give us a little 'care package' of cookies and crackers and delicious strawberry tea - what a nice treat! Thank you both!  We haven't seen the last of Sergei and Irina, though,...; they've generously agreeed to let us store the tandem with them while we visit the south island in the first week of April! Peter and Julia, thank you for sharing these dear friends with us! FYI we're (Sergei, Irina, Mike and I) already plotting to bring you two bakc here with us again next year for another visit! So, be prepared!  The rest of the afternoon, and into the evening, is spent uneventfully, visiting and catching up with everyone (thankfully it turns out the group just decided to put in a big mile day (130 hilly kms!) to get to the campground a day early, so we can start the last leg a bit early and use the 'extra rest day' at some more exotic location in the northlands!).  Our friend Sherry Smith arrives tomorrow morning for the northlands segment, can't wait to see her! And Peter and Julia, tha
Mike and I wake up at about the usual time, anyway... It's been raining lightly for most of the night so everything outside is pretty wet. Once I get out of the tent, I'm not getting back in, so it's up before 6am with the time change! Sherrry arrives right on time at 7:30 am, with all her luggage and bike safely retrieved from Qantas' care. She's alittle punchy (I remember THAT feeling!) but still we have a great visit and hang out a bit in the common room while getting her acquainted with the rest of the crew.  She gets her bike put together with out issue (except for Mike bugging her about skinny tires, about not enough gears for teh hills, about having road shoes instead of Mt Bike shoes, about anything else he can thing of - isn't he getting to be the experienced world-bike-traveller?).  Luckily, she can take it (and hand it out!). As mke getst eh wheels all back on the bike and the brake pads replace, the clouds start to break up overhead and it looks like we'll be able to get in a dry ride!  By the time we saddle up, in fact, the day is WARM and still quite humit. We just take a quick spin out to the botanical gardens (the place we raced past on teh VERY first day of our tour) which turns out to be a wonderful place!   With the help of the resident plant expert, we are FINALLY able to identify the legendary Silver Fern (the undersides of teh leaves and the new branches are all silvery-white), the official plant of New Zealand! Cool, see the photo when it gets here!  It grows up to 10m tall, now wonder we didn't find it looking on the ground!  The test ride goes without a hitch (though the new brake pads are screaming!). The bike seems more stable, nice and steady. There's no more thumping when we brake, and no more unexplainable noises! The chirp is finally gone! This afternoon - laundry and groceries. 
Having said that, there are a few things I would say about the riding on the west coast. It was, as promised, wetter - but not by alot. It was also windier - but a fair part of the time was a tailwind, so that at least wasn't too bad! The roads had alot less traffic (and there were quite a few really neat side roads that got us off the beaten track)...  the hills were less steep and shorter.  The scenery was beautiful if a bit less spectacular and the economic situation of most of the cities and towns was more 'middle of the road'... less upscale and trendy than the tourist spots on the Coromandel Peninsula but less poor than alot of the East Cape towns. Seemed to be alot more british influence on the west side as well. The cycling highlight was definitely Mt Taranaki and Dawsons' Falls there. Really great cycling and really fascinating topography - perhaps more memorable than any other part of the trip - with the possible exception of the Rimutaka Grade on the way into Wellington. Anyway, all in all the west side turns out to be a wonderful way to spend two weeks!
We get the day started at a leisurely pace because we want to let the traffic die down before we try to fit all our bikes and ourselves on the train.  Sherry masterminds a really decadent kick-off breakfast of breaded grilled pork chops, eggsa nd yesterday's leftover fried potatoes - fabulous! It's going to be great having someone to cook with! We finally depart Manukau City around 10am. Mike, Sherry and I end up riding to Swanson with Wayne and Sue in the 'SueMobile' (our new name for the van, because their van at home is known as the 'WayneMobile'!) so that there will be more room on the train for the other bikes (and the other paying passengers!). There's no bike storage area, apparently you just bring the bike onto the trian with you. We figure it will be easier to get the tandem on the SueMobile (we've had some recent practice at that!) than onto the train.  It's a short and uneventful ride to the Swanson train station, where we reunite with the rest of the gang and (finally!) start cycling. Mike, Sherry and I start out and it is pretty funny watching (and listening to) Sherry as she gets used to bein gon the left side of the road - though I KNOW we were just the same, 6 short weeks ago!  It's a pleasant enough ride, the first 15 kms or so on narrow hilly side roads and the last 25 on the busier, biger Hwy 16. The highlight of the ride comes when we see some very frisky steer getting herded inot a pasture with sheep and some really pretty deer already in it! We stop for photos and the steer run to us, bucking and kicking away like mad, scattering the deer in the process. Then, when we take their photo, they stampede to the other side of the field, bucking and kicking some more, and even head-butting some of the sheep!  When we finally leave, the sheep are hiding, the steers are still feisty, and the deer  are posing a stand-ins for Rudolph and the rest of Santa's crew at the top of the hill, just in front of the farmhouse! When we reach our destination, the van still hasn't passed us, so we decide to wanderinto Hellensville for a 'sneaky snack'. We find a really charming cafe called Upper Crust (also the name of our favorite bakery at home in Chico!). After sandwiches we try a new bakery treat (one I've never seen before) called, I think, a Plum Fraid - it is divine! The size of a little muffin bottom, it has an unexpected density. It is the consistency and flavor of a really fine, delicate Macaroon, with a sweet/sour wedge of baked plum in the center. Fabulous! Then, it's on to the campground at the Parakai Aquatic Park. "Aquatic Park?" you may ask, and rightly so. the campground isn't anything special but the Aquatic Park is awesome indeed. It has two hot-spring-fed pools...  oh, and did I mention the FREE waterslide??? After we make camp, we head on over for some big fun!  Sherry, Mike, Sue, Tom and I quickly revert to about 7 years old, runing back up to the top as fast as we slide down to the bottom! After we master the basics, we start getting creative - first trying to catch each other in the tube, then forming up into a train and going down the slide together (this is FAST!) and taking turns going first. Finally after our feet are too sore from runing up on the fake-grass carpet and our bodies are covered with a nice assortment of bruises, we take one last 'go for broke' run. Sherry and I go side by side, with Mike behind us, holding one of each of our feet, with Thom as the caboose. We almost do a roll inside the tube, WAY out of control. We shoot out of the tube like a cannon, with appendages flying in an awesome display of carnage. We are laughing so hard my stomach hurts! The joke is probably on us, though, as we have worked harder (and taken more damage) than on any day of riding so far! After all that, we are pretty wasted. We have a great dinner, Mike and I walk to the Dairy for dessert (Sherry crashes - jetlagged still) and then we sit around in the dark at 7pm, trying to figure out what we are going to do till we can go to bed at 9 (that's the minimum embarassment hour)! What a day! I'll drema waterslides tonight!
We quickly shed our jackets as we start to climb.  Wayne is riding with us, at least briefly, depending on how his back holds up. It is 62 ks to lunch, on an not-too-busy highway, rolling pretty much relentlessly up and up and up.  Every so often we catch a panoramic glimpse of bay and slough (hope the photos we took will capture it!) and then we are whooshing down into the trees once more. We have a bit of a headwind today too so that contributes to making it feel just a little bit harder than it seems like it ought to! After a really nice scenic overlook, we descend into Wellesford for a quick lunch just as it begins to sprinkle. Mike takes the opportunity there to grease my pedal which for some reason chose this morning to begin screeching most unpleasantly! After all our wheel problems, we dread to think that we could have more mechanical trouble, but it turns out that the lube-job pretty much seems to fix whatever the problem was. The pedals are pretty old so I'm hoping they'll just hold out till the end of the trip! After lunch, we immediately enter the nerve-wracking zone of Hwy 1, a road which, by clever route design by Wayne, we've been able to avoid pretty much completely thus far. Luckily the rain has let up so we aren't getting too wet, but the cars and trucks are driving past us FAST!!! We just try to get through it as quickly as possible, but not as quickly as we'd like. The terrain is pretty challenging, consisting of more endless rollers into the wind.  After only a few close calls with logging trucks and sheep trucks (the WORST - stinky like you wouldn't believe!) we prepare to get off Hwy 1 - only to have our hopes dashed when we realize that we (that would be ME, I admit it!) have misread the map and we still have 8 kms to go! Eventually though, we do finish that unpleasant stretch and, after powering up on Moro Bars and Coke, Mike, Sherry and I tackle the last stretch: 20 kms of rollers (this time with a tailwind!) to a charming Backpackers (The Old Post Office Guesthouse) where we will spend the night tonight (no tent to pitch! A real bed! Wow!). When we arrive, we find that it really was once a Post Office and is now filled with wonderful gardens from front to back. The owner is out on an errand so we finish the descent into Paparoa, which turns out to be a VERY small town (grocery, dairy, 2 cafes and an antique store) but nice! It's easy to waste an hour here and the time flies by. Soon we saddle back up and SLOWLY make our way back up the hill to our accommodations. We are sharing 4 to a room so it's a bit crowded, but wonderful to sleep in a bed and gardens are a real treat! We finish the night off with popcorn and TV in the 'Library'. A great, big day! 
We have a nice leisurely breakfast today, in anticipation of a short, relatively flat and easy day. With around 60 kms in front of us and no camp to break, we can afford to relax alittle! Eventually though, it's time to get on the bikes and go. Just before we leave, we discover that Sherry's brand of sunscreen is a real mosquito magnet! She and I are both swarmed with mosquitos immediately after applying it... arrgh! A crude but effective motivator to get moving! Around 8 kms out, we have a 'scheduled stop' highly recommended by Wayne and Sue, the Kauri Museum in Maungaturoto (say THAT 5 times fast!), it's supposed to give us some perspective on the native-growth stand of Kauri that we're going to ride through tomorrow - as well as on the way this tree has shaped the lives and economy of the entire Northlands. The Kauri is the second-largest tree in the world (after the Giant Sequoia in California, USA) and it was key in the lives of the Mauri as well as in the early settling of NZ by white man.  Aside from the unique and truly spectacular nature of the tree, it was valued both for lumber and for an amber substance called "Kauri Gum" which would ooze from wounds and then harden over a 6 month period. It was used from about 1860 to 1940 for the production of varnish and linoleum, in addition to being used as a carving medium for art, jewelry  and tourist trinkets. Originally, the Mauri used it for coloring their tattooes, which were used to reflect the individual's status and position within their community. The story of the Kauri is probably a pretty typical tale of human exploitation of resources... with an added twist of conflicting purposes between the gum-diggers and the lumberers. The gum collectors initially just picked pieces of gum off the trees but when that was depleted they figured out that they could cut the tree ('bleed it', it was called) then come back in 6 months and collect the hardened gum. Meanwhile the lumberers were cutting the trees with reckless abandon, in quantities that seem unbelievable to our modern eyes, and with tools that seem shockingly primitive. Conveniently, the bleeding of the trees would eventually kill them, freeing them for use as lumber. As the trees started to become more scarce, some lucky or inquisitive person discovered that there were many Kauri buried in the local swamps and they could be dug up, revealing great lumps of Kauri gum to be had for the taking (and by great I do mean great - some of the carvings in the museum came from discreet pieces that must have been 3 cubic feet in size - amazing!), pumping new life into the Kauri gum industry. Apparently, at some point in the 1950s or so, someone came to their senses and realized that almost all the Kauri of any significant size were gone (these trees can live to be 3000 years old and older), and the government passed laws making it illegal to cut down any living Kauri - or to collect any gum from one. The few native stands of Kauri remaining are considered to be national treasures, and the gum and Kauri lumber both are part of the NZ heritage. All Kauri items made/sold today come from reclaimed Kauri buried in swamps for over 50,000 years.  The museum turns out to be both fascinating and immense. We spend close to 2 hours there, even trying to hurry! There is just a huge amount of stuff, thoughtfully displayed in historical vignettes shoing the felling of trees, operational versions of all the field milling and transporting equipment and devices as well as a reproduction of an actual mill, complete with operating equipment. They also featured displays of bush-clearing (both with oxen teams and the tractor that obsoleted them, equal in power to 115 ox), Kauri gum collecting (off trees in the bush and in swamps), washing, and polishing, and a huge display of Kauri gum art. Finally there was a reproduction of the rooms of a NZ home from the period of about 1900 (parlor, bedrooms, kitchen, dining room, sitting room, library) and even a display of antique dolls! Finally we tear ourselves away and get back to the business at hand. We saddle up and, after a few more rollers we slog through the 40 kms or so of dead-flat river delta land (with a headwind of course!) to Dargaville, another charming tourist town, this one pretty good-sized, for lunch.   After lunch and a quick stop at the grocery store, we head out for the last 15 kms or so to Baylys (say: Baileys!) Beach, a pretty beach community (couldn't be more than 150 houses, one holiday park, one restaurant and one dairy!) set into the side of the hills overlooking the ocean. Since it's a short day, Sherry and I gird up and go for a 'run' on the beach. We're gone for about 45 minutes but probably actually run for less than 20... still, not too bad for my first time running in months and months! Then it's back to camp for showers and dinner... and a walk to the "Funky Fish Cafe" for dessert! Check out the photo of the bathroom, it is, like a few other things we've seen here, "World famous in NZ!"  We even get a nice sunset view of the ocean and beach on teh way back to camp, what a way to end a beautiful day! 
By the time we set out, the sky is already clouding over (how does that happen so quick?), enough so that I grab a jacket to take with me on the bike, just in case. The first 10 km or so is a backtrack of yesterday, fighting a good headwind the whole way. then we are back on Hwy 12, continuing north, enjoying a somewhat more favorable wind. We'll be on this road all day, till we reach tonight's campground in Omapere (O-ma-piri). It's on the left. Hard to go wrong with navigational challenges like this! The next 40 kms flow by, relatively effortlessly. We have a nice cross-tailwind and the traffic is next to non-existent. Scenery is rolling hills of lush green with lots of big trees and lots of underbrush in between. Occasionally we'll get a glimpse of ocean, just to keep our interest. Mike thinks this is easier riding than yesterday's dead-flat 40kms... that was monotonous where this is ever-changing and beautiful. We have a quick lunch at a cafe along the way, saving our 'van stop' for the upcoming Kauri Tree site! Immediately after lunch, the terrain gets quite a bit more challenging as we embark on the first of 3 promised 'decent' climbs! The first two are gradual, the first out in open courntry with lots of cows and sheep to visit along the way, and lots of false summits to throw us off-guard.  Then we have a great descent down into a Preserve Area (kind of like our National Forest) that is just loaded with growth - groundcover, several layers of understory trees of varying heights and finally, above it all, the mighty Kauri stands, guarding their last domain. Most of the trees must be around 5-8 ft in diameter so we know they aren't very old (at least in Kauri terms!). In our enthusiasm to see the trees (and exhilaration from the awesome descent?), we allow Bob to lead us a few kms down a dirt road to a visitor center where there actually aren't any Kauri - oops! But there's a bathroom and a great gift shop and a ranger who visits with us for awhile and helps us identify our favorite morning bird calls... Apparently they are Tui! So, it wasn't a total waste! We make our way back to the road and begin our second climb, 9 kms of winding, gentle ascent through jungle that slowly changes to higher country bush as we begin to wonder wheter we will ever climb our way to the top!  Finally it levels out for a few kms and then we are at the pull-out for Tuma Makuta, the 'lord of all trees' - the largest tree in NZ. It's a few minute's walk through the bush (jungle is what I'd call it!) till we round a corner and there it is - wow! I know our photos won't do it justice, at all... but we tried! Totally amazing... and even more amazing to me is the thought of how much bigger the biggest trees were before they were annihilated. It defies the imagination!  Humorously (to me anyway), near the tree is a small, polite sign asking people to show proper respect for the tree by refraining from playing music, chanting or other ceremonial behaviors... classic NZ! After viewing its majesty for a few mintues, we need to get back on the bike - the cloud cover that's been haunting us on and off all day has returned with a vengeance and it is too cold and damp to sit around!  We head out with Sherry and Wayne for a bit more climbing (not climb number 3, that's still to come!), followed by an awesome technical descent out of the jungle and back into civilization and a great stretch of pretty, relatively flat road befire we tackle the last hill, a short but STEEP climb that tests out our lowest gear for the first time on the trip! We regroup for photos at the top, then careen down the hill to Omapere and the hotel that hosts our campsites. We are onthe beach - a harbor that stretches for miles. Fabulous!
The weather today is alternatign sun, cloud, mist, rain, cloud, sun, repeat on about a 1 hour schedule. We eventually have breakfast (in a comedy of errors, the expensive hotel buffet offering is stingy and extremely limited in variety and the take-away place is about an hour late in opening so we end up cooking in the grim little kitchen and eating on the steps (there's no table... perhaps to motivate campers to use the restaurant???) feeling a bit like refugees as teh garbage man drives up and sends clouds of diesel fumes our way - sometimes things just WON'T go our way! After breakfast, Mike works on the bike and I sit and read some more in the lounge (it really is a most pleasant and inviting room, in a wonderful old hotel building!), just enjoying the refreshing experience of doing nothing! Around noon, we saddle up the bike for a quick ride to the next town, Opononi, just to stretch out our legs - they're pretty tight from yesterday's climbing! It's about 5 km, pretty, rolling scenery along a wide river mouth with a huge sand dune on the other side. In Opononi, we find a great Fish and Chips place that is cooking fresh fish, right off the fishing boat - yum!  After lunch and a quick ride back to camp, I hit the grocery store and then read (more!) till it's time for a hike out to the headlands with Wayne, Sue and Sherry. Spectacular views abound, hope I can get the photos in here. On the way back we run into Allan and Susan - holding hands! Looks like a vacation romance! Another nice and easy dinner from the take-away next door (burgers this time, they're out of fish!) and another evening to kill. We are really noticing the time change... it gets dark now around 7pm, way too early to go to sleep! There's a rumor of a slide show by Wayne and Sue on the South Island, don't want to miss it. Tomorrow - back to the bike!
We're energized from our relaxing day off and ready to go! Under cloudy skies with the threat of rain we set off.  Mike and I are riding alone because Sherry wasn't ready to go and the mosquitos were biting. We have a beautiful stretch of quiet road to cover this morning. We start out along the south side of Hokianga Harbor (an amazingly long body of water), heading 'upstream'. The lush green terrain rolls along and so do we, slowing a bit on the ups and making it up on the downs...  There are a couple of bigger hills to wake up our legs but it's mostly just a pelasant cruise. This is what cycle-touring is all about! About 20 kms into the ride we make a turn and head towards the Rawene ferry, which will take us to the north side of the harbor (we later learn that if you miss the ferry it's about 70 kms further to get around to the north side of the harbor). The ferry runs every hour on the half hour, so of course Mike and I arrive at 9:38, just in time to see the ferry pulling away. It turns out ok, though, as it gives Mike a chance to check out the local cafe. He even has a capuccino - what are we coming to?? I also sneak in a quick visit to The Clendon House (a National Historical Place). It was built in the 1860s by a shipbuilder for his 'beautiful young Maori wife', who had the improbable name of Jane. The house is very cool, filled with the original family possessions. By the time an hour has sped by, most of the gang has arrived - Sue with the van, Bob, Wayne, Ed and Thom - Allan and Susan ride up just at the last minute and decide to have coffee and wait for the next ferry. Oddly enough, Sherry has not appeared! We figure she is just behind Susan because she was taking alot of photos so we don't give it much thought.  The ferry is crowded (after all it's Saturday!) but fast and short. After, we hit the road for an ablolutely fabulous stretch of road. We get a few light showers (almost more of a mist than a rain, actually kind of refreshing!) and one minor climb and then a FAST rolling downhill stretch through a long valley into lunch. More awesome cycling! During lunch, we get to see a real, live cattle drive, right down the main road through the center of town, up close and personal (as you will see from the photos)! It is quite a carnival, with about 75 head of cow (they are BIG!), 4 or 5 dogs, a few guys on horseback, an ATV and a truck. Quite a sight! What we don't see, however, is Sherry! Allan and Susan haven't shown up by the time we leave the lunch stop, but still we are beginning to wonder what might have happened to her - we know she can ride pretty fast when she needs to! As we're riding, we speculate on where she might be... there's not much else we can do! The afternoon is a it more challenging (more uphill, that is!), and our comfortable cloud-cover dissipates, so it gets quite hot! Mike and I are feeling pretty good, though, so we go to work a bit, towards the end of the day. When we get into town we head to the campground but don't see Wayne, so after a drink from the Dairy (Mike's new thing is called a "Wave", it's flavored milk drink that's pretty darn tasty! I like the coffee flavor, personally!), we go back into town to see what's up. We find Wayne heading BACK to the campground so we do a 'speedy shop' at the Pak and Save and buy just enough to make us a hazard on the road, carrying the groceries!  By this time, we've heard that Sherry didn't make the ferry... and that Allan passed her but Susan never did. So we are pretty sure that she missed the turn to the ferry! Most likely, she's looking at that 70km detour I mentioned earlier!  After we set up camp, the speculating really begins. Wondering what to do, we start considering options. We do some calculating and figure out that if she had to do the whole 70 km extra, she would probably arrive by 6pm. We decide that if we don't see her by then, we'll call the police and start to go out and look for her. Worst case scenarios are starting to flip through all of our minds as we each share our 'most ridiculously lost' stories to fill the minutes until at last, right on schedule at 5:40, she arrives. She is in good spirits and has lots of stories... and she's racked up two big titles in one day: Most Kilometers Travelled in One Day - 170km! and biggest detour, surpassing Allan, and Mike and I respectively! All's well that ends well, and another great day! 
We get on the bus at 9am (they come to the campground to pick us up, no extra charge, a nice touch), loaded down with cameras, food, swimsuits, binoculars and high spirits!  It's a short trip of 10 km to our first stop, the Kauri 'museum', which has some fabulous pieces, from small as keychains to complete dining sets that start at $4000NZ. The real showpiece is a truly remarkable spiral staircase cut into a single upright standing Kauri log. I took a photo, hope it turns out! Almost all of us succumb to temptation and buy a piece or two. All of the merchandise here is recovered from nearby swamps where it has been resting ro 45,000 plus years... we even get to see some of the newly-recovered stumps sitting in the lot, waiting to be cleaned and used. Amazing! Then, after our allotted 15 minute visit, it's off to the Gum-Digger World, which turns out to be a charmingly informal (and not at all commercial) 'attraction'. It is a once-abandoned family farm where the the remnants of the by-gone era of gum-digging lie asleep in the fallow fields. Our host, by trade a farmer, discovered this buried treasure in his wife's family 'closet'. A disarmingly low-key guy, he initiated a co-operative effort  with the University of Auckland and several other New Zealand schools, to excavate and restore the site to its original working state.  The University became interested in studying the Kauri buried here for its insight into climatogical (? Climate!) research. The Kauri here (there are 3 layers!) date from 45,000 to 150,000 and possibly more years ago. Because the layers are relatively undisturbed (perhaps the only place that remains so!), they can learn alot about how (and why?) each layer of forest migh have thrived and ultimately died (the Kauri takes 2000 years to come to maturity).  We get to see replicas of Gum-Digger shanties (we took photos), minimal in comfort and security, whether made from grasses, burlap bags or bamboo, and of their work environment where they cleaned, polished and sorted the Kauri gum they found (and lots of samples of various types and quality levels), as well as the actual holes made by the diggers 50-100 years ago, which gave the field a strange resemblance to a booby-trapped mine field!  They dug square holes and round holes... big (20 ft diameter) holes and little (4 ft diameter) holes. All of the holes go down about 8-10 ft through soil that is just a step above the consistency of cement! Those guys were tough. Makes us feel pretty wimpy, just riding our bikes all day! Soon, though, we are herded into our bus and on our way to the Wagener Museum, which is set in an absolutely gorgeous environment (as you will see from the photo). Mike and I skip the museum but really enjoy the views of the bay and the delicious fresh coastal air. After the museum we have a fairly long and, toward the end, exhilarating, ride to Tapotupotu (say THAT 5 times fast!) for lunch, which turns out to be the only disappointment of the day... a wafer-think slice of ham on a rol with a few slivers of lettuce, hardboiled egg and grated cheese, as well as a chocolate chip muffin. We get our choice of a cup of orange drink, instant coffee or tea. Bleah!  Luckily the disappointment is short-lived, as we get over it by jumping into the perfect waves on the perfect beach! There's a pretty strong rip current here so we stay safely near shore... but the wave-jumping is awesome nevertheless!  There are even showers, toilets and changing-rooms... NZ rocks! Soon our allotted 45 minutes is up so we regretfully board the bus for more wild driving. The road into and out of Cape Reinga is incredibly narrow, steep and winding. It is amazing watching the bus drivers whip their vehicles up and down the hills, passing each other with just inches to spare. I am SOO glad there are next to no cars up here, it would be too scary to add them to the mix! Cape Reinga, a windswept point of coastal land, is where the Pacific and Tasman meet. It is considered by the Maori to be a place of great power, and it is easy to see why. The ocean and the sea meet in a churning, boiling, blurring line of chaos, threatening to tear apart anything that strays too close. In Maori culture, Cape Reinga is believed to be the last stopping place for the spirits of the dead, before they make their final voyage to Polynesia (Reinga actually translates as 'the leaping place').  By now our bus driver is really loosening up and he shares a few Maori chants and songs with us as we approach, to help us understand the importance of the place we are approaching. At this point the road has become positively precipitous. Words cannot even convey how spectacular and unspoiled this place is... you just have to come here yourself to experience it!  My only regret is that we have such a short amount of time to spend here. I really wish we could have ridden our bikes and stayed for awhile! Cape Reinga itself is beautiful, and its famous lighthouse quite fun. In our alloted 30 minutes we manage to hike down to the lighthouse and get a photo under the street sign to share with you all, as well as to hike a ways down the other side towards the original lighthouse which was replaced some years ago, and to mail ourselves a postcard (it gets a special Cape Reinga stamp). In a bit of irony, right after Sherry and I photographed each other mailing our postcards, OUR BUSDRIVER walks up with a key and a bag, and empties out the mailbox! This guy does everything!  It's a short trip back out and over to Te Paki Stream where we stop off for some Sand Dune tobogganing. It is WAY out of control. A couple of folks perform some awesome face-plants and other heroic dives, but luckily Mike and I emerge relatively unscathed. We have to agree though, that good as it is, it's not QUITE as good as the waterslides (and it's a heck of a lot more work climbing up those dunes!). After we've had our fill (at least 10 runs!) we get back on board, winded and content, and continue along the Te Paki river bed and on to 90-mile beach. Turns out the river bed and the beach are both such hard-packed sand that, most times, thy are more solid than a gravel road! And, the Department of Conservation monitors the area carefully and only allows tours to go when it's safe (for the environment, that is! Our safety is completely 'at our own risk'!). On the beach, we speed along at 80 km/hr (about 50 mi/hr) but still have time to see a cool island with a tunnel through it (got a photo), wild horses (there's a herd of about 400 here still!) and a brief rainstorm in the distance followed by a terrific rainbow. Eventually we wind up 'home', tired and satisfied! Another full day! But, one day of tour bus is plenty enough for me - I'm ready to get back on the bike! Terrific as it was, I found myself wishing I could have had more time to hike and look and experience the moments in the day... that's what *I* get from bike touring that I just don't seem to get from other forms of travel! 
We wake to sunnny skies - a beautiful morning - but the wind is still coming from the east (unusual for here, they say, and now less than fortunate for us!) as it has for the last week or so. We're looking at a headwind pretty much all day today, on the moderately busy Hwy 10.  On the upside, later in the day we are also going to be passing through some absolutely beautiful beach frontage on a lightly travelled road, and staying at Wayne's favorite campsite in ALL of NZ, north AND south island! The first 20 or so kms are just hard work, grinding away at the flat road, riding right into the wind.  Then, as we approach our lunch stop in Mangonui (a very cute, very LITTLE tiny fishing town!), the hills start to get steeper and more frequent adn the scenery more and more spectacular. Already I can see a resemblance to the terrain we remember from Coromandel Peninsula (also on the east coast) at the very beginning of our trip - we are coming full-circle back to where we began.  The hills are hard but on the other hand they do give us alittle protection from the headwind, a welcome relief! W ahve a long lunch break in Mangonui (we beat the van by about a half-hour, so Mike gets a much-appreciated chance to watch the fishermen casting their lines off the pier - see the photo) and the fishing boats coming in with their hauls. Eventually, though, we realize it is time to set out... and so we are off. The afternoon starts off flat but quickly turns into a long series of fairly easy short inland hills, curving to the left and then to the right. Clouds have set in, and we are no longer riding dead into the wind, making the conditions quite pleasant for cycling.  It seems like we are leaving the more populated and 'touristy' areas further behind with every pedal stroke further away from Hwy 1 - Hooray!  Each town is smaller, older and a bit more charmingly run-down than the last. For the last 15 kms or so, we turn off Hwy 10 onto a really isolated secondary road which starts out with a climb, then a quick descent, steeper climb followed by an even quicker descent and finally a real killer uphill. We are feeling pretty good now that we are out of the wind for awhile and the only sound that competes with our measured breathing as we climb is the overwhelming serenade of the cicadas in the surrounding underbrush. After the last climb and a wonderful descent, we have 3 easy kms, blessedly flat and relatively wind-free, into camp. We weave our way between more hills and suddenly we have arrived in another wonderful little beachside community of maybe 100 houses and our motorcamp - no stores at all.  We camp right on the beach, and we have the place virtually to ourselves. What a wonderful campground! The beach even looks perfect for swimming, which it turns out to be, as you will see from the photo. The water is a bit cold but clear and safe. Sherry and I are even able to put on our goggles and actually do some real swimming!  Before dinner, Sue invites me out for a little walk to the next cove, a secluded little spot where someone has built an absolutely wonderful beach house complete with a koi pond with lilies and a footbridge, and an extensive rock garden with whimsical statues scattered about. To get there, we walk through some natural arches that the waves have carved into the rocky cliffs that line the beach here. The place is just magical, as I hope the photos will show! Mike, Sherry and I have another wonderful dinner, agreed by all to be the best curry dish we've cooked so far!  As always, we all eat way too much. I'm starting to be worried to see what I'm going to weigh when I get back to a scale! I know I haven't lost weight on THIS trip! I know I'm getting stronger (I'm asking Mike for harder gears on hills, more and more often!) but I'm not getting any smaller! Not that I was trying to lose weight, but I really didn't plan on GAINING on the trip, either!  Mike got to the point of being tired of eating in the last few days! Said he knew he needed to eat but he just couldn't take any more snacks. Believe me, this is a FIRST!!! Eating to ride every day can become alot of work, in itself! 
We get off to a fairly late start, but we're not too concerned since it's rumored to be a fairly short (65 km) day. Turns out to be a short but far from easy day, though, as the first 10 kms out of camp are on a road that is both extremely steep (up AND down) and completely torn up, in the process of re-paving. Right after we get back onto pavement, we are confronted by yet another extremely steep hill - our littlest gear is getting quite a workout today! After 17 kms we have logged 1700 ft! That is definitely an all-time climbing record for Mike and I. Hurt me! Actually though, it hurt those with road-bike gearing alot more than it hurt us with our low gears!   After we get through the hilly part, we get back on the main road (Hwy 10) which has less hills, less scenery and alot more (and faster!) traffic, for a seemingly eternal stretch (our good friend Mr Headwind keeping us company!) into the lunch stop at Kerikeri, at 51 kms. Looks like it's going to be more than 65 kms today!  At lunch (at possibly the best bakery we've visited in NZ, Kerikeri Bakery, YUM!), it begins to sprinkle and then to rain pretty good. Back to the van for raingear, lucky for us that the van is nearby! By the time we are finally ready to get on the bike (after a quick pit-stop at the nicest McDonalds - wood-panelled, even the bathrooms!), the rain has, of course, pretty much stopped. Well, better safe than sorry! The last 25 kms alternate hills and headwinds, just so we don't get bored, as we make our way slowly to Paihia, where we are to catch a ferry to Russell. We have lots of time to kil before the van will arrive in camp (this ferry is pedestrian only, the auto ferry is further down the coast), so we all waste some time (and $$$!) in Paihia - it's the local center of tourism and alot more frenetic than our destination of Russell, which is more of a sleepy community. After ice cream and lattes (see the photo if you don't believe me!), wine shopping and souvenier shopping, we finally make our way on board a ferry and head over to Russell. Apparently Russell once was a pretty wild town, but you'd never know it today. After the hubbub and hawksters in Paihia (Motorboating! Sailing! Cruising! Fishing! ATV'ing! Kayaking! Sailing in a bigger boat! Fishing for a bigger fish! Half-day trips! Full-day trips! Weekend-long trips!), the sleepy ambiance of Russell is quite a relief. Our campsite is nice enough (though not too close to the beach - see how spoiled we are getting!), but, it turns out, not too 'sleepy' tonight. There's a school group with 25 or so kids (maybe age 8-12 or so) sharing the campground with us! Pretty funny to watch the interactions between our two groups... but they seem like nice enough kids!   At and after dinner, the topic of conversation is all about what to do with two whole days off - hiking, sailing or fishing seem to be the top possibilities. We all turn in early in preparation for adventure to come.
We get quite a bit of rain (it seems to come in waves that last about 45 minutes) in the morning so we mostly just hunker down in the kitchen/common room which luckily is pretty large and comfortable. Sharing it with 25 wound-up kids isn't quite how we had planned to spend our first day here though! By noon we are all getting a case of cabin-fever and we are ready to escape from our cozy prison. Luckily it clears up into quite a nice afternoon and Mike and I manage to see most of the highlights of Russell including the museum, Department of Conservation (basically a nature center), the Police Station (which is a truly wonderful building as you will see from the photo) and a mission that is supposed to be the second oldest building in New Zealand. Later we walk over to Long Beach (about an hour round trip) and we even squeeze in a bit of shopping, and find time for dinner and dessert out! We have tentative plans for fising and sailing tomorrow if the weather should continue to improve. Otherwise we are doomed, rats trapped on a sinking, rainy ship of despair!
5 inches of rain was forecast and we got at LEAST that much. Standing water everywhere. A couple of tents have collapsed (luckily not ours!) in the raging wind, and ALL the tents are leaking to some degree. It's going to be a long night! And what will tomorrow bring?
Last night was the worst night of our trip! I had thought that the worst of the storm might be overbut it was just hiding out... waiting till we got back in our tent for the night before it unleashed its next salvo. The wind was whipping the trees from side to side and trying its best to turn our tent inside out (and doing a pretty good job of it, too!). The tent was leaking from various points by that time as well. Altogether it added up to a pretty much sleepless night. We occupied ourselves by watching the tent poles flex as the wind would hit them and then SNAP back into position after the wind let up - exciting! In the light of dawn (we are glad to be freed from our watery prison), it looks like it might possibly clear up - for a few minutes. By 7am, though, the wind has picked up and the rain has begun to fall with a vengeance from the darkened skies. Now we know why it is so green here!  The field where we're camped is carrying about an inch or two of standing water, making it impossible to keep our shoes dry, even venturing out on the shortest trip, from the tent to the toilets and showers. More and more of our stuff is getting wet and we are turning into quite a sorry, soggy crew! The main worry of riding today is the wind... it is blowing savagely and our route is on busy Highway 1 for much of the day. The rest of the day is on a narrow, very steep and winding up-and-down-hill sort of road which is subject to flooding, our secondary concern. So, as a group, we make the difficult but safer decision to use the van to shuttle us all to Whangarei rather than cycling. Wayne can only take half of us at a time and we lose the coin-toss, so it's Bob, Ed, Sue and Thom in the first load, and then Mike, Sherry, Susan and I in the second trip. We're basically stranded here in Russell till around 1 or 2pm, when Wayne gets back... so there's a certain sense of poetic justice in the air when the clouds unleash yet another big load of rain on 'the boys' as they are breaking camp and stowing all their stuff! While we are waiting for Wayne Mike and I manage to get our tent down and, using the clothes dryer in the laundry room, we are able to get almost everything pretty much dry. Sherry uses the time to go for a nice long run, but I am lacking in ambition to accompany her! I might have forgotten to mention this earlier, but Allan is leaving the group here (or rather we are leaving him!). He's staying in NZ for another month, looking for work in this area at a farm-stay. Shortly before Wayne arrives, Susan shows up (she and Allan were downtown) to let us know that she's decided to stay in Russell for a few more days and take the bus to Auckland.         "...There's magic in the air..." When Wayne shows up, he's bringing both another rainstorm and some REALLY bad news. The Sue-Mobile is in jeopardy! The alternator seems to be going out, which throws a real wrench in the plans for the next (last!) 3 days of the tour. And of course it is just on the cusp of the weekend which means we can forget any kind of local service till Monday (at least). There are some long faces in the van as we head to Whangarei to deliver the bad news to 'the A group'.  After some speedy consideration of options and possibilities, Wayne and Sue pull together an alternate plan. They will rent the biggest car they can get and, While Wayne nurses the van back to Auckland, Sue will use the car to support us in riding the final few days. If we all reorganize our bags and just bring the minimum with us, we will even have room for our food bins!  We'll make it work out somehow!  While all this is getting arranged, I manage to slip out for a little run. Sue sends me out in search of a trail beside a river just outside our campground, which I find and am delighted with! Filled with tropical foliage, laden with wet remains from the storm (it hasn't rained now for about 2 hours!) the park is a haven for Silverferns (the national plant) and Kauri trees amongst many others! Best of all, I can actually run, pretty consistently, the whole rolling out-and-back trail, for about 40 minutes! A triumph! After, a few of us pile into the rental car (already nicknamed 'the stealth van') and get a ride downtown (and about a mile DOWNHILL!). After a quick stop at Pack and Save, Mike and I begin what turns out to be an interminable search for a place to have dinner. Whangarei is a pretty big town but it is like a ghost-town. Friday night at 6pm and every restaurant is closed. Every store seems to be closed. Weird! After walking and walking, we finally fina a chinese place with good food and unfortunately terrible service. Oh well! Then it's a long walk uphill to camp but we don't get lost, hooray! No bonus miles! Did I mention that today is my birthday??? What a crazy day!
Eventually, we do manage to get all the stuff we need into the car. There's even room for the cooler! It is extra-great to get on the bike today, snatching a ride from the jaws of mechanical disaster, and so we set off with light hearts. Our legs are a bit heavy, though as we haven't been on the bike in 3 whole days! The route through town is made treacherous by a good-sized construction zone where all the street-signs seem to have disappeared. But we muddle through, and with some help from good luck we end up on the right road out of town! The first half of the day is on Hwy 1 but it's relatively pleasant! Not too much traffic (and very few trucks) as it's saturday, a wide shoulder, forgiving rolling terrain, and eventually, even a tailwind! The miles fly by and after 40 kms we are off Hwy 1 for the rest of the day, and onto a network of small side roads that approach and depart the coast - beautiful! Hillier but well worth the extra effort. At the planned lunch stop town, we don't see a store or dairy so we just keep on going. After a brisk climb, we arrive in the next town, Mangawhi Heads, where we find a store and so stop fora break. 60 kms done, abut 35 to go! In quick succession, we see Wayne in the van and Sue in the Stealth Van each go by (we're pretty well hidden off the main road so they don't see us). Then a bit later, as we pause to consider our route, Bob, Sherry, Ed and then Thom all pull up. We're a bit stumped by the map but assisted by a sweet woman who points out the way. On learning that we're Americans, she tells us that her granddaughter is going to be an exchange student in Madison WI and asks if it is a 'safe place'. I reassure her as best I can about the relative safety of Madison and the 'heartland' in general, much to her relief!  Soon (after a 'coffee donut' at the adjacent bakery), we are back on our way for the beautiful 30 kms or so into Wellesford. The scenery here (as in a few other spots in the Northland) looks remarkably similar to Hobbiton from The Lord of the Rings... charming! Our last 8 kms is back on busy Hwy 1, retracing our route (in reverse) from 10 days ago. Today, though, we have sun and no headwind and it is much more pleasant!  We stay in a really charming motel (our first true motel) with amazing gardens of succulents and cacti, annuals, perennials, fruit trees, flowering trees, grasses, shrubs, bushes and ferns, all arranged with paths and garden art and arbors with a whimsy that makes the result simply enchanting.  Inside, each room is actually a suite, with a fully furnished kitchen, including coffee, tea and fresh milk. Sue says this is typical of a NZ motel - we'd be awed just by the fresh towels and complimentary soaps!  Sue herself is up for special honors tonight. Not only did she take care of our stuff today (when we arrived at the motel, Sue was gone but we found all our things delivered into our respective rooms) but she then went on and followed Wayne all the way in to Auckland, to make sure he arrived without further incident. Then she turned around and drove all the way back to Wellesford so she could carry our stuff around for the next (last!) two days of cycling! She arrives just before dinner which we luckily have enough of to feed her and a surprise - her favorite chocolate bar is waiting on her pillow, a small gift of appreciation from her little elves. After two bottles of wine at dinner, we all go outside to tour the motel grounds at sunset. This is just another of the things we would never see at home - an ordinary motel in the middle of an ordinary town, cared for to an immaculate level of loving detail that our American minds just can't get over and our spirits just delight in! We all take alot of photos as we wander around amazed! Primed with wine, we stage an impromptu 'end of trip' party, taking over 'the boys room' (our room has been dubbed 'Mike's harem'!) for the occasion. Everyone finds something to contribute as we try to use up and unload the last of our goodies... Mike brings out a gallon of Tip-Top ice cream (Chocolate Eclair!) that he picked up at the market earlier (the rooms have refrigerators!), Sherry and I pop up the last of my popcorn (using Ed's butter) and Bob pulls out some beers. They even have found a birthday card, candle and wrapped up a gag gift for me! We all share the goodies while watching a movie (yes, the motel even has a satellite!) called 'Cats and Dogs' starring Jeff Goldblum - one of those movies that's so bad it's funny! After alot of laughs and a wonderful evening, we stagger back to our room at the grand late hour of 10:00 - great fun! 
Today's ride is on Hwy 16 till lunch (more 'rewind' of the miles we did, this time from Day 39) from Wellesford to Kauapakapaka. Hillier than we expectit to be, the route just keeps onrolling, with alot of up! Mike isn't having a great day today (in fact eventually he names this the worst-feeling day of the trip!), he says is legs are dead. Wonder why...  maybe it was that wild party last night! We work pretty hard just getting to lunch and then after lunch, with some dread, we separate from the main road to take a more direct and scenic but even MORE hilly route!  The hilly route turns out to be no worse, really, than the busy road was. By now, the worst part is the humidity! We have a tailwind so no breeze at all on the uphills. Just stagnant hot humid air.  On a brighter note, we are travelling through beautiful neighborhoods of upscale country homes, with gorgeous landscaping and well-kept horses grazing in teh fields. At one point, we even ride through a grove of silverferns! My first road-side sighting of one!  We cross Hwy 16 once more to head out to Muriwai Beach, 9 perilous kms down a really busy road... possibly the busiest road we've been on in the entire trip! Almost no shoulder and just *crazy* traffic on a mission to get to and from the beach!  The beach, when we get there, IS worth the trauma. We take a 30 minute self-guided tour around a Gannet colony. The Gannet, as you'll see from our photos, is a striking bird. The signs along the walk give us quite a bit of information about their breeding, habits, and lifecycle. Their first flight is direct from NZ to Australia!! They stay at least 2 years, and then return to NZ. Only 25% make it back alive. Those that do, return to precisely where they were born, where they mate for life. Their flight is unbelievably graceful - their wingspan is probably 4-5 ft - but they are not too coordinated in landing. We see one adult do a total faceplant!   After the Gannet tour, we all jump into the ocean (even Mike!) which is quite rough - lots of surfers and lots of 'warning - undertow, riptides' signs!  We are careful but we have a ball jumping the waves and doing a bit of (very amateur) body surfing. Definitely the roughtest surf we've been in! I could stay for hours but I have to be careful about sunburn! One more fun group dinner and then it's time to call it a day... I can't believe it's so close to being over!
We've found a series of back roads which we can take direct to the train station, making the morning's ride as scenic and traffic-free as possible. We decide to stay together and ride as a group as we don't all have the detailed maps that show the complete route.  We have quite a climb (about 2 km) right out of the gate this morning. It's hardest on Sherry, who can't figure out why she's *dying* until Thom points out that she's still in her BIG RING, about half-way up the hill! We all get a pretty good laugh out of that! Eventually we do get to the top, and then it's a nice rolling downhill till we turn off and onto our backroad route. Sue, having gone ahead in the car, is waiting at the turn for us so we can't miss it! The route turns out to be delightful - plenty of rolling hills but not too much climbing. The landscape is wonderfully green and immaculately landscaped. It seems we are back in 'civilization' and have stumbled into one of the nicest neighborhoods we've seen on the trip! We are so close to Auckland, it must be a 'bedroom community' for upscale commuters. Each house is prettier than the last - and most come with a full complement of sleek, well-kept horses, barn and all are surrounded by lovely, lovely grounds. Adding to the enjoyment, Sue is driving ahead to each turnand signalling the (sometimes perplexing!) route to us! She is setting a new standard of service for the trip! The skies are starting to cloud up but before we know it, we are approaching the Swanson train station. Mike and I somehow manage to get ahead of everyone else on the last downhill to the station (we hear Sherry drop her chain on the uphill - maybe that was the reason?). Sue is there at the station and gives us an overview of how to get to the campground from the train station. We hear the train comin but the group still hasn't arrived. We jump on the train and tyr to get the conductor to wait - to no avail! Off we go - just as we see the gang pedalling up. Darn! The train is a bit rickety but quite pleasant. It's a 45 minute ride to downtown Auckland, then a 10 minute wait (with a surprise rainshower!) and then a 30 minute ride to Manukau City. We jump out there and pedal the 10 minutes to the campground, chased by more (and darker) rainclouds, and our cycling in NZ is done for this trip! Finished, before noon! The next 5 hours are a flurry of unpacing, cleaning, laundry, organizing and repacking. We finish with a half-hour to spare. Then we're all off to a final celebration dinner at the buffet (oh boy!) restaurant next door! Check out the photo of our wacky team! What a great group. Of course, we all eat WAY too much (boy was that ham good. And the potatoes! But all the rest pales before the dessert table!).  After, Mike and I meet with our Auckland friends Sergei and Irina, who have generously driven out to the campground one more time, to pick up our packed tandem and keep it safe for us over the next week so we don't have to drag it to the south island (each plane flight is just one more chance for the bike to get smashed up).  On our return in 6 days, Sergei and Irina will bring the bike to the airport to meet us in between our flight from Christchurch and our flight to LA and home. Thank you Sergei and Irina! Finally, after warm goodbyes, we are off to bed - sharing a 'micro-cabin' with Sherry so we don't have to break camp in the morning before our 8am flight to Christchurch! Sue's going to give us a ride to the airport in the Stealth Van, so we don't have to worry about getting a shuttle. Sweet dreams! 
It's freezing and raining when we get off the airplane. Literally 30 degrees colder than in Auckland, WOW! Everyone is staring at Mike in his shorts, and I'm really glad I wore my pants! Bhrrr!  We quickly link up with our rental car, a tiny little white Mazda Familia (looks like a 323 to me!) that we dub 'the white mity-mite'. We are able to fit all our bags and us in the mity-mite, without too much trouble, which is somewhat of a relief, but the mity-mite is not an automatic, which is not so good! We carefully set off, on the wrong side of the road, the shifter on the wrong side of the driver, with some trepidation! We have gloomy skies and wet roads... it's not too hilly but there's lots of wind! The whole day (440 kms) is mostly flat to rolling, with prety but not spectacular scenery. We make it to Nelson but it is a long day. We are so glad to be out of the car! We get a wonderful room at the Paradiso Luxury Motel, definitely the best room of the whole trip. Best mattress, best sleep and best shower for both Mike and I. Awesome! I also find the perfect route for a nice 40 minute run, along the Maitai (no kidding!) River. Uphill and challenging, but wonderful! 
We do find a nice lunch in Greymouth. the scenery overall is pretty but again not that specatular, with the exception of teh Buller River gorge along Hwy 6, which is pretty darn fabulous! We spend the night at Franz Josef, with the plan of hiking around Fox Glacier in the morning. However it clouds up alot at night and so we're hoping it won't rain on us - it's been pretty sunny all day today! We also have a run-in with the infamous sandflies - glad we are staying in a cabin! 
The scenery today is definitely more spectacular than not, and the driving more strenuous. Less milage (372 kms) but it actually takes longer! There are 2 biggish climbs - one just out of Franz Josef, one over Haast Pass - and one insane climb today, over Cardrona Pass from Wanaka to Queenstown. We are not looking forward to that one on a bike! Yow!  After Haast Pass we are really shocked by the change in the climate and scenery as we make our way inland from the west coast. Suddenly it is so dry and barren it is like we were transported to Nevada. On our way to Queenstown, we stop off for a look at Arrowtown, a charming little gold-mining town, where we stretch our tired legs out! Then we are off to our campground not far beyond.
Around noon we set out for Dunedin, our shortest drive so far at 281 kms. The scenery continues to be somewhat barren but striking as we leave Christchurch. Our route takes us along a big river most of the way so that adds beauty to the day. With each mile closer to the east coast we notice the scenery getting just a bit greener and a bit more lush. We have one big climb on Hwy 8, after the town of Beaumont. Our legs are hurting in sympathy for the cyclists we see! However, we remind ourselves, we've done worse climbs on this trip! Dunedin is the biggest city we've driven in yet... a bit traumatic for captain and navigator both! But we eventually find our way to the campground. We really don't have time for the Albatross colony or the penguins, they'll have to wait for next time. I do, though, find time for a quick and delightful trail run from just outside our campground up (the operative word here, believe me!) to the trailhead for the Pineapple Track! 
We start out from Dunedin with a short stop at 'the worlds' steepest street' according to the Guinness Book of World Records! Baldwin St, just outside of Dunedin holds the title, and WOW is it steep. Glad we didn't have to ride it on the tandem! We didn't even try to get the 'Mity Mite' up it... just parked and walked. The photo really doesn't do it justice. Then we're on the road for Christchurch. After a long day of driving (and the fun of navigating through Christchurch to our campground) we head into Christchurch downtown for some souvenier shopping and a last dinner out. We end up at The Tap Room, a micro-brew place that features Monteith's 'craft-brew' beer, where we have a really delicious meal. Mike FINALLY gets the 'traditional' NZ lamb dinner (with mashed spuds and gravy) he's been craving and I have a really delicious vegetarian Thai curry rich with coconut milk. As if that weren't enough, we split a chocolate bread pudding and a decaf latte for dessert - wow. What a way to finish a vacation! More things we missed but would really like to see, next time: Arthur's Pass, Mt Cook, Milford sound and the whole southland, the Otago Peninsula near Dunedin, Oameru, the Christchurch surrounding area and last but certainly not least, the spectacular TranzAlpine railroad trip from Christchurch to Greymouth and back. So much to see! Can't wait to come back here and explore some more. After circling the island, we definitely agree with Wayne's assessment of the terrain. The Southern Alps notwithstanding, the cycling here overall is alot easier than in the North Island. You can ride here for literally days without encountering a major hill... whereas on the North Island, the climbing is pretty much relentless. Not as big of hills but the hills are constant and ever-present. We didn't much like the sandflies but we are going to do some research into the best 'non-toxic' fly repellant before we come back here! 
Our trip to the airport is uneventful, and it is a bit of a relief to return the Mity Mite to the rental car place (Pegasus, if you ever need a car in NZ, the price is right!) safe and sound and no worse for the wear. Before we know it, we're on the airplane to Auckland, where we have a 4 hour lay-over. We meet up with Sergei (Irina couldn't make it due to an appointment) right on time and get our bike. It was so generous of Sergei and Irina to help us out this way! We can't wait to see them in the US and return the favor! Finally, and after a surprising amount of airport security measures, we are on the plane to LA - both excited to be going home and dreading the long 12 hour flight in front of us. Once again, Mike gets the window and I get the center seat... I try not to drive the woman next to us mad with my constant need to get up and stretch my legs! No 'airplane leg syndrome' for me! We get into LA a bit late and then come to pretty much a dead stop. We were hoping to 'breeze' through customs etc with enough time to meet up with Mike's old grade school buddy Mary Ritchie and her husband Gordon for coffee! Unfortunately our baggage must have been in the last 15 pieces unloaded, so we were at the very end of the line. It took forever! We weren't sure we would even make the flight to SFO, let alone have time to visit!  Mary and Gordon were there, patiently waiting, when we emerged from customs, about an hour and a half later than planned! They rushed us over to domestic flights and sent us on our way... Luckily we got a few minutes to chat while getting from Point A to Point B! Hopefully we can manage that a little better next time! For sure we'll arrange a quieter and more relaxed setting for our next get-together! Anyway, it was nice for me to get to meet Mary and for both Mike and I to get to meet Gordon.  Mike and I are pretty much on fumes of adrenalin as we board the flight to SFO. I can't say I remember alot from the flight! At SFO we gather our luggage pretty quickly. While waiting around, we have an odd brush with 'lifestyles of the rich and famous' as it turns out that Pierce Brosnan was on our flight and is sitting around waiting for HIS luggage, right along with us! I almost expected that goofy guy who played his chauffeur on Remington Steel to walk up and take his bag for him... Funny!  Eventually we check in with Tim, who's coming to get us from Chico - Cell phones really are great! Turns out we have enough time to grab a bite to eat - we are starving by this point as we've been going for about 16 hours straight by this point.  We find some humor in the act of scrounging through all our bags and pockets to see if we can find enough American $$$ to buy lunch! Soon enough Tim arrives and we load up... and head for home. Mike and I both somehow manage to stay awake the whole time. We arrive at home around 6pm Chico time - our total 'day' of travel was 26 hours... and it is STILL sunday! Mind-bending!  Mike and I wander around the house, cottage and yard in a stupor for awhile, picking up pieces of mail and setting them back down, playing aimlessly with the cat, checking in on the computer, till we finally just collapse into bed and sleep the sleep of the truly exhausted.  We are home. 
Our first few days back were a bit of a shock... remembering how to drive a car (me) and remembering to drive on the right side of the road (Mike), buying american groceries in american stores, jumping back into yoga teaching (me) and going back to work at the bike shop (Mike). And possibly the worst blow of all - getting back on our single bikes and trying to transition our habituated muscles back to our road bikes!  The first ride we went on was on our road tandem and it was pretty terrible. It was the day after we got back so we probably had some jet-lag, too - but everything just felt WRONG! Next we each rode our single bikes and that was pretty terrible too... maybe just because we thought we'd come back so strong and fit, it was a cruel reality-check to discover just how much different our positions were on the Mtn Tandem - and just how much difference that made in our ability to access all those new muscles we developed! Probably the week off, sitting in the car, didn't help much either.  I ended up catching a cold about a week after we got back, which didn't do anything to speed my transition back to the road bike. I'm just now starting to feel better and stronger. Mike had his first 'good' ride (where he felt really strong and fit) 10 days after we got back - and after about 7 rides on his road bike. Even today, though, he doesn't feel he has the high-intensity power he had when we left - though he *does* feel that he has a better low-intensity base built up - which should serve him well in the coming race seasion. As for the touring aspect of the trip, while he enjoyed it, I think Mike might have been just as happy either riding a motorcycle or driving an RV, and stopping every day for a bike ride somewhere. He liked the travel alot, and really loved NZ, but it was a stretch for him to ride 3-5 hours a day, every day. He's alot more accustomed to shorter rides of higher intensity and it's hard to just switch back and forth between the two. I think maybe the 'daily grind' of it wore at him just a bit. Personally, I can't wait to go again. In fact one of the best (and longest-lasting) byproducts of a trip like this is that it makes me think about big-picture issues like 'what's most important in life' and 'what will I remember from this year' and 'what accomplishments am I most proud of' and 'what am I doing to ensure that I can afford the time/money/energy/freedom to make my dreams happen?' Because I think the worst waste in the world is a life wasted on unimportant details. And I really believe that if I don't commit to the dream, (and the first baby step is figuring out what the dream is) it will never, ever, ever have a chance of happening! But when I do, watch out!
I love reading this site and that is part of the reason I am putting my own journals on this website.  I want you all to share in my adventures. I do however have another website with even MORE great stuff on it such as: - main journal entries - Pj's journal entries - more pictures - more trip facts/figures/dates - a guestbook with TONS of signatures - contact information for both Pj and I - route maps The website is here" www.meisus.com We are doing this ride mainly to seek out the awesome adventures of a bike trip.  Neither myself (Ian) or my biking partner (Pj) have ridden bikes prior to this trip.  So if you think we are doing baby distances, that's why. Second to the adventures we are seeking, we are also trying to raise money for Cancer research.  Both Pj and I have a long history of Cancer in our families. So please donate what you can to help us out. I hope you enjoy this or our other website. Ian Herculson Paul Jay

Average Speed: 14.2 Km/h Days Distance: 40 Km Holy shit!  What a day.  I am now smuggled up inside my tent after finally getting the dam stove lit and eating a much needed supper.  We didn't leave on time...only a few hours late.  I got lost in Edmonton and ended up cycling an extra few Km's just to find PJ, Clay and my dear Sandra.  Thanks Alice, Darcy and Shelby for following me through all my lostness.  I love you guys. I was tired right away and I don't even want to mention the thoughts that entered my mind as I struggled to even bike out of Edmonton.  I don't know if it was the anxiety or the stupid amounts of water that I was drinking but I vomited after catching up with PJ and the crew.  But as things progressed the biking got easier.  We past Leduc and the airport in our 40 km ride.  That is not bad considering the head wind we had the whole time.  PJ is much faster than I am right now but I hope to break in soon. We finally pulled over at our chosen rest stop and the cows stood about 10 feet away to watch us set up camp.  I guess we are exciting to them.  I am sore and tired.  I miss Sandra already but we will push on tomorrow. 
Average Speed: 19.2 Km/h Days Distance: 35 Km A whole new day with a whole new outlook on this bike trip.  I awoke to Sandra crawling into my tent (a wonderful surprise) and unbelievable pain in my legs.  It was freezing cold as well during the night so I must wear some more clothing to bed. Sandra brought us some food, sugar, hot chocolate and some love and inspiration for me to continue.  Thanks babe.  After eating a breakfast of oatmeal, bananna's and a bagel, and packing up camp I was off again.  I was totall surprised by the increase in speed that I could maintain.  I was averaging close to 20km/h the whole way. However, today we had to stop early because PJ's tendons in his knees were to inflamed.  No probs tho...  Spent a full day relaxin and my mom even came out to visit us with more food and more love.  Tomorrow we will be off again for the 80km ride into Red Deer.  Hope mine and PJ's legs hold out.  We start with a MONSTER climb...for us anyways. 
Average Speed: 18 Km/h Days Distance: 75 Km More than anything, I am extatic that we made it into Red Deer.  We both had to overcome headwinds, knee pain, and the worst hills to date.  That monster hill I talked about turned out to be child's play compared to some of the others. It is the most amazing feeling to set a goal that you are unsure if you can really accomplish, and then beat it against all odds.  Even tho my knee was screaming in pain for the last 20 km's I pushed on hard.  It was so important to me to make it into Red Deer.  It gives me hope and encouragement for the rest of the trip.  I am excited that we set a desired pace of 75km's per day and did it by the third day.  It's awesome. When we arrived in Red Deer we couldn't find a hostel so we decided to spend 2 nights at the local Travel Lodge Hotel.  Ahh....good times.  Soft beds, warm nights, showers, and once again Sandra came out to see me.  Thanks so much Sandra. Spent today, Sept 10th, just doing some more shopping and resting.  We also got to do some much needed laundry.  Our clothes STANK!  Thanks Jackie from Red Deer.  Tonight we will have some beers and relax.  Hope to be in Calgary in two more days. 
Average Speed: 19.2Km/h Days Distance: 47 Km After being so excited about doing a full day of biking on Monday, today was depending on ohow you look at it, a big let down.  We left Red Deer at about 11:30AM and my knee was still hurting.  We stopped for our first break after one hour of biking and the pace was great.  Pver 20km's/h.  But my knee hurt so I had to exchange my not so good tenser for PJ's good one.  We did another 20 Km's and I had to stop again due to knee pain.  We stopped for lunch right outside Bowden Penitentiary....jail. The last 7km's were awful.  I have never pushed myself to tears before but there is a first time for everything.  Finally I gave in and told PJ that I had to quit for the day and rest my sore knee.  I guess the real dissapointment comes from setting a gold of Calgary in 2 days and knowing I will not make it unless I have a KICK-ASS day tomorrow which probably won't happen with the pain I am in. I guess I could look at it like "I biked 47 km's with knee pain" and that should suffice.  How many others can even do that?  But it is hard when you are on a bike and want to go so far everyday.   Well that's part of the trip tho.  Some failures and some success...just push on. A few more things to add.  Not all is bad on this bike trip.  So many things are so interesting and fun.  Eating for instance is always a great time.  More so than ever.  I have also never eaten so healthy.  Cars, trucks, motorbikes, and semis also honk at us.  Some want us out of the way but most are in support of what we are doing.  The night sky away from the city is truly an infinite wonder with the millions of stars, northern lights, and bright moons.  Also acheiving speeds of over 50 Km/h on bikes is an absolute thrill and rush.  It's even kind of nice to crawl into my tent as it is starting to feel more cozy all the time even tho it is still pretty cold at nights. After hours of biking, setting up camping, cooking, eating, cleaning, and putting everything away, PJ and I entertain ourselves with verbal banter, crib, throwing around the football or just chatting. Trent was right, "not all of travel is glitz and glamour, but the rewards are immense." 
Average Speed: 18 Km/h Days Distance: 52 Km Surprise, surprise!  We didn't make it into Calgary.  Have about 48 - 50 km's left to go.  Today started out with very little pain and a great pace.  In the first hour we covered 23 km's.  It was relatively flat tho.  Then we breaked for a bite and all of a sudden out of no where there are monster hills all over the place along with a strong head wind which frustrated me to the point of screaming out profanities to the hills and winds.  My tantrum didn't work. But still I pushed on with now incredible knee pain again.  It's cool to think that I am doing all of these Km's in pain and with one leg taking most of the work of peddling. We were running low on water so I stubled across the highway to a farm to ask for some water.  We met a nice old man named Bill who kindly allowed us to fill our water bottles and gave us each a cold coke. That hit the spot!  Thanks Bill! Tomorrow we will be in Calgary no matter what.  If I can't make it on the bike than Jeanette will come and get us.  I have decided to rest my knee for 2 days to try and get better.  I really hope that is enough time to heal my pain. I also wanted to add that today was so tough that I had to swallow some pride and walk my bike up two big hills.  The pain was unbearable.  I am also growing to love the semi's that pass us by so close.  At first they were a bit nerving, but now I love them for they create such a wind that it pulls me forward for a brief second and gives me a chance to rest and to gear up a bit to improve my pace.  They are also strong enough to stop the constant headwinds for about 5 seconds.  Not much but a break is a break!
Average Speed: 27 Km/h Days Distance: 50 Km Today I got the breaks I needed so badly.  My knees are both now hurting as the right knee has been over compensating for the failure of the left one.  I almost didn't even try to cycle to Calgary as I was in that much pain.  But I decided that not trying was the worst idea.  This morning was very cold and the winds were strong but this time at our backs.  That is the main reason I decided to try.  I flew. We travelled at speeds of up to 40km/h and averaged 30km/h most of the time.  I stopped only once to take a picture of the Welcome To Calgary sign.  Other than that the 3 Advils I took this morning worked out very well.  In less than 2 hours we arrived at Jeanettes house. The ride through Calgary's streets, especially the Deerfoot Trail, was scary.  4 lanes of traffic being merged into 6 and sometimes I found myself in the middle of the road surrounded by crazy Calgary traffic and waiting for the perfect moment to get over two lanes to the safer shoulder.  A few really tense moments for sure. But everything worked out and we were greeted by Carole, Jeanettes mother.  We had our showers and naps before actually seeing Jeanette.  We met Rick, Jeanettes father, Igor the guy who drew the Lord Of The Rings covers, his girlfriend and some other family friends.  We all stayed for a wonderful supper with some great pictures of the whole show. After dinner PJ and I entertained the crew with a few songs on the guitar and then headed out to the pub for a great time.  A full day for sure.  Now it is relaxin time.  Let the knees heal up a little before we head south to Lethbridge. Ciao 
Average Speed: 21.2 Km/h Days Distance: 82 Km HAPPY 25th B Day Ian! We didn't really get the chance to leave Calgary as early as we wanted to.  We left around 2:00PM.  Had loads of fun in this wonderful city and I even found it a bit hard to leave.  A feeling I am sure weill come again as there will be many magical places on our tours.  Got a bit lost going out of Calgary cause the bike paths are not well labelled, but they run along the Bow River which is beautiful.  But once again we decided to ride the Deerfoot Trail. This was my time for giving out fingers as I was more comfortable and gave hand signals that the drivers completely ignored.  Took lunch after a strong 25 km's at the place where we were to meet Trent but the time lost on the bike trails probably was enough to Trent to give up on us.  Sorry Trent...we tried! Had some tough climbs in thelast few km's out of Calgary with strong headwinds.  I took the opportunity to look at the Calgary city centre from afar on a bridge to say goodbye in my own way as I knew everything from now on would be new to me. I could tell that my knees have started the healing process as we climbed and climbed the foothills of the Rocky Mountains and I dazed off into their enormity thinking about all the adventures that route may have.  But that is for another time.  We cycled on to 82 km's and a Super 8 Motel where we will stay 2 nights to rest knees again and celebrate both my B-day and an excellent day of biking.  I feel sore but strong and very excited as I know that the US border is fast approaching and will contain more adventure and stories. Take care from High River! 
Average Speed: 21.8 Km/h Days Distance: 87.27 Km After spending a great day in High River in the swimming pool, hot tub and nice room of the Super 8, we were off again with high hopes of making the 150 km ride to Lethbridge in only 2 days.  A feat we could not accomplish on the Edmonton->Red Deer or Red Deer->Calgary rides.  But as the knees grow stronger so does our pace.  Todays ride was quite scenic with the mountains off in the distance to one side of me and the prairie flat lands to the other side.  Quite beautiful at times. I got a little scare today as my shots of knee pain started in at about 46 km's.  I was afraid of the repeat of the last 2 150km treks.  No more 3 days on those distances please.  But some advice my aunty Carla gave me worked out well.  Thanks Carla it worked beautifully.  We experienced STRONG side winds today which made the biking more difficult.  But we decided to head east down highway 519, 87 km's away from our starting point this day.  But even tho I felt strong enough to continue, we stopped for the night at a well placed campground.  A beautiful little spot with few people and much quieter than in the ditches of Highway 2. This place has nice lawns (even ground makes for a better nights sleep) and a nice little pond stocked with goldfish and trout which we watched jumping to eat flies for supper while we ate our own supper.  Back to pasta with stewed tomatoes, tomatoe paste and some spices.  YUM! My knees feel great and I am sure we can handle the 65 - 70 km ride into Lethbridge tomorrow where we will stay with Clay's mom and pick up some more MP3 player batteries.  We ordered them cause PJ lost his.  He also lost our really good multi-tool but PJ is a bit of a tool anyways.  No biggie PJ. Feeling great and excited for our stay in Lethbridge.  PEACE! 
Average Speed: 21 Km/h Days Distance: 70 Km Well we made it to Lethbridge but not at all without a fight.  The 31km stretch down 519 was quite easy as the winds were so strong.  I would honestly say about 50km/h non-stop.  The started up in the morning when we were packing up camp.  This was a bit frustrating as it was hard to fold up the tent with the winds blowing it all over the place.  I also had to get over losing my 1st item of the trip. My pack towel blew into the nice little pond as I was putting on my biking shoes.  I could have reached it in time if I would have just stepped one step into the pond but my shoes were laced on and too expensive to replace just to save a $20 towel.  So I watched as it soaked up 10 times it's weight in water and suck to the bottom. Anyhow, the ride down 519 happened in only 53 minutes time with speeds barely dropping below 40km/h.  The howl of the winds was definitely cool to hear.  Also the hum of my tires over the pavement.   Sounds that we could not hear over the roaring traffic of highway 2 traffic.  At the turn-off to highway 23 we realized that the wind was now kinda in our face at an angle.  Well I tried to ride in that and was tossed around like an idiot on a bike in a wind storm.  I was blown into the middle of the first lane on the highway.  That gave me a scare so I decided to walk my bike for a bit hoping the wind would let up.  NOPE! I must have looked stupid walking my bike down a hill.  But we stopped at a little river and watched as a sparrow played games in the strong winds.  He just would try to hover above the water, then he would be swept away by the winds and would come back for more. I asked PJ what he thought of hitchhiking into Lethbridge.  Sure he said.  I will meet you there when I finish biking in.  Him saying that made me think again about how I should at least try.  So I did. The first few km's were tough but soon enough we were sailing again as the highway turned so the wind was our ally.  We made it into Lethbridge in 2 days. This city is beautiful.  Seems to be cut right into the earth with lots of valleys.  I hit a new high speed on my bike.  72 km/h!  I simply coasted to that speed as the hill was that steep.  Got only a little lost in Lethbridge but made it to Wilma, George, Dalyce and Shadow the dog's house. Thank you all for the place to rest our tired bodies.  We will stay here a few days to get some chores done and take advantage of our last Canadian stop. US here we come. 
Average Speed: 29.1 Km/h Days Distance: 87.52 Km   What a wonderful stay in Lethbridge.  The family was great, wonder suppers and we even got to use George's van to get around town.  Thanks George!  We left Lethbridge hoping to make it to a small town called Milk River.  The wind was pretty cold but the direction was in our favor...at our backs. The ride was fairly easy as we completed the 87 km jaunt in under 3 hours and stopping only twice briefly due to cold winds.  My legs felt stronger than they have been even before this trip.  All hills on this ride were surmounted quite easily with my piston like quads...or so I was imagining anyways. Milk River is a small town with almost no one in it.  Kinda scary actually with how desolate it was when we arrived.  We decided to stay in a hotel again cause it is so cold outside.  Tomorrow we will cross the border and should be there for a bit while they search through our bags.  Actuall I can't wait.  I thought about this the whole way down from Lethbridge.  I can't wait to drive by that singe mountain that I have been staring at for the last 40 km's.  It's weird.  Just a huge mountain where there should be no mountain.  All else is flat except for that.  Quite interesting to look at actually. I am extremely pumped for tomorrow. 
Average Speed: 17.8 Km/h Days Distance: 79.59 Km  Today was by far the hardest ride we have had.  The highways were full of large and long hills and the first 40km's were accompanied by 30km/h headwinds.  Tough!  I honeestly didn't think I'd make 80km's today but I did.  Maybe it was the extreme excitement of finally being over the border.  Pretty exciting stuff has happened here so far. Crossing the border was simple enough surprisingly.  We were asked only a few questions by Mac McGlaughlin, had to fill out one form and were sent on our ways with best wishes and some travel advisories for Central America.   We finally past that mountain that just sort of sticks up out of nowhere.  It was quite a site. I stopped on the side of the highway at about 60 km's to stretch my legs out and a nice guy stopped to ask if I was ok.  Also our first highway patrol officer run in was today.  He pulled up beside me and said, "Meow, you know how far it is to town don't you?" He was just making sure I was ok I guess.  Just funny to see Farva* on the first day in the US.   *See the movie Super Troopers.  Very funny. We are now in another hotel in Shelby, Montana.  We have decided to stay in rooms on Mondays and Thursdays so we can catch some wrestling.  And today is Monday so.... 
Average Speed: 18.1 Km/h Days Distance: 137 Km I am almost to tired to even make this journal entry.  We stayed in Shelby an extra day cause of rain and cold.  We were both upset with ourselves about taking off another day so we decided to do 2 days of biking in one day.  Yes, 137 km's in one day.  And if that is not tough enough, we were mostly climbing and had a constant headwind of 10-15 km/h the whole way.  I still can't believe we made it that far.  I surprise myself.   Saw some amazing scenery today in the valleys we dipped into.  One was called Marias Valley and was a great ride down into.    A beautiful river and trees spread all over the place cut right into the middle of the huge valley.  Wonderful to get into, but hell to get out of.  What a hill.  My legs must be at least 2 inches bigger from todays ride, or maybe it's just the stupid amounts of Ben Gay I put on them.  That tingly feeling just puts me back into a happy place. Great Falls is not at all what I expected.  It's about the size of Red Deer, AB only it's kinda old.  I mean the buildings are all really old styled.  Thin, red brick and tall with steel stairways for fire escapes and a lot of dirt all around. Not all of the town looks like this...just where we are staying.  Some of Great Falls is very nice with grassy knolls and winding rivers all over the place.  However, we must move on... 
We are still in Great Falls, but that's ok.  We met a pretty cool guy named Paul who tokk us out for drinks last night.  Me and PJ were at Appleby's having some drinks and he was the bartender on duty.  We got to talking and the next thing we knew we were at a pub called the Sip N Dip and absolutley wrecked.  The SipNDip has a pool behind the bar that is acutually viewable from the side because of a thick plexi glass wall.  They actually pay girls to swim in mermaid outfits in the pool during busy hours.  We met Vern, the bartender who bought us a few rounds.  Thanks Vern. We may go back there tonight with Paul but will take it easier.  We took a cab to Appleby's today for lunch.  Met quite an interesting cab driver with lots of red-neck in him.  He drove up in a blue Pontiac with no taxi meters or signs anywhere on the car.  It was just a normal car.  How are we going to get charged?   The guy was nice, polite and very talkative.  Told us all about how we was going to EXPLODE the cab scene into Great Falls with his new taxi company.  "As soon as the bank approves my loan, I am gonna buy me 10 Caddillacs and hire only nice drivers who are good lookin."  And he plans to do it all by word of mouth.  Good luck man! So he decided $6 was the fare for the 16 block cab ride.  Seemed like he just picked the number at random.  Why is it that everytime we take a cab, I sit in the front and just invite in the conversation from these type of people?  In Red Deer, I almost forgot to write about this, but PJ reminded me, our cab driver was insane.  He kept telling us about how many retards lived in Red Deer.  He'd kinda get angry as he would blurt out, You know your in the fucking retard capital of Alberta?"  Ya...ok bud, we'll get out here! Anyhow, should be interesting tonight.  Will let you know! 
Average Speed: 22.9 Km/h Days Distance: 96.72 Km Total Distance: 940.87 Km Well well well....the people of Great Falls had a hard time letting us go.  Our friend Paul wanted us to stay the week and party.  I am sure all the others we met probably would have enjoyed that as well.  I know I said I was going to take it easy and I did kinda...this is what happened on our last night out in Great Falls. For a while I was relaxin and sipping some cocktails and next thing a lawyer in a suede cowboy hat is buyin us shots of Crown Royal.  Then Vern brought over some more, than a new friend Katie....YEEEEEHAW! An announcement is made that the local entertainer, a piano playin lady, is celebrating a nilestone.  She has been playing piano at the Sip N Dip for 40 years.   Ya...she was about 75 years old.  Not my idea of good entertainment but definitley interesting.  Nonetheless we partied hard and had a great time. After the SipNDip we tried the Cigar Club but it was being closed early due to a fight that had broken out before we got there.  So we headed over to Pauls house to close out the night.  This place reminded me of my old pad in Thunder Bay, Ontario.  Black lights, stobe lights and a party goin on.  There were definitely some characters at this place and they liked the new boys almost as much as the married 35 year old cougar who tried to get me to go home with her.  What an experience we left behind there... Todays ride was simply amazing.  We rode our bikes through the first mountain range, High Forest Mountains.  We rode the first 35km's heading straight for the mountains and I was windering what our preplanned but remaining 70km's had in store.  We dipped into a huge valley and stayed there for about a 40 or 50 km ride through the most beautiful landscape so far.  I have heard of rolling hills before, but have never seen them like these ones.  They are 100's of feet tall and covered by grass and nice trees which was nice for a change.  There were also all kinds of little streams winding all over the fields.  Simply wonderful scenery. We came out of the mountains and finished off our ride at the 96 km mark, only 4 short of our goal.  But this hotel, the least expensive to date, is cozy and warmer than the night ar.  Too bad it wasn't just 4 more kilometers away.  I have been having a recurring dream lately as well. I awake each morning out of this dream and take a moment to look around.  That's when I wake up and I actually go through a physical moment of something.  I can't explain it really well but I just have a wave of peace, calm and realization roll over me at just the right pace. The dream always involves me sitting back amongst my friends and family.  Which means I am home from my bike trip with not really seeing anything.  I feel nothing but failure to acheive my goal.  But something is new.  For the first time I am feeling more upset at myself for failing than anyone else is.  I haven't let down my father, mother, siblings, or friends more than I have let down myself.  Failed at my own goal! But the good thing is that in my dream I am always trying to find a way to finish, and I am desperate to get back to the task at hand.  I awake at this moment of desperation and that's when the wave rolls in. Looking back even now, such a short time from departure, I feel and see memories of this trip as if they were years ago and not simply days.  It's an amazing feeling as I know there is much more left.  I love what I am doing and that grows each day. We are 60 km's away from 1000 Total Km's on this trip.  A big milestone for us.  We had originally set our pace at 2000 km's per month.  We will fall short of that in our first month as Day 30 approaches quickly.  We are going to do as many km's as we can in the last 7 days of this first month.  But the mountains are going to make it more difficuly for sure.  Good night! 
Average Speed: 26.6 Km/h Days Distance: 75.24 Km Total Distance: 1016.11 Km So if we do what distance we have done so far only 25 more times we will be in Argentina!  Our first 1000km's is now under our belts and I am pretty confident in saying that we know a lot more about cycling and touring in general.  Peddling strokes, dieting, mind conditioning and more.  I must say that it's a great feeling! Todays ride was actually very simple as the winds were at our backs at least 80% of the way.  We were supposed to go until 100km's but I desperately needed to do laundry and once again it was soooo cold. A quick note on the weather so far in Montana.  It seems as though all of the US has warm weather.  A bit stormy like in Florida with hurricanes Isidore and Lili going all crazy but at least it's warm.  It is unseasonabley cold where we are.  Some 22 degress farenhiet or 12 degress celcius colder than normal with no end to this cold snap in sight!  What kind of sick joke is this? Back to the ride.  We stopped in the town called Lewiston and this town really has something special to it.  It's old but clean and charming.  Lot's of nice touches like the centre town clock tower or old style street lamps.  The downtown is right out of a western style movie. We checked into the Yogo Inn and received an extremely warm welcome by the front desk man, Ronald.  He gave us a room discount and two free drinks at the bar just because we had to wait 30 minutes to get our room! So we went to the lounge for our free drinks and the waitress was equally as hospitable.  She told the hotel's PR manager our story and the PR lady came out right away to meet us.  She tried getting us a meeting with the local paper but no reporters were available.  She left us with some useful information oh how to easily get more media attention.  Let's just see how we do with it.  Tomorrow is supposed to snow and biking is going to be a challenge for sure.  We have to do about 130 km's just to get to the next town with a warm hotel to stay in.  Never a worthwhile reward without a scrumptrelescent challenge leading the way. But although it is cold, and even though it's far, I want to bike tomorrow.  I find myself welcoming the challenge this time rather than finding a way to dodge it or make it easier.  Maybe now I am just more interested in "just seeing" what happens if I just try. 
Average Speed: 19.9 Km/h Days Distance: 123.11 Km Total Distance: 1139.22 Km If riding through Southern Montana does nothing more for me, it will have at least added 1 solid inch of muscle onto my legs.  We did make it into the small town of Round Up.  A 123 km ride taking just over 6 hours.  In elevation, we actually rode down 800 feet, but with the amount of long and steep uphill climbs today, it just didn't feel like it. The vegetation and landscape have changed dramatically over the last few days.  The rolling hills have turned into rolling mountains, and the wheat fields are now filled with Alfalfa.  And jesus we saw so much wildlife on todays ride, I thought we were in some sort of zoo. I'm crusin down a hill at about 50 km/h and deer comes bounding over the fence and right in front of my bike all within seconds as I yell out "holy shit, it's Bambi!" and slam on my brakes to avoid a messy situation.  That one was maybe the 2nd of about 20 deer we saw today. The hills are also absolutely littered with black cows.  So many in fact that from a distance the hills actually look like giant ant colonies teaming with activity and life.  These cows are a little more interested in us than the Alberta cows who just run away if we get to close.  As we ride by, whole herds of cows run along with us until they are blocked by their fences.  It's quite a site! Because we didn't leave Lewiston until about 1 PM, we had to go look for some warmer biking clothing, we had to ride the last 40 km's in complete darkness.  What an experience that was.  Quite scary, interesting, fun, repetitive and everything else I can think of.  We rode with our Caughlin's headlamps to light the way, about the same amount of light as your normal household flashlight, only you wear it on your head.  Both our batteries ran out. PJ's first, we changed his batteries, and mine second with no spare batteries left.  So I had to ride close behind PJ with his headlamp being our only source of light. 40 km's in the dark seems like 80 km's in the daylight.  You can only tell uphills from downhills by how easy peddling is, you can't see corners or what that was jumping out of the bushes right beside you and scaring the living hell out of you.  You can't see anything more than 15 feet ahead of you except when a car drives by and lights the way giving us a peek as to what's coming.  We just rode one meter at a time staring only and sticking faithfully to that painted white line that led us the right way, for 40 km's.  A long night for sure! We are tired and grunting whenever we move our bodies too much.  So the beds are highly welcomed.  Only an 80 km ride into Billings tomorrow.  Childs play! 
Average Speed: 16.5 Km/h Days Distance: 82.51 Km Total Distance: 1221.73 Km Leaving Round Up, YEEEEEHAW!, I was pretty excited and anxious to get into Billings as my legs were pretty sore from the 123 km ride yesterday.  I knew we would be taking 2 days rest and that served as my main motivation to carry me the 82km's we had to ride today. Although today was no easy ride. On the first 20 km's  I couldn't get my bike going faster than 12 km/h and that was getting the best of me.  At the 20 km point, I angrily got off my bike and took a 5 min walk to get my thoughts together.  I was pretty frustrated.  At 25 km's, and not doing any better, I lost it. I wanted to pull over to "gather my thoughts" again and tried clicking out of my secure peddle clips to no avail. SNAP!!!  I got out of the clip, screaming and swearing at the top of my lungs and spitting like I was trying to put out a fire with spit.  I threw my bike down and ripped off my new sunglasses and smashed them into the ground.  I sat down and did not move for about 8 minutes.  PJ climbed the mountain behind me and made his hand shadow hit my head shawdow for laughs.  I still wasn't in the mood for laughs or smiles.  After about 15 mins of calming down and a Clif's Energy Shot, we rode again all the way through the Bull Mountain Range. The rest of the ride was faster but not much.  I averaged about 16.5 km/h.  A tough day but we are home free and in the hotel with some food in our bellies and big warm beds to fall into. Biking is 110% mental, and 100% physical! 
Ok I didn't really notice it last night.  Maybe it was that I was too tired or maybe because we only had to walk a half-block to find a great place to eat.  Jakes.  But today we find ourselves back in our hotel room after walking the perimeter of exactly one city block, looking for new directions to an internet cafe so we can satisfy your ferocious appetite for our journal entries.  I told you this trip would be exciting! What we thought would be an internet cafe, turned out to be a coffee house with 4 data ports.  That just means only four people, who happened to bring their laptops could access the internet.  Sadly enough for us, the guy who gave us directions and knew we were on bikes, didn't have it in him to realize that we more than likely are not carrying the beastly machines in our bike bags. They are filled with useless things such as food, clothing, and shelter.  Sorry for my cynisicm but I am a little impatient with the lack of insight! *Note: It seems as though I have raved once again, for nothing.  The guy I mentioned in the little story above did in fact give us good directions.  I just didn't see the only two computers in the coffee house.  It was too busy. My apologies to you kind sir for misconstruing your insight.  I am the idoit! 
A lot of people have been asking us how we manage to pay for our biking trip.  It's a fair question as anyone can easily see that this type of trip does require a significant budget.  There are very few people that I would like to thank for helping to make this trip a reality.   But of those people, who I do not wish to thank, my sister Margaret is not one of them. Margaret, thank you! Without you taking care of all my left over junk from before the trip; the phone calls to Telus for my cell phone and phone bills, the modem, the checks in my old mailbox, the tight-ass banks, and expecially running my business for me, this trip would not happen. I want you to realize that I picked you in the end to run my business for me, because I knew I could count on you no matter what happened.  I knew you would do as wonderful a job as you are and I couldn't be happier with the way things are going. I love you and can't thank you enough!  PJ is also pretty dam thankful! I also want to mention that my other sister, Alice, and her husband, Darcy, have just found out that they are pregnant!  I am going to be an uncle for the second time!   Way to go guys!  I am so excited for you and can't wait to meet my nephew, please when I get home! And just one more person, my mom!  Mom, I love you! Thank you for everything you are doing for us.  Even though my email inbox is always filled with blank emails from you, I don't care.  It doesn't bother me to see that you are finally learning how to use the computer!  I love getting your emails no matter what they contain! Thank you for all the help with contacting the media mom.  I really appreciate it! Also would like to add that yesterday, on a phone call with my sister Margaret, I realized that PJ has been publishing his "little" anecdotes about me on the website.  I am actually flattered that PJ even takes the time to write about me regardless of what he has to say, which is usually trying to degrade me in a way that is comical so that everyone laughs...ha ha ha!  Now I almost feel bad about not giving him many mentions in my publishings. It's not that I don't have any stories to tell about PJ's antics, there are a few, it's simply that I wanted to keep my journals interesting.  But now, from the comments that my sister has made I think it is time to share more about PJ's bike trip through the eyes of Ian.  I won't delve too much too soon into the stories of this highly odd individual, but will instead ease you into it.  It's probably better that way. I will start with the comicalness of PJ's, how shall I say, short short fuse.  PJ get's mad at everything and anything that does not comply with any one of the following;  his attempts to work with his 7 bungee cords and the many things they obvioulsy will hook on when being pulled on all at once, his heavy bicycle not rolling, steering or leaning the way he wants rather than what gravity dictates, or his constant attempts to dismount his bike gracefully, he has fallen at least 8 times on this trip to my one. I wish I had a picture everytime PJ has kicked, punched, yelled at, lost it on, slapped, jabbed, sucker punched, slapped, threw or tossed something because it didn't react the way he would have liked it to.  But I just can't take that many pictures.  I have neither the battery power nor the storage capacity to digitally record this amusing phenomenon.  But trust me, it's all the time. Ian 
Average Speed: 22.6 Km/h Days Distance: 115.92 Km Total Distance: 1337.65 Km It's back to campin!  Not that we couldn't find a hotel to stay in or anything crazy like that, it's just that we are tryin to save some money.  Too many hotels is hard on the budget. It's still frickin freezing at night but at least the tents provide us with shelter from the wind and the rain.  We rode through our first rainy day today.  It wasn't pouring but we did get pretty wet.  The rain suits are awesome but we with the amount that we sweat inside of them, they prevent our clothes from drying in the air.  We both got pretty soaked by the time we were done our 115 km's.  Now I sit in the tent trying to get used to the sounds that I am no longer familiar with. I am used to hearing the TV in the hotel room as PJ can't fall asleep without it on.  Weird!  But tonight, vehicles, trains, the winds and constant patter of small droplets of rain hitting my tent shell are what I am getting used to again.  It's completely black outside with no natural light.  The clouds are hanging low and covering any chance of night light that exist.  It's kinda scary again.  If you don't hold your thoughts together, you can almost scare yourself out of a good nights sleep! See ya tomorow! 
Average Speed: 14.6 Km/h Days Distance: 56.61 Km Total Distance: 1394.26Km So I bet you are asking yourself "how did they get from the southern part of Montana to the middle of Wyoming in only one day?" Right? Well today started off with a cold morning.  Awoken by the sounds of air horns from truckers who think they are funny, or should decide when it's time for us to wake up, I stumbled out of my tent to get the day started.  Boy were things going slow, and about to get worse. With the wind in our face, and the mountains getting bigger all the time, we rode into the Big Horn Mountains which are gorgeous but make for a dam hard ride.  The most beautiful and ever changing panoramic views continued to open up before our very eyes as we rode to the top of hills and peaks of mountains.  We broke for lunch after a really hard 50 km's.  This is when the story gets really interesting. I took off after lunch as usual, and headed down a huge hill.  I stopped at a pull over area with some garbage cans so I could get rid of my garbage I was carrying.  I looked behind me to see where PJ was, hmmm....no where in sight.  This was weird because it was downhill all the way from where we were, to where I was.  But no PJ in sight yet.  I took this opportunity to take some pictures of the beautiful mountains and noticed a small black blip coming slowly down the hill I had just rode down.  Oh boy, something was wrong!  PJ walked his bike the whole way down the hill as the tire that was slowly losing air during our ride, was now flat.  When PJ finally got to the bottom of the hill, where I was waiting for him, he told me that I should ride into the next town to get help or phone Vince, the guy who sold us the bikes in Edmonton, and ask about the funny valve stem on his bike tire.  We couldn't inflate the tire with our pump cause of this funny stem.  Anyhow, I started riding ahead not knowing what to think.  What if there were no taxi's to come back and pick up PJ?  What if the next town in far away?  What if, what if, what if... anyone who really knows me, knows I hate "what iffers".  Just do it. Luckily I met up with two truckers, right at the Wyoming border (we made it!!), who had pulled over on the highway whom I pulled up to and asked how far to the next town.  About 16 miles or 25 km's.  A 1 hour 40 minute ride the way things were going.  The truckers were inquisitive, having passed by us just moments ago and seeing me taking pictures and PJ walking his bike down the hill.  They asked why I was asking and I told them the situation. Mark, a great guy with a southern accent that you couldn't miss, offered help immediately and asked his other trucker bud, Russ from Seattle another simply amazing individual, if they could do anything to help us.  Russ said he could use his air compressor to fill PJ's tire.  Great!  We are saved!!! But when PJ arrived, and Russ tried to inflate his tire, the stem once again wouldn't have it.  So Russ and Mark told us to load up our gear, tie down our bikes, and they would give us a ride into the next town.  We told them we needed to go to the next big city that would likely have a bike shop so we could get this situation resolved.  That city just happened to be Casper, Wyoming which was about 150 miles or 240 km's away from where we were. So I hopped in with Russ, and PJ with Mark and we were off.  I have never been in a semi before, but have always wondered what it was like.  It's awesome!  They are super nice and the sleepers in these babies are unreal.  Carpet floors, padded walls and roofing, coolers, sattelite music, mini closets to hang clothing and more!  Simply awesome! We hauled ass in the semi's and I wathced the passing scenery trying hard as I could to take it all in as I knew I wouldn't be seeing it by bike.  Our Wyoming trail is breath taking.  Large mountians with valleys still covered with green grass and hardwood trees with their leaves turning yellow, red and gold as autum arrives in these parts. We arrived in Casper and took Mark out for some supper to say thanks.  Russ had to continue on to Denver, Colorado to meet a deadline.  Thanxs guys.  It was great ridin with you in your semis!   Russ and Mark are probably the nicest people that we have met in the US so far.  These two guys were more than willing to help us out when they saw us in need.  Thanks so much you guys.  I hope you get to read our stories sometime!  Mark, thanks for your genuine concern for our saftey on our bike ride.  You are a top notch individual brother, thank you! We gained 3 days back on our schedule and will be just a tad warmer now for our ride into Colorado...I hope anyways.  Quite an interesting day actually.  This trip will not cease to surprise us! 
 It seems that the internet hasn't made it's way to central Wyoming yet.  Or it's not very popular around theses parts.  Finding the connection here is tougher than a 13 km climb.  We did manage to get in one hour at the local library. We stopped at a cool pub, Sanfords, for some beers and a bite to eat.  One drink turned to a bunch and we ended up meeting two of the Sanfords waitresses.  Trisha and Keesa...hope I spelled those right girls.  They took us out tonight to watch Monday night football, the Packers won,  and show us the local scene.  Oh yeah, remember those tantrums I told you about earlier that PJ has.  Well on some light conversation about music, PJ decided he no longer liked what was being said, got up and walked home.  You rude bastard. Anyhow, thanx girls for showing us around and for a cool night in Cheyenne. PS.  PJ and I went back to Sanfords and he was going to apologize, but you weren't there...oh well! 
Average Speed: 22.6 Km/h Days Distance: 80.79 Km Total Distance: 1476.07.26Km We stayed an extra day in Casper to get in more internet time and do some groceries and shopping.  Not much to tell about yesterday.  But today was eventful from start to finish. Let's start at 9:00 AM.  I did my first ever media interview.  I did a live radio show interview with CBC news in Edmonton.  I think it went really well.  PJ was also supposed to be on the call but didn't get the chance cause of some phone tag mishaps. We then packed up and were about to leave when PJ noticed that now his front tire was flat.  So he had to unpack everything again, pull off the front tire and walk to the bike shop...again, to get the thing fixed up.  He came back witha new tube and a spare.  He didn't know it yet, but we would be needing that! Today was perfect riding conditions.  Finally warm and we had a 30km/h wind at our backs.  Awesome.  We did 40 km's no probs and stopped to have a bite just before a big downhill.  We took off, PJ first and then me which is unusual but I didn't think anything of it.  Expecting to have a big day, I was totally pumped and ready to go.  Three minutes into my downhill ride more problems arose.  BANG!!! I heard the pop of my back tire over the Alice n Chains tune playing on my Mp3 player.  The next thing I know I am sliding all over the highway and starting to panic.  I look at my speedometer to see how fast I am going, 55 km/h, and realize that I just may take a bad spill with no helmut on. I pound the brakes on my bike and unconsciously click out of my peddle clips with no problems and all without falling.  Phew!  Boy was that a good scare.  Now I have to deal with the fact that we have just taken off, Pj is ahead of me and moving fast with the wind at his back.  He probably won't look behind him for awhile to see if I am there. I ended up walking my bike 4 km's before PJ and I met up again.  Now the challenge was for us to learn how to change a bike tube.  It can't be that hard right?  HA!  It took awhile but we managed to figure it out.  The first tube we changed went flat after about 2 km's of biking.  Great!  We have to go through all that unpacking, taking apart the bike, changing the tube, and repacking....again.  We figured out that we had been "too rough" while pumping up the tube and the seal where the stem attaches to the tube had been ripped open.   We had already used up the extra tube that PJ bought, my extra tube, and the two others from PJ's two flat tires.  We had one last chance.  PJ tried his hand at patching up his original tube and we carefully pumped that up.  I crossed my fingers.  I was now going to ride with my safety at the hands of PJ's work on my tire.  Good god....why me? Normally I would trust a tire patch job as they are used all the time.  Where my main concern came from was watching PJ "learn" how to change a bike tube and patch a tire all the while acting like he knew exactly what he was doing.  PJ does this at times.  He often fools people when in conversation by pretending to know what he is saying but actually just needs friends to talk to.  He has perfected the art of bullshit. Needless to say, I had no choice but to give enough trust in my babbling companion to patch up my tire and realize if his work failed me, I would suffer.   But way to go PJ...the patch held out and we were able to make it to the next town of Douglas, Wyoming where I will fill up the tire to it's proper pressure.  But this is not even where todays events ended. When we got to the hotel we are staying at tonight, a great guy namde Mike was outside and he told us he had seen us riding outside of Casper.  The usual Q & A session happened but Mike showed much more of a genuine interest in us and decided to invite us for supper on him  WOW!  What a great treat!   We also met Scott who was travelling with Mike and the four of us dined at the restaurant and ate a great meal over some great conversation.  Mike is another one of those people you meet on a journey such as ours that makes it so much better.  Thanks Mike and Scott for a great night.  We hope to see you in Cheyenne! 
Average Speed: 18.6 Km/h Days Distance: 101.10 Km Total Distance: 1577.57 Km My body is hurting more today than it was even in my first week of biking.  God I am sore all over!  Todays ride was so hard on me and I can't really figure out why.  My front tire went flat today.  Ya 4 flats in 2 days.  But that was quickly patched up by PJ who now thinks he knows enough about fixing bikes to open up a bike repair shop.  He doesn't even know that a the thing that reads the tire pressure is called a pressure gage.  He calls it a tire reader or something like that.  But my tire pressure at about 48 PSI is not even close to the 80 PSI I like to ride on. We got the opportunity to see our new buddies Mike and Scott again.  They saw us changing my tube and pulled over to see if everything was ok.  We will see them tomorrow in Cheyenne as they will give us a lift into Denver tomorrow where we will break for 3 or 4 days depending on how much fun we have.  Back to the ride... The first 40 km's were done with relative ease and the wind diagonally at our backs.  The last 61 km's  was wind either in our face directly or diagonally.  That probably has something to do with the difficulty of the ride.   Once again we saw much beauty as we rode past 120 foot cliffs, the North Platte River, and many other interesting sights.  Many of the would-be creeks and rivers have completely dried up around here and leave only a dry bed of dirt and rock where the waters once ran.  It seems that there is a severe drought in Colorado that affects even southern Wyoming. I got quite a scare today as we rode our last 15 km's.  I was riding along watching the sun set into the mountains that loom over us from a close distance and I am taken by complete surprise as I hear two gunshots bang off from a very near distance.  As thoughts of the Maryland Sniper, who has now killed 8 people to date, run through my mind, I scramble to make sure everything is ok.  No bullet holes in myself or my panniers.  It turned out that a god dammed redneck was shooting at ducks within town boundaries.  He scared the hell outta me. Anyway, we ride about 120 km's tomorrow into Cheyenne.  I am going to get an early start, around 7:00 AM, just to make sure we make it by 7:30 PM.  We get our ride from Mike and Scott into Denver (160km's) tomorrow if we make it on time. I know some of you, especially my family, are thinking; hey you are supposed to be biking the whole way.  But I think we deserve the ride!  We have rode our bikes further than many of you thought we could, and now with my body already aching, we have to do another 120km's through the friggin Rocky Mountain Foothills to earn this reward. I am reading the book The Alchemist, that Jeanette gave me way back in Calgary, for the second time.  I really enjoyed it and find it's lessons to be quite intriguing and highly related to what we are doing. This bike trip is certainly offering PJ and I some really great rewards, but none of them have come easily.  For instance this ride into Denver mysteriously offered itself to us but to reap the benefits of this prize, we had to do some pretty tough biking through some pretty tough terrain.  Since we have started our new challenge, I have had 4 flat tire tubes to test our patience, strong headwinds to test our resiliance, and long distances with all the aforementioned obstacles to test our wills to succeed. The Alchemist relates the words luck and co-incidence to the universal language of life.  A language that is spoken between your soul and that of the world around you.  Not everyone understands this language, or even believes in it, but it is there.  I may be digging to deep but I do find that luck and co-incidence do happen to PJ and I.  But we always must first be aware of the opportunities that appear, and second work hard to get them.  Strange huh? Thanks again Jeanette for this book.  I love it. 
Average Speed: 14.6 Km/h Days Distance: 68.03 Km Total Distance: 1645.60 Km "To realize one's Personal Legend is a persons only real obligation...And when you want something, all the universe conspires in helping you to acheive it." Melchezedik, King of Salem The Alchemist Yesterday after my bike ride, I literally fell on the floor in complete exhaustion.  Today we were to ride an extra 20 km's  over yesterdays distance to reach Cheyenne and get our ride.  I awoke much earlier than I am used to in order to ensure that we'd have the time we'd need, plus extra, to complete the 120 km trek before 7:30 PM.  The first 25 km's were not all that hard.  I felt great and expected if things remained the same that we would complete our ride by 4:00 PM.  Lots of extra time.  But then the challenges of the day crept up upon us.  Actually only one challenge.  The wind. The winds has been in our face the first leg of our ride but they were so calm it didn't really affect the ride.  But just as I started riding again after our first break, the wind started to howl.  It did not just slowly gain strength either, it was out of no where and strong.  The situation was comparable to that of the day we rode into Lethbridge.  A side wind so strong it was pushing my bike onto the highway if I didn't excercise complete control of my bike and steering.  More trouble arose as the highway started turning into the head on wind.   The highway curved around some spectaculor mountain rocks that looked like castles the way they were cut by the course of nature.  They jutted out of the ground and towered above all else nearby.  The faces of the rocks were shear cliffs with jagged edges that added to the look.  Awesome! But they did nothing to stop the winds from coming on strong.  I really struggled with the uphill climb against the winds.  I am sure PJ had a harder time than what he is used to as well, but he dissapeared ahead of me.  I battled on and finally reached PJ who was already taking a rest.  We carried on and the wind did not let up. I lost my temper a few times out of frustration at the winds but I continued on, I had to.  I also now was starting to realize that if I couldn't pick up my slowing pace, we would not make it to Cheyenne in time.  The winds were turning colder as well be we received a bit of a break as the highway curved in a way that allowed for more speed but still poor stability.  Making it in time would mean maintaining this pace which could easily be slowed again by a simple turn in the road, inevitable! Right now we are sitting in the lounge at the chosen meeting place between us and our ride with Mike and Scott.  We arrived here at about 5:00 PM.  Did our pace increase?  Did the wind let up?  Nope.   At the 60 km mark, the world conspired in helping us to achieve our goal.  A couple who were driving an RV from Seattle to Houston pulled over to offer us a ride.  They felt that we may need one as the wind was blowing even their massive RV all over.  I gladly accepted thier kind offer. Joel and Leona Bachman, thank you so much for thinking to offer us a ride.  We certainly appreciated it! To give you an idea of what we dealt with, here is my biking times.  The first 25 km's took me 1 hour and 21 mins.  The next 35 km's took 3 hours and 10 mins. Well we will be in Denver, Colorado tonight and we will break for 4 days.  Then it's out of the mountains with winds mainly at our backs (hopefully) as we head easy towards Kansas.  Our southward bound leg is over.  We are also over the 1000 mile mark (1609 km's).  I can't wait to party in Denver. Thanks again to all those who helped us along the road to Denver. The Davinsons from Calgary:  Jeanette, Rick and Carole. Our buddy Clay's family in Lethbridge:  Dalyce, George and Wilma. The truckers in Norhtern Wyoming: Russ and Mark. Our ride to Denver: Mike and Scott (see you in Tampa Mike!) Our saviours on the windy day into Cheyenne: Joel and Leona Bachman. Without all of your help, this trip would have been much less enjoyable and much more difficult.  Thank you all!!! 
 The last few days have been awesome! Mike has been overly generous and treated us to two nights on the top floor of the Holiday Inn, and more excellent suppers with nice wines, and beers in the afternoons.  Mike, stop it, I could really get used to this.  But thank you.  It was great! We spent most of today packing and unpacking again as we checked out of the Holiday Inn and into our first Youth Hostel of the trip.  Not really what I had expected.  It's an old apartment complex with small rooms and shared bathrooms and kitchens.  Our room is about the same size as most college dorm rooms and there are two beds, actually one bunk bed in which PJ sleeps on the top level, 2 chairs and a TV.  That's it.  Pretty old and run down.  We haven't really met anyone here either which was the whole reason for wanting to be here.  Oh well, maybe later tonight or tomorrow. So we spent the afternoon in the local gothic pub.  A little crazy at first with all the face piercings but everyone just minded their own business and were actually quite friendly.  This place was only 8 blocks from our hostel and was supposed to have internet access but it was down.  Our luck sucks when it comes to the net.  We paid $12/hour at Kinkos the other night and ended up totaling a $72 bill...OUCH!  But this pub should have the internet by tomorrow. So instead of playin on the net, we got the opportunity to play some chess.  I finally beat PJ and ended his 5 game win streak while drinking some Heinekens.  We even partook  in a few Burnsteins, a B-52 with a shot of espresso served hot.  A little taste of back home for Pj and I. Then our evening started gettin really cool.  We went out and partied with Steve Reinprecht from the Colorado Avalanche.  PJ wasn't lying about being this guys old teammate.  I thought he was just desperatley trying to impress me by name dropping.  But whaddyaknow!  Had a great supper with a couple bottles of wine, a drink I am beginning to love, and went back to Steve's to play some foozeball.  What a cool guy.  He's got a real nice house which comes as no surprise as he has millions waiting for him in the NHL.  Way to go Steve, good work and thanks for a real cool night. I guess he got PJ and I some tics to the Av's game.  Denver so far has treated us really well.  What a great time! 
 Well, the Av's game was awesome!  Too bad Colorado lost 2 - 1 with the last goal being scored by Boston Bruins with 0.05 seconds left to play.  But the game was great and it was fun to be there. I am typing this journal update on the new laptop computer I bought.  After that internet cafe not having access and all the while saying "we'll get it tomorrow", and also having horrible internet access at the local Denver library, I was fed up.  I walked by an Office Depot and noticed that they were getting rid of all their old computers for like 20% off.  So I got a great deal on a super nice laptop.  Hopefully we will be able to update more easily now and also get all the pics we have been taking on the website.  There are some real cool ones.  We also bought a cell phone to talk with media.  But tell you what, since you are a loyal reader and have read this deeply into our journals, I will give you our phone number so you can call us some time.  You deserve it for reading so much about us.  1 303 249 8014. After playing with the computer for a little while, Steve called us to go out again.  We went out for a great supper again and more wine.  Then we headed over to another Avalance players house.  Scott Parker.  Another really great guy....what a monster too.  This guy shrimps me and I stand over 6 feet tall.  Anyhow, we partied there for a bit but then had to go as I bought PJ and I tickets for a Better Than Ezra concert that just happened to be playing one block from where we were staying.  So we said our good byes to Steve and headed to the concert feeling pretty dam good. The concert hall, called Ogden Theatre, was the oldest theatre I have ever been in.  It was a huge theatre but the roof was more rounded at the corners, with an older victorian style decor.  Just by being in the building I felt as if I were in a 60's theatre.  Really cool.   The opening band was a band called Cowboy Mouth.  The drummer was also the lead singer, a set up you don't see often as it takes a lot of coordination just to play the drums, never mind singing too.  This guy was from Louisianna for sure.  You could just tell by the way he looked and talked.  But man, did he get the place rocking.  An amazing job and I am glad I got the chance to check em out.  You can check out their website by clicking here. Better Than Ezra was good to watch too, not quite the show that Cowboy Mouth was but I went there to see three songs; Good, King of New Orleans, and Desperately Wanting.  Three awesome songs.  And when they played those songs, it was awesome.  I also got the chance to meet the drummer from Cowboy Mouth at the end of the show and told him what we were doing.  He seemed interested and wrote down our website address.  I told him to sign the guest book so let's just see if he does or not. We leave tomorrow morning and are now heading east towards Kansas.  We have a new route in mind that includes a 4 or 5 day ferry or barge ride down the coolest river in the US.  The Mississippi River.  An adventure just like Huck Finn had...well maybe not as cool but hey, I still get to do it and I can't wait. 
Average Speed: 20.7 Km/h Days Distance: 128.24 Km Total Distance: 1774.43 Km Today started with a bang...literally.  We are about 1.5 blocks away from our Hostel and my front tire blows.  Not only did my tube pop, my actual tire was ripped along the seam which rendered it useless.  So I hopped in  a cab with my bike and went to The Bicycle Doctor.  2 new tubes and my replacement tire were added to my bike along with a new air pump.  The one we have sucks.  Off we go...   As we head east, away from the mountians, the landscape flattens and the highway does not turn.  It appears as though we are in for a pretty ugly part of the USA.  Prairies.  Not much to see other than my first snake sighting.  The dam thing was crossing the highway and I almost ran him over.  I stopped to take a picture from a distance of course.  I'm not sure waht kind of snake it was but at about 4 feet long I didn't care to get to close of a look. At 50 km's, bang!  Oh god, my new tube!  I got another flat.  Can you believe this?  Is someone trying to tell me something?  A thorn was to blame an d maybe a really worn out and thin tire as well. We stopped at 80km's to decide what to do as Last Chance, a small town on the map was still about 35 km's away.  Or we could just camp at the 90 km mark and save a bit of money.  I chose to ride into Last Chance in hopes of a really cheap motel.  Nope. And it wasn't 35 km's away, it was 45 km's away.  I know you may be saying "it's only 10 more km's" but this is after already doing 118 km's and 10 km's on a bike takes about half an hour at a decent pace. We did our second night ride tonight only to find that Last Chance boasted a fat chance of having a motel or anything for that matter.  So we set up camp in the dark and ate supper in the cold.  Dam it gets cold at night.  Down to about 0 degrees celcius. Oh yeah, one more thing, the night ride included nothing but friggin big hills to contend with.  But I am much better at hills as I have discovered a new pedal stroke which has added at least 5 km/h in speed to my climbs!!!  Awesome.  Goodnight. 
Average Speed: 22.2 Km/h Days Distance: 121.07 Km Total Distance: 1900.01 Km A really good sleep last night even though it's pretty cold at nights.  I still can't convince myself to sleep naked for more warmth.  I am pretty dam warm with two pairs of pants, two shirts, socks, and my touque. I awoke to the soundsof cows going mad.  It was actually kind of scary as I have never heard a cow scream before.  I thought they could just moo, but these ones were going friggin bezerk.  I don't konw if I am glad or upset that I didn't see what was going on. A fairly simple ride today as the roads are now flatter than ever but the scenery is gross, real gross.  At about 84 km's we stopped in a town called Joes to buy some groceries and see if there was maybe an Inn to stay at as our 2 day distance was alreay over 200 km's.  We also wanted to get a bite to eat at a local eatery called Lunas Family Restaurant.  We sat down to eat after meeting the owners and were about to order when we realized we had no money.  Well...no cash, but credit and debit cards of which neither was accepted. But being the wonderful people they were, Luna and Andres and another guy who was named Joe I think (I didn't catch his name), cooked us up a great chicken fajita meal for nothing.  From the blessing of god they said.  Thanks you guys.  Your meal powered me through 35 more kilometers when I thought I was already done. We rode into the town of Idalia because we knew it had an Inn and wanted to do some web updates.  But can you believe it, the one room they had left...thank god, has no phone it it.  So no web updates.  But that's cool as we are at 250 km's in two days and are now extending our three day destination by 80 km's so we don't do only a 40 km ride tomorrow. Todays last 35 km's were done in the night again.  The moon, which is only 3 days away from a full moon, lit the highway so brightly that we didn't even need our headlamps.  There was also not a cloud in the sky which made for a breathtaking ride.  The sky was full of bright stars which sparkled over the the enormous canvass of the sky.  An unreal sight. My calfs are huge. 
Average Speed: 22.8 Km/h Days Distance: 49.35 Km Total Distance: 1949.36 Km We made it to Kansas! We did a short ride today rather than the long long one I wrote about yesterday.  The reason being that I started having small amounts of pain in my right knee and was not sure if I could do another 70 km's into the next town.  So I am resting my knee for the rest of the day, and and will do the short 70 km ride tomorrow into the town. St. Francis is a town that doesn't really have much in it.  Not a big surprise to us as we are expecting things to be this way all the way through Kansas.  I took a walk tonight around the downtown center.  I walked by the town hall, which so far is very similar to all other town halls in the US so far. They are very big grey brick buildings with the name of the town carved into the brick above the large entrance way.  There are also cement stairs leading up to the entrance of the building which shows the pride and grandness of it all. I sat down at the town park to gather some thoughts.  Where I sat was actually an outdoor ampitheatre made of cement with stadium-like seating surrounding the stage in a large semi-circle.  It was very nice. As I sat there, I noticed the same 6 or 7 cars driving by every once in a while with one car doing what seemed to be laps.  This driver passed by me at least 16 times before I left and I am sure he is still out there doing more.  I realized that these people, from small towns with little to do, are bored out of their minds without even knowing it.  Kind of how I used to be back in high school.  My life was simply school followed by the pursuit of fun.  In my high school years I, as these people were doing, was always looking for something which then I thought was fun to do.  But now I think that I was simply looking for better life choices.  Other options or ways to live my life in a more exciting way.  "There must be something more" I would often think to myself. I guess my sitting there by myself for so long had stirred up some curiosity in some of the people in the vehicles as a few of them honked or waived at me.  And later on my walk home a guy asked me if I was the dude sitting in the park cause some girls were trying to figure out who I was. Just someone out of the ordinary who added a little more interest to a rather routine Saturday night of driving up and down the town strip.  Good luck people.  I hope you find what you are looking for. My quads are dense as the base of an ancient oak tree. 
Average Speed: 22.8 Km/h Days Distance: 69.12 Km Total Distance: 2018.48 Km Over 2000 km's under our belts now. A quick ride today. 70 km's in under 3 hours with not much to see except two more snakes both dead on the highway and one pretty cool valley.  Other than that the day was pretty much standard with my flat tires dictating when we take our breaks. Ya, I got another flat today.  I don't even know how many I am at now.  I stopped counting when it got ridiculous.  So with nothing much to write about, I will talk about the wind. The wind is like adding 20 lbs to your bike on the up hills and flattening your tires on the downhills.  That is actually only when the wind is in our face.  But in our case that happens to be about 90% of the time so far.  It is quite a meterological audacity.  It is so ofthen that I, and if you know me you will be surprised at this, have just accepted it and learned to be patient with it rather than yelling or screaming at the wind. I can't wait until the wind eventually blows at our backs.  It should happen soon, I hope.  Anyhow, good night for now. My wild hair gives me rugged good looks. 
Average Speed: 16.8 Km/h Days Distance: 45.21 Km Total Distance: 2063.69 Km Nothing to write about.  We just bike. 
Average Speed: 15.5 Km/h Days Distance: 57.81 Km Total Distance: 2121.50 Km There are really only four variables that can make a bike ride tougher and less enjoyable. 1.) Head winds 2.) Low temperatures 3.) Precipitation 4.) Hilly The only other major thing I would add to this list is distance but I chose to leave it out as distance is a variable which is controlled by the biker.  The other 4 variables are uncontrollable.  In todays ride of slightly under 60 km's, all four variables were present. We awoke  to rain falling heavily but passing quickly so we decided to go.  We were expecting light rain.  It was cold but we do have the biking gear for this situation as we got our first chance to try it out.  Just as we hopped on our bikes, the rain started to pour.  Shortly after, the rain turned into hail which fell heavily in us and even stung at times on the point of impact. After what I thought was an hour of biking, thoughts of turning around were winning the war in my head.  But I looked at my odometer and we had already gone about 16 km.  I was really dissapointed but decided it best to carry on.  I don't particularly like Kansas and would like to be warm.  So we peddled on. It's a tough thing mentally to ride in these conditions.  I found that the only things that really helped were thinking of warm thoughts or singing songs out loud wht Pj that contained the word "rain" in them.  we thought of quite a few. We stopped at 28 km, halfway, so Pj could warm up his fingers which must have been so cold.  I have full fingered gloves and mine were numb.  Out feet were also very cold and wet as our shoes are not water proof or warm.  They are full of vents which are made to keep the sweat down.  But they let water in pretty easily. After going about 1 km out of the way to look for an advertised cafe, which turned out to be shut down, we carried on for the 2nd half of the battle.  By now my fingers and feet were so cold and numb that I couldn't feel them any longer. Lightning and thunder passed dangerously close to us as we rode, what seemed to be, right through the worst of a storm.  More hail, lots of rain, freezing cold and lots of white wash.  Do you konw what white wash is?  Let me explain. Have you ever had the urge, while driving your car and passing by a person who is walking past a big puddle in the street, to hit the puddle at full force soaking the unsuspecting victim from head to toe?  Well the water that hits that person would be called white wash. Well our white wash was not quite as easily taken.  Ours came from transports travelling at 110km/h in cooperation with the wind.  When we got sprayed the combination of wind and white wash from the trucks would a.) slow us down and b.) insure that if there were a dry spot anywhere on us or our equipment, that it be found and drenched. I swear some truckers were crossing over the center line to satisfy that urge I talked of earlier. "Hell they are wet anyways...why noy?" As we arrived closer to our destination, where the road signs were advertising the local town businesses and hotels and such, my swelling sense of pride through accomplishment took over my mood and I was happy again.  I did it! We rode into the skirts of town just as more hail started to fall.  With only 1 or 2 km's left to ride I screamed out "bring it on".  At that very momemt a truck passed by, going through a deep puddle, and you can imagine the rest.  Pj had a great laugh at that one as he witnessed the whole thing from less than 10 feet behind me.  How ironic. We pulled into the first hotel we saw and moved quickly into the warmth of the office.  The poor front desk lady, must have thought we were just out of the nut house as we shivered loudly and uncontrollably.  She watched in disbelief as we both struggled to pull our wet and cold gloves off our swollen hands. Once in our room, it took at least 30 mins to warm up enough to even look in our bike bags to see how water proof they really are.  Well here is the skinn on Arkel bike bags after 4 hours of complete soaking.  Nothing in our bags was completely soaked, but everything was a bit moist.  Not too bad Arkel.  Not to bad at all. So we won a big battle.  This ride, for me anyways, was now the biggest and hardest challenge I have faced.  It sucked and it was tough but I am more than glad I did it.  It will make all other seemingly "tough" rides easier to handle as when that ride becomes tough, I will think of this one. With that said, Pj; I would like to take this opportunity to thank you.  I didn't want to leave in the morning when I saw that down-pour.  But I wathced as you continued to get ready for biking in this shit so I did too.  Even though the rain didn't let up as you said it would, but rather rained harder and hailed even, I am glad, no more than glad, happasurflous, that you persuaded me into riding.  Thanx buddy.  This is the exact reason I brought you on this trip and you have shown now a number of times that I chose right. My abs are on their way to becoming a chiseled work of bodily art. 
Well we were suppsed to have one day of rest and then leave Norton again.  However, the stupid amounts of snow that has falled on our day off has stranded us and we cannot bike on the snow and ice on the ground.  Hell, I had a hard time even walking on it...it's dam slippery. So we are stuck here until hopefully only tomorrow.  I want on my bike again dammit. I bought a Titleist had and I look incredible in it. 
Average Speed: 25.4 Km/h Days Distance: 100.73 Km Total Distance: 2222.23 Km Once again and uneventful and unscenic ride.  The only thing to report today is that we did 100km's in under 4 hours today.  Quite good.  Also we will start heading south-east again tomorrow which makes me happy cause we can start campin once we hit warmth again. I'm not conceited, I'm convinced. 
Average Speed: 23.3 Km/h Days Distance: 90.91 Km Total Distance: 2313.14 Km The ride today was a little more scenic than the last few days.  There are a lot more trees.  God bless the farmer who decided not to cut them down.  The corn fields are all harvested and are now just large fields of red stalks.  It's pretty easy on the eyes with lots of color to look at.  We also passed t he first lake since we have left.  Nice to finally see some water. The ride was fairly easy so not much to tell about.  We finally also got a hotel with two seperate rooms.  Can you believe it...still the same price but twice the privacy and much quieter at night without the TV on.  This is a nice change. My emerald green eyescan penetrate your soul and make you feel pleasant unfamiliarities. 
Well we stayed an extra day here in Beloit for two reasons.  The weather being shitty and cold was my main reason.  I also really like having my own room.  But the other reason is really cool.  Dave Matthews Band tickets went on sale today for Dec. 11th in Atlanta, Georgia.  I know it's 6 weeks away....what's your point?  The concert probably sold out in just hours so really there was no time to get them other than today.  I consider it even lucky we got them as Pj only found out about the tickets going on sale yesterday.  So we are lucky to have had the laptop to buy em. The phone in ticket sales was ridiculously difficult and didn't allow for Canadian addresses for mailing the ticks.  So we ordered 2 tics, pretty good seats, and we are both excited now.  Although I am not excited to the point of dancing and singing like Pj, but I am excited. We also had a good talk to night about past events, things that bother us and things that we can change to make the trip better.  Overall, a good day off even tho we shoulda left.  Out biking days to rest days ratio is gross. So we are really going to do what we can to fix that.  I promised Pj tonight I will do my best and this promise I don't want to break.  You will find out how I do soon enough tho. I am becoming legendary at guitar and will soon play sweet sweet melodies to foreign ladies...look out! 
Average Speed: 21.0 Km/h Days Distance: 93.39 Km Total Distance: 2406.53 Km Ahhh....I am really starting to believe that this trip is only getting more scenic.  Trees, although mainly once taken for granted in thier simplistic beauty, are now more than welcome pleasantrees.  Get it?  Pleasant Trees....no?  Not funny hey?  Well they make the ride much more enjoyable and help me to ignore the bad things like the cold air that massages my feet to the point of numbness or the different numbness that starts in my ass and travels down my inner thighs as the circulation to my legs slows to about the same velocity as Pj's slapshot. The wind, even though most storm systems are moving west to east, blows into our face incessantly.  How the hell does that work anyways? I also saw some new types of land animals.  Donkeys and sheep.  I couldn't believe we saw such abnormal creatures so soon after having a conversation with my sister Margaret about the niceties of wildlife watching.  Actually I was on the side of thinking that particular activity would be quite boring but from the picture you see here, you can easily tell that I was wrong.  I am overtaken with surprise and joy as I move in for a closer look.  Note:  I also cycled past a pig farm but did not want to take a picture as the stench was overbearing. Only a 65 km ride tomorrow into Manhattan which now seems a relatively short ride.  I wish I felt this way at the beginning of the trip.  We will stay in Manhattan one day to do some bike repairs.  My gears are squeaking now.  The first sign of wear on the bike.  I have also started into the spanish lessons.  I think both Pj and I will learn faster if we try to speak to each other in Spanish. Tengo bella.  Buenos nuechos. 
Average Speed: 21.4 Km/h Days Distance: 65.41 Km Total Distance: 2471.94 Km Who knew Kansas had so many trees and hills?  It seems we are getting into a much more hilly area.  We have done some great downhill coasting on todays ride.  One of the best ones was coming right into the town of Leonardville.  A very picturesque town with large trees hanging over the highway making it look more like a small town street rather than an interstate highway.  The best downhill coast, however, was into Manhattan.  It was a long coast rounding a small mountain and opening up the view of large white letters "KS" embedded into the side of a big hill, and the town ceter appearing out of nowhere. We rode to the Super 8 near the town center and spent $130 of our last $300 on two nights accommodations.  The first thing I did was my laundry.  I have been wearing the same biking clothes since Denver without any laundry services in any of the hotels we have stayed at.  Each of the last few mornings I would try to hold off on puking whill getting dressed.  The smell is god awful.  Next I got on the net to do more worrying about our severe lack of funds.  $170 is not a lot of money to have available if you know what I mean.  Finally after enough worrying I decided to say screw it and go out for beers.  Maybe getting drunk would give me some ideas!  Pj wasn't around when I decided to drink away some worries and celebrate almost being out of Kansas. He had went to the mall to get back in touch with civilization.  I went to the mall to find him but did not.  We eventually met back at the hotel and it seems he had the same line of thinking going on as me.  But had been thinking of a creative way to present his idea to me, and also how to tell me he had bought new pants while I was fretting about money.  He even hid the pants in the hotel hallway as he offered me his song and dance about the good or the bad news.  I chose the bad news first as I would rather have the after taste of something good.  "I bought pants" he said.  He explained to me that they only cost $10 and they were so nice.  What he didn't know was that I was already passed the point of caring about money. He then told me the good news.  We had $40 in Chilli's gift certificates and Chilli's just happened to be across the street.  I told him "great, lets go drink it!"  All excited we left to go drown bad past experiences.  No mom, I am not a drunk.  Stop worrying. We quickly ran into another problem.  The gift certs were good at only Edmonton Chilli's.  Neither of us wanted to beg for their use at this restaurant even as poor as we were.  That's classless.  But we did discuss selling them at a good discount to people outside.  So with no money and no gift certificates, I was back to let's just drink.  I couldn't help but remember that a few days ago Pj said that I shouldn't worry anymore.  He reminded me of all the times in life that he and I have been broke and still were ok.  This was foretelling to say the least.  We easily justified spending the $30 Pj found in his pockets, and what turned out to be a lot more as we got more drunk, in place of the gift certificates. We did end up drinking ourselves back to the carefree individuals we should be.  I can almost write a thesis on the positve energy generated by genuinely happy people and how it works like a magnet to attract more good things.  At some moment I over heard some people asking about "that Canada jersey" I was wearing.  I turned around to talk with them.  Gary and Jean had a great conversation with us about what we are doing and why of course.  They were really great people and they promised they would sign our guestbook.  They did...twice. They were sitting with the manager of Chilli's, another cool guy we met named Mike. He told us he would take us out to see the night life of Manhattan which is supposedly great as Kansas State University is nearby and plays host to 25,000 partying animals.  Our type and age, finally! Well we went back to the hotel while Mike closed up shop and I had a power nap....I passed out really.  Mike showed up thinking that just cause we had been drinkin all afternoon that we weren't going to make it out.  Guess he doesn't know us that well....how could he?  He took us to Longhorns Bar and Grill on the strip werher all the bars are.  We had more beers and tequillas, served up by a sexy lady who posed for Playboys Top 12 Colleges in the October 2002 issue, before heading back to Mikes house to close out the night.  We got to the hotel at about 4 AM and passed out quickly but not beofre promising Mike that he could buy us dinner the next day at Chillis.  I think he wanted to get us drunk again as we had a super time together. Thanx Mike for a super cool time.  You'd better keep your promise you made to us...see you in Florida buddy! I should become the poster boy for either Cannondale biking shorts or Billabong beach wear! 
We spent our day off just doing some internet updates, and we took our bikes to the local bike shop, Pathfinders.  Dave the manager, and Jeff who talked to Pj first took excellent care of us and are currently doing some work on our bikes.  A couple minor repairs were needed to both our bikes.  I higly suggest that if any of you are reading this and will ever bike through Manhattan, take your bikes there and buy something even if you don't need it...these guys are great! We are now going to contemplate changing our route again.  We both want so badly to be warm that we may head south instead of continuing east to St Louis.  We'll let you know tho!  Look at the crap I have to stare at everyday.... 
Happy Halloween everyone.  Hope you remember us in your celebrations as we are thinking and talking to each other of all our friends back home! See ya in the November entries.
Average Speed: 26.6 Km/h Days Distance: 90.12 Km Total Distance: 2566.65 Km The two great things about today are this.   1.) We have one biking day left in Kansas State.  Nothing against anyone from Kansas but I hated this state.  It's flat on the west side and very unscenic until you get to about 200kms from the east border.   2.) The wind was finally at our back today.  Not fully but enough to get 90 kms done with an average speed of almost 27 km/h.  A solid ride. I am feeling much stronger as well.  My legs have more endurance and strength and I am noticing it on the hills mainly.  Where I once climbed at 10 km/h, I am now at 18 or 19 km/h and holding it for a long time.  It's finally really coming around for me. Oh yeah, Topeka sucked. 
Average Speed: 23.5 Km/h Days Distance: 115.30 Km Total Distance: 2676.95 Km A gross ride today. Not slow or painful or anything, but very moist and dirty.  By the end of the day it took almost 2 hours of cleaning to get all of the mud and dirt out of the bikes and gear.  Still feeling really solid and am happy about that.  I am also really glad that we are finally out of Kansas.  Hopefully the weather will warm up enough for not-to-cold camping.  I say that because right now the way it looks in the money situation we will be camping really soon.  Maybe even tomorrow night.  I am down to $260 with no money coming for at least 6 days.  It's going to be tight for a while.  Really tight... I hate living day to day in wonder of where money is going to appear from.  The two new tubes I bought yesterday both blew today.  Dammit I hate losing new tubes so fast.  So I hope the ones I have will last for a few months.  I am warm for tonight but worried about money.   It's consuming me. 
Average Speed: 19.4 Km/h Days Distance: 46.37 Km Total Distance: 2723.32 Km Kansas is acutally a fairly nice city.  Kansas, Kansas that is. Today we had planned on riding 80 miles...oh my god, I can't believe I just stated a distance in miles, sorry!...anyhow we were supposed to ride about 130 kms and many of them just to get out of the city.  Actually geographically speaking, there are two Kansas City's.  Kansas City, Kansas and Kansas City, Missouri.  They just happen to be so close together, that they appear to be one big-assed city.  It's huge!  Bigger than what I remember Denver being even.  But I didn't have to bike through all of Denver so I can't say fairly. We biked through a rich part of town on bike trails that hugged the road we were travelling and even had part of the road painted off for bikes only, how nice of them.  These were the last peddle strokes we did in Kansas State.  I think nearer to where the Kansas/Missouri state border rolled under our tires, I noticed a drastic and immediate change in scenery. The nice houses with big fluffy lawns were replaced with red and gray cement buildings that were cracked and crumbling all over.  The well placed bike trails turned into warped and full of hole sidewalks.  Which I didn't ride on very long for fear of bending my tire rims.  And then....we hit Interstate 71 South and made the turn back onto the busy freeways. I don't like riding on freeways I have decided.  All vehicles go so fast and drive by so close it makes me nervous.  I hate to think if one ever clipped my bike....but don't worry, I ride so far over to the right side that sometimes I actually hit guard rails with my bike bags.  Speaking of freeway encounters... Coming into Kansas yesterday, we rode in cloud covered darkness because of so much wasted time repairing numerous flats along the ride.  3 of them.  There must be too much dirt inside of my tire and it's popping the tubes all the time.  But riding in that darkness down the interstate was definitely the worst of freeway rides so far.  Totally dark, light coming only from the numerous crazy drivers that pass by us on the inside lane allowing only seconds of the view ahead.  And dirty.  The shoulders have as much debris on them as some gravel roads. Whenever I passed an exit or merging lanes, I would look behind me to see how much time I had to cross.  In the day time it easy.  Depth perception is much better in light than dark.  So with only beams of sharp light becoming more blurry to use as judgement, I would wait for pin sized light, then go.  I'm happy to report, I'm still alive.  Back to the ride... We turned onto I-71s (Interstate 71 South), through the skid area of town.  Bang! Holy fu**, god dammit, shit fu**ers.  Another flat tire.  I'm irrate at flat tires.  Insanely sick of it.  I am approaching 20 flats, 10 new tubes, and my 2nd tire replacement...already.  So on the side of the still wet and muddy interstate, I start walking my bike up towards Pj who meanwhile had taken a wrong turn off the interstate and was no where to be seen.  I caught a glimpse of him crossing a weedy knoll to get back on track.  This whole day turned out to be a really cool sequence of events that led to a legendary night...more on the legend later! Pj and I met up eventually, right near a Sports Store.  How lucky are we?  I mean we are out of tubes again and the last one blows near a sports shop.  So I walked my bike over the ask for some new tubes.  The didn't carry any but knew of a Cycle Shop only about 2-5 miles down Blueridge Road.  And there just happened to be hotels close by as well.  So I decided on another stay in Kansas City.  Missouri this time.  What a difference one night can make on a bike trip. As I was changing over to our last tube to take us to the hotel and bike shop, some crazy guy on an old rickety 10 speed pulls up. "Daaaaaaam, you boyz on some sorta bike ride or somethin?"  Ya something like that.  This guy was definitely from this part of town.   I don't really know what signaled me onto this, but the booze in the brown paper bag that he pulled out of his jacket to drink had something to do with it.  I keep my beerz in my pocket when I'm ridin he says.  Well thank god I had work to do.  This guy wanted to talk and not any of our unresponsiveness or uncomfortable silence would shut him up. So I continued to work on my bike and left the polite chit chat to Pj.  I know he wasn't too happy about it.  And I just continued laughing out loud whenever this guy did.  He thought I was laughing with him...I was laughing at the situation and mainly Pj.  We took off right away after the bike was fixed up....to the Hotel.  This is where the day really began. Earlier on my nervous walk to the laundry mat 2 blocks away, I noticed a biker bar right across from our Hotel with free pool on Sunday nights.  Well it being Sunday, god bless the 7th day, I decided to invite Pj out for a couple of beers.  Well Bike Nites biker bar was awesome to say the least.  Our one beer turned to two, to five, with tequilla shots (training for Mexico?) and you know the story. Next thing I know I'm talking up a storm with Dave, the biker, what a great happy guy.  And then I'm shootin the shit with this county's version of the Hell's Angels Chapter Leader.  I forgot his name but man, we talked like we'd been bud's since childhood.  What a super guy.  A monster too...you could see it in him that his life has some intense stories to tell.  You'd think I'd feel the least bit scared when he told me some of the things he seen and done, but nope.  This guy knew I wasn't any trouble and was just there to have a good time.  And that I had.  Pj, meanwhile, was enticed into a conversation with Dave which I hear was quite funny as well. We had a super time at this bar with the whole crowd being entertained by our loud shenanigans.  The night ended with a super picutre of the partiers in the bar including one girl who must have thought we were taken pics for Girls Gone Wild videos.  The girls have to flash their breasts to get on the videos.  This girl whipped up her shirt and I took the picture.  I would put it on the website but somehow it got erased from the camera.  Neither Pj nor I know how it happened but we both blame each other. 
We awoke to hangovers to strong to overcome today so we took off this day and quickly realized that we have $200 left.  Pj had to borrow it from his mother.  Thank you Marisol, we appreciate the many days of food you just bought us.  I'll try to make more money so Pj doesn't have to borrow from you anymore. So we are forced into camping again but all is not bleak.  Missouri has welcomed us with great gifts and many omens, which I maybe am starting to believe in after reading The Alchemist twice now and contemplating a 3rd.  Tomorrow we will head straight south in search of warmth and palm trees.  So no, we are no longer going to St. Louis and are not worried about the distance we are adding or erasing by going to the Gulf of Mexico and then back up to Atlanta, GA to watch the Dave Matthews concert. I am becoming less worried about the lack of funds right now, something will come up, I know it.  I am still going strong after one day shy of 60 on this trip. Spirits are soaring! 
Average Speed: 28.4 Km/h Days Distance: 99.63 Km Total Distance: 2822.95 Km Well we just couldn't do it. We are in a hotel again.  On todays short trek, short time not short distance, we did 100 km's in 3 hours and 30 mins...that's fast.  But that isn't the reason we are in a hotel, that would be stupid.  On our lunch break, while still thinking we were going to camp, I noticed how quickly I became cold after getting off the bikes.  It was apparent Pj was cold as well, with him saying how he was cold.  My damp clothing, even tho they dry up fairly quickly would not keep us very warm while setting up camp.  That process usually takes about one hour...which is plenty to freeze to death.  Ok I exaggerate but we have become accustomed to instant warmth after our rides by staying in hotels.  But I swear this is coming to an end. Ya, I know you've heard that before.  What's your point? 
Average Speed: 24.0 Km/h Days Distance: 99.88 Km Total Distance: 2922.83 Km Well I don't want to jinx anything... And I know from the experience of 1 day shy of two months on the trip, that I have no idea what will happen in the next 2 days.  But with the daytime weather forecasts by both the Weather Channel and the local news stations (very rare),  it looks as though we are in for sunny skies and temps in the low 20's.  So I am guessing that we will take advantage of those two days and bike on both days even though our past biking history rarely shows 4 biking days in a row, especially with a 7 day total of over 500km's, but it might happen! The only things I can think of to stop it from happening, although as I write this sentence a whole slew of new things that can go wrong pop up in my mind, are condtions too windy or way to hilly.  It's easier to deal with lots of hills that lots of wind.  Unless it's at our back.  So do me a favor if your readin this early enough.  Cross your fingers, knock on wood, channel energy do whatever it is you do to send us luck. I am still feeling stronger even though I found todays ride a little tougher than the last.  To be expected tho as it was wind at our backs and almost all downhill, not like today.  We had a side wind at about 10-15mph.  Pretty strong.  They only slow me down a little, but they do slow me down.  Our ride started out fairly flat today and I was worried as I experienced a small amount of knee pain for the first 41 km.  But we rode the last 59 km's through beautiful scenery.  Rivers, lakes...so many trees finally.  And the last 30 km's we rode up and over the biggest hills we have seen in awhile.  We are actually coming into the Ozark Mountains.  We made our 100 kms unscathed, except for another flat tire, yes mine.  I also noticed my back tire, yes the one with the duct tape holding the tube inside the tire rather than the tire holding the tube in the tire, was wobbling pretty bad.  Upon further investigaion through a process with a lot of tire inflating with a handheld pump which I now hate, it's tough, I found out my tire was done.  Don't know why it's warped (ducttape over a gaping hole!?!) but it is.  So I stole Pj's. Oh yeah, when you click over to read Pj's less inticing journal entry after mine, he will babble on about my incompetance with tubes, tires, and patch-work.  And some of it true, such as how looking back it seemed stupid to put my whole bike in the shower to clean it with hot water and not realize the heat would over pressure my tire to the point of blowing a hole through the side of my tire.  Who thinks of those things, scientists?   But his major error is that my patch-work has not failed me once.  Not even one of my patches have caused anything but a solution.  No mistakes, only getting better too.  Im so good in fact I could probably patch my tire with only a half chewed carrot and a used flyswatter. And one last thing to write about.  I think I must be getting better at reading "the soul of the world" using omens.  Do you recall me writing something along the lines of Missouri welcoming us so well, regardless of the money situation, and that meant the ride through Missouri should be good?  Well today among all the things to look forward to such as; over 500km's in one week, through Missouri in only 6 days and the Dave Matthews concert, I am more extatic about finally being paid.  Nearly $1000 was deposited into my account today by my in a tie for 1st Place for favorite sister, Margaret! Yeeeeeee  frickin  haaaaaaawwww! 
Average Speed: 19.7 Km/h Days Distance: 66.03 Km Total Distance: 2988.86 Km So I was wrong. But being wrong never ended up being so cool before.  We didn't ride 100km's and break 3000km's today, only 66 into a town called Springfield.  Only instead of meeting "The Simpsons" we met Gary and Geoff.  Geoff was the proud owner of the coolest bike shop that we have visited in the whole USA so far.  Check it out his website!  SunshineBikeShop.com.  He was very interested in our trip and was a ton of help to us.  Thanx a ton Geoff.  After stocking us up with bike parts and a bunch of free goodies (spare tubes, patches, and clean shirts), Geoff introduced us to Gary. Gary is a local of Springfield who happens to own his own restaurant, Cartoons Oyster Bar and Grille, at which he took us to and bought us a great supper.  Gary also took us out to see a small bit of Springfield life as well.  Thank you for your hospitality Gary.  We really appreciate it!  At supper we met Doug a good buddy of Garys, and Hoss a work associate of Dougs.  Well over a few beers, we got to talkin with Hoss and he was pretty excited with what we were doing, but not where we would be biking through over the weekend...one day away from Little Rock, Arkansas.  Hoss told us that Arkansas, tho beautiful, would not be the safest of places to bike through.  Well to me that wouldn't be the reason I didn't do it, I am going to bike through Central America, probably a little more dangerous than Arkansas.  But Hoss offered us the opportunity to come to Dallas, TX for the weekend then drop us off where ever we wanted on Monday.  Only one more obstacle to overcome, we couldn't afford it.  Hoss didn't like that either and told us he would take care of us as long as we did the same when he came to Canada.  Deal! So we are off to Texas tomorrow.  Won't hit any of the goals I talked of yesterday, but you know what?  Who cares, I'm going to Dallas! I told you I had no idea what would happen in the next two days.  See ya Springfield and thanx Missouri...you were awesome. 
By far the coolest weekend we have had on the trip so far. Hoss lived up to his promise that this weekend would be an unforgettable time.  It will never be forgotten, nor will the many friends we have made over the last three days.  Hoss, Chad, Todd, Joe, Scott, Jonesy, Lisa, Kristina, Carrie, Sarah and god, so many more.  Oh yeah, and just a note, Hoss turned out to also be the World Bench Press champion.  Over 500 pounds...just a cool extra.  Congrats Hoss, that's awesome. We first met Hoss's roommate and a bunch of their buddies.  Chad, Todd, Joe and Scott.  These would be the four guys we hung out with the most over the weekend not including Hoss tho who partied with us the whole time.  They are all really cool guys too, every one of em.  Except how they thought it was funny to keep saying "eh".  Ya'll know that shit ain't funny. The first place we went to after drinking at Hoss and Chad's was the Goose.  There I managed to piss off some Mexican guy just cause I was talking to some old lady about why she was wearing a Toronto Maple Leafs jersey in Dallas.  Turns out they were playing the Dallas Stars and she came from the game.  No problems arose tho as I was with enough guys that I didn't have to worry.  From there it was off to Micks where we partied it up pretty hard till closing and talked to a whole bunch of new people who kept showing up.  Including a guy named Todd who's house we went to to close out the night.  Todd is a super cool Texan who I partied with a lot the next night, but more on that in a bit. I was all partied out by 5:00am when we took a cab home.  The next day we pretty much lazed around all day watching football and charging up for another killer night.  On this fine evening of about 23 degrees celcius, we once again got a good base going at Hoss's and then headed out to a house party that Chad had heard about.  Hey great work on scoutin this baby our for us Chad!  This place was way better than what I was thinking it would be.  A hint that I caught early as we walked up to the house past BMWs, Corvettes, Audis, Porsches, Mercedes and even a Dodge Viper.  We walked through the open front door into a beautiful house.  The party scene was unreal...catered, free bar with a bartender, and the huge backyard was open for partiers to hang out in the nice weather.  They even decorated with a lighting display that included an outdoor disco ball, and lighting in the trees outside.  The party was full of doctors, lawyers, suits, and hot women all over the place.  I mean, we almost felt out of place....almost.  I felt a little uneasy at first, but quickly realized, that we were all here for one great reason, to have fun, and that is what we did.  Everyone was very nice to us and we met a lot more great people. We left there to two more smaller gatherings with Todd, who was making sure we were having a good time all night.  Todd, thanx man!  For sure you will be in the song I write about our time in Dallas. Hoss and Chad, thanx for letting us stay at your place and showing us around Dallas.  You were right, it was amazing.  Hoss, thanx for taking us here and making this all possible.  I really hope all you guyz do plan a trip down to Costa Rica to see us again.  Keep in touch! We leave again tomorrow out of Shreveport, Louisiana, Hoss is gonna drive us there, with about 1600 km's (1000 miles) left to bike into Tampa Bay, Florida.  About 50-60 km's difference than what we had out of Springfield only much warmer.  Even though a lot of people here said we wouldn't want to leave, I had a funny feeling I would.  I had a great time in Dallas but I am already ready to get back on the road. We made many new friends who I hope we can keep and more more to make.  See ya again soon Texas!  Thanks! 
I keep thinking about the time we had in Dallas and I can't help but be so happy about the decision we made.  Man...Hoss, Chad and Todd, you guys were the greatest.  And now I am sitting here in our hotel room in Louisiana and I finally feel it. "I didn't really know what it was I was looking for until I started looking for it." That is the best way I can describe the way I feel about this trip and I hope this is just the tip of the iceberg.  We are in a whole different world down here in Louisiana and I think it's amazing!  I noticed how once we crossed into Louisiana, something in me sensed a big change.  Not in my mood or spirit, but in my orientation.  Geography is changing if front of my very eyes.  And not only that, the air I breathe and the sounds I hear are now different and my whole body feels it. It's a feeling I have felt before in Mexico the three times I went.  Only this is much  bigger as the feeling lasts longer now that everything is foreign to me.  Even the people are a lot different.  I love the changes in people and attitudes that happens just by going south. Just one small story to tell.  Our hotel was held up tonight!  The way we found out was Pj went to the front office to ask where the closest store was for a late night snack.  He was surrounded by police looking suspicously at him.  But he didn't fit the profile of either of the two black men they were looking for.  Scary eh?  Not really, it could happen anywhere and anytime, we just happened to be there...then. 
Average Speed: 27.2 Km/h Days Distance: 84.71 Km Total Distance: 3073.57 Km A quick and easy ride today to take us over 3000 kms total on this trip. A nice way to break back into biking after the long unexpected break in Dallas.  Louisiana is turning out to be quite nice with how much green is still left in it.  The signs of their weather season changing to fall are minimal.  A few leaves have turned color, fewer have fallen.  Even the road kill has now changed.  Along with cats, dogs, deer, skunks, racoons, weasels and birds, (did I leave any out!?), there are now also snakes, turtles and armadillos.  Sorry, no pictures. Only 2 days left into Baton Rouge, the Capitol of Louisiana, and maybe 4 or 5 until I experience the Gulf of Mexico. Also the first pain in my ass has arisin.  Don't know what's goin on there, but it's startin to hurt. 
Average Speed: 24.8 Km/h Days Distance: 129.09 Km Total Distance: 3202.66 Km A pretty big ride today.  And I can't decide if it was boring or not.  The ride was flat and dead straight.  Like riding a stationary bike for 5 hours.  But the scenery changes around you on the bike.  Rivers, lakes, cotton fields and other types of fields that I haven't figured out whats growin in em yet.  Maybe sugarcane?  I dunno. We also saw an amazing sight today.  There was a marshy area with just thousands and thousands of little black sparrow sized birds swirling around in amazing patterns  There were so many that they blackend the sky.  Unreal...it even made me speak out loud to myself as we passed by them. Everything is so green here...I love it! 
Average Speed: 23.7 Km/h Days Distance: 102.28 Km Total Distance: 3304.94 Km Well we are here in Baton Rouge but not without stories to tell of todays events.  I blew another tire today.  We were about to head over the Atchafalaya River, a large offshute of the mighty Mississippi River, over a tall bridge with highway shoulders littered with metal debris.  I hit one piece and ripped up my new tire horribley.  After changing  my tire and adding all my new "anti-flat-tire" gear we rode pretty much the rest of the way (60km) to just short of the Mississippi where Pj changed his flat tire. Dear Tire Gods, I am not taking any shots at Pj here.  I know and understand that flats happen to all of us and are nothing to poke fun at.  It could happen to anyone.  Please don't punish me. Love Ian But riding over the Mississippi was crazy!  All I wanted to do was stop and take a good look at this massive river.  It's huge!  But there were 4 lanes of busy traffic with no shoulders.  None.  I remember having about 6 inches of room on each side of my panniers.  To my right, a cement guardrail to prevent anything from falling 100 or more feet into the river.  To my left,  nothing but honking (angrily) traffic.  Semis were the worst.  But it definitely is cool to be able to say I did it!  We then rode the "no shoulder" intersate where I was almost hit by a truck.  Like I said in Kansas, I hate freeways. Me and Pj got seperated for a few tense moments while we dodged traffic through merging lanes and I got long wires stuck in my equipment...all in the complete darkness.  Finally we found a hotel to stay at. (Safe?)  We are in what seems to be "the hood" of Baton Rouge.  Blacks outnumber whites here by 20 to 1 here.  Man we stick out like sore thumbs.  A couple of white dudes, rare, on bikes, rarer, from Canada..."you got to be kiddin me!"in a lazy southern accent is a common phrase lately.  But once again, people are amazingly friendly and willing to help out.  God bless you people...really. Our room is a run down apartment that has slimy water, crooked beds, horrible kitchens and unusuable appliances.  This is actually a popular place to live for university students who don't have much money the front desk lady tells me.  I am only a little scared.  Just kidding. Tomorrow we are taking the day off to see Baton Rouge in the daylight.  I hear it's nice.  We will also take some pics of the Mississippi for you all as well! 
Average Speed: 22.8 Km/h Days Distance: 41.71 Km Total Distance: 3346.65 Km Well we still ended up doing 40 km's today.  Not too bad considering it was our day off.  We are now at a campground chain (no I'm not kidding) called KOA.  They are all over the United States, Canada and Mexico.  It's not too bad either.  I mean, I stink and have no really good way to stay clean for long but it's cool.  Nothing really much to report today. All is well. 
We were supposed to leave today, but after waking up late, and eating, I discovered that I had lost my Paypal Mastercard.  It's our means to money on this whole trip.  You see, I work on the internet and my Paypal card is where money is sent on paydays.  So losing that card at a time when it holds over 80% of my available funds is not fun.  It's like biking with one leg. Now I have to borrow money until I get a new Paypal card and I hate asking my mom for money cause I know it comes with many questions, and my justifications of my lifestyle choices compared to my mothers standard of living.  Oh well tho.  I want this trip to continue however which means we are forced into camping and eating at grocery stores.  Now we have to camp in order to live, or go home. Camping ain't so bad. 
I'm sitting outside a Wal Mart on our way to the Hammond KOA, another campground.  Pj and I are in a dire situation.  I lost my Mastercard as you already know, and will not see a new one for at least 2 weeks or 14 days as I now prefer to look at it.  Terms of days rather than weeks.  So much can happen in only one day.  Mom and Dad had to lend me double the amount I asked to borrow and I still ended up with less than what I asked for cause I was so overdrawn on my credit card.  It seems that some of the charges I made on it just hadn't gone through yet.  Whoops....I am learning. Mom and Dad, I am so sorry that you had to put yourselves in a tough situation to help me out.  I feel horrible.  I know I will carry this feeling for many days as well as I have nothing but time to think about how bad I feel and how little I can do to make it right.  I am truly sorry. I do have money now to help the trip continue.  But I now must look at every purchase and ask if it is really necessary.  I hate that but two months of hotels and eating out have put Pj and I in a situation that neither of us are happy about.  Thank god it's warm.  I want to continue on this trip as the ugliness of cold weather, slow biking, and unpleasant scenery have all pretty much dissapeared.  But so has a lot of our money.  I hope to do that we can carry on. I feel the pressure I am carrying right now.  Especially for Pj.  I am sure he doesn't want to go home yet on my account.  I'll do my best from now on to budget wisely and maybe even save a little for the sunny days. 
Average Speed: 25.1 Km/h Days Distance: 57.4 Km Total Distance: 3404.05 Km Happy birthday Dad! A very short and easy ride today into our 2nd campsite and 4th night in a row of camping.  Ya, I think we are finally doing it.  Tent's all the way with maybe the occasional hotel to rest our bodies.  The air mattresses do their job but are no match for soft mattresses, warm sheets, and fluffy pillows.  KOA's are actually quite nice.  they have lots of ammentities including, laundry service, showers, internet access, and grocery stores. It almost feels cozy! 
Average Speed: 26.0 Km/h Days Distance: 98.11 Km Total Distance: 3512.16 Km Today we awoke to unexpected heavy rain.  But my good ole Tarn-2 tent withstood the heavy Louisiana rainfall and kept me dry.  The rain lasted until about 10:00AM which delayed our ride by quite a bit.  We had to wait for it to stop raining before we packed up our gear.  What was supposed to be an 80km ride turned into 100km's into the next KOA.  It misted on us a lot of the way and once again we found ourselves riding on no shoulder highways with lots of angrily honking traffic and in complete darkness at the end of the ride. We are currently less than 10km's away from the Mississippi border and about 50km's from central New Orleans and the 50 km long Cause Way Toll Bridge which spans the length of Lake Pontchartrain.  It's actually the longest bridge in the world...or so I hear.  We are also only a stone's throw away from the Gulf of Mexico.  We can't see it yet,  but can definitely feel it.  The humidity here is unreal.  It was enough to soak my skin along the ride today.  I also noticed that the vegetation keeps getting more lush, green and wet.  Lot's of vines, weeds, small variations of palm trees, and more....it's cool. I am extremely excited to see the Gulf of Mexico tomorrow.  We will actually camp on the shore tomorrow night at Bay St Louis KOA.  Can't hardly wait.  And the rest of the ride into Tampa Bay follows the coast closely so it should be a fabulous next 2-3 weeks. We heard from our good friend Mike Vandenburgh tongiht.  Remember the guy we met way back in Wyoming?   Ya him!  Once again Mike is extending his most sincere welcomes into his home for our stay in Tampa Bay.   A million more thank you's Mike.  This will never go unforgotten. Hoss (Dallas, TX) wants to party again in Florida, his folks live there.  Mike Aurthurs (Manhattan, KS) is booking time off work to come see us.  Joe Scharf (Thunder Bay, Ontario) my great great friend and his family will be in Florida over christmas.  And Pj's friend Tara (Vancouver, British Columbia) is also coming to see us.  WOW! It should be a truly amazing time.  We have nothing but good things to look forward to. I am truly happy. 
Average Speed: 25.5 Km/h Days Distance: 50.76 Km Total Distance: 3562.92 Km Happy birthday Shelby!  I miss you so much kiddo and I love you! Well we made it to the coast of the Gulf of Mexico after a very scenic ride.  Tough, but scenic.  However, we still haven't seen the dam coast.  After setting up camp at the local KOA, in the rain I might add, Pj and I took a walk down the road to view the Gulf Coast for the first time ever.  It rained harder as we  left but we were determined to see it.  The KOA owner said it was only one mile down the road so what the hell...we'll walk.  After walking almost two miles with no Gulf in sight, and soaking wet, we decided to treat ourselves to some seafood, it's inexpensive here and tastes amazing, supposedly. Well that didn't work out either as we couldn't find a seafood place and the small bar we stopped in on had called us a cab but after hours of waiting we figured it wouldn't come.  So we just had a few 2 for 1 beers instead and walked home in the now pouring rain.  We will see the Gulf tommorrow I hope. On the ride out here the wind blew in our faces but it was flat so we were able to keep our speeds over 25 km/h.  We rode past many muddy and weedy rivers (bayous?) that all flowed towards the Gulf.  On one particular stretch two rivers, one on each side of the highway, ran along with us for miles.  There were houses just on the other side of the river to our left side and all of them were built on stilts to save them in case of flooding.  They also all had rickety old bridges crossing the river to their properties.  Many of the bridges looked to old to be standing, weak and were over taken with vines and weeds.  Lot's of things are here...houses, old rusting cars, road signs, telephone poles and even in some cases the wires are also covered in vines and weeds.  It's very cool to see. We also passed the Mississippi border and some epople running a burning torch down the highway.  They had 4 police escorts, a support van, and media taking pics of them.  We're biking over half the globe and we got nothing...go figure. 
Today I took the opportunity to bike 30 kms to see a great big chunk of Bay St. Louis and the Gulf of Mexico.  Highway 90 runs right along the beach for as many miles as we can ride in a day.  I rode right on the shores and I waded through it's shallow waters in low tide.  And I did it all on a sunny day as well which really iced the cake. Hopefully my tan got some darker.
Average Speed: 25.8 Km/h Days Distance: 89.32 Km Total Distance: 3652.24 Km About 80% of todays ride was done right alongside the shores and beaches of the Gulf.  We also rode through some small scale resort/casino towns such as Biloxi.  They are nice but we don't have time or money to stop in.  We decided on a good rest tonight after a week of camping and sprung $44 for a hotel.  I'm scared here and this time I am not kidding. Some big black guy, seemed nice and all, watched as we pulled into our rooms on our bikes.  He actually waited right outside our open door, and I had to close the door in his face before he would leave.  We went out to eat and when we came back, everything was still there, but someone keeps knocking on our Hotel door, don't know who, we didn't answer it but go away!  Hope we are ok through the night.  I'm sure we will be tho. Tomorrow we have to figure out how to cross the 11 km bridge or tunnel.  Both are dangerous and we don't really want to attempt them after riding over other no shoulder bridges...to dangerous.  We'll figure it out. 
Average Speed: 24.3 Km/h Days Distance: 81.06 Km Total Distance: 3733.30 Km Oh boy, what a crazy day.  Pretty early on in the ride we met up with a couple of other touring cyclists like us.  We actually had passed them twice the other day.  I passed them the first time whizzing by but saying hello out loud with thumbs up.  Then we broke for lunch, got back on our bikes and passed them again.  Well today I decided I wanted to talk to them.  But what they told us sent us on a wild 50 km goose chase. Don't worry Bennie and Helga, we didn't even lose one day and in fact found the solution to the bridge/tunnel problem we were telling you about. Bennie and Helga have been touring for about 50 days but have been in Canada, US and Mexico for a bit.  They left Mexico deciding it was too dangerous with the Federales.  But I am pretty sure their heavy German accents coupled with the Federales Spanish vocabulary didn't bode well for conversations with the authorities.  Anyhow, they asked which route we were taking and we showed them our 50 km plan up to Mobile, Alabama and then hope to catch a ride over the bridge or through the tunnel past Mobile Bay. But Helga said he saw that and showed us his route.  It was the same distance biking but avoided the tunnel/bridge scenario and added a ride on a small island named Dauphin Island and also a ferry ride.  So we immediately changed our plans.  We arrived at Dauphin Island after crossing a beauty 5 km bridge with wide shoulders and maybe 9 cars past us the whole way across.  Once there we rode all the way to where the ferry boards.  But the parking lot was full of cars who were simply turning around. No ferry...WHAT?!? Pj tells me he was a sign a while back that said "No Ferry" but he chose to ignore it due to all the passing traffic heading our same direction.  I, probably like the traffic Pj saw, did not see the no ferry sign so I was doubly surprised when Pj told me about it.  So now we are a full day back on bikes just to get to Mobile and deal with the bridge/tunnel situation.  So with knowing that getting angry wouldn't get me anywhere, I quickly got over it and me and Pj set off to try and eat and find a ride into Mobile to correct our big goose chase.  Then we see two cyclers, one with a Canadian biking jersey, cycle up to us and start up a conversation. Adrian is a British Columbian who is in grad school for Marine Biology.  Her biking partner and boyfriend Jason from Louisiana was doing the same.  We we quickly told them about our situation and they quickly offered to help us out by driving us not only to Mobile, but also through the tunnel under Mobile Bay to safety! Adrian and Jason, thank you!  You saved us a day of biking, and when your cycling, that's a lot!  So thank you!  And you got us across Mobile Bay...awesome! So we took them out for supper to say thanks the off to bed....I was so sleepy after this crazy day I almost feel asleep at supper! 
Average Speed: 24.0 Km/h Days Distance: 73.78 Km Total Distance: 3807.88 Km So I think I am superman today cause on the last few days we have been crusin, and I'm feeling like I'm takin it easy!  So today I decided to try and ride the hardest gear I have all the way.  It wasn't that much of a stretch either as the last two days I was pretty much doing it anyways.  But todays ride had strong headwinds and surprisingly enough, hills.  So after 40 km's of actually doing it, my knees were done.  The rest of the way I had to do on easier gears and slow.  I will be fine, I just won't do that again. We are at a KOA campground sitting on a dock on Perdido Bay staring across the waters to the shores of Florida, which is only 5 kms away.  Tomorrow we will be in Florida and are only 8 biking days away from our first long break.  I can't wait. 
Average Speed: 24.7 Km/h Days Distance: 100.25 Km Total Distance: 3908.13 Km Today we crossed the Florida state line.  I knew it was coming but didn't feel excited about it right up until I saw the Florida State sign.  Then I kinda got all giddy and excited.  I can't wait to take a long rest in warmth and comfort. As soon as we crossed into Florida I noticed abrupt changes.  Nicer highways and much better taken care of.  There are also bike paths....ya, bike paths!  Not that Alabama or Mississippi was ugly or bad, but Florida thus far is quite impressive in it's beauty.  Lot's of stuff to see today along the ride which was so beautiful.  It helps me concentrate on something other than the knee pains I have been having.  Not to worry, one day of rest after tomorrows ride will be plenty to heal my pains. We are doing our first free camping in a long time.  Right off the highway on the shore of some bay.  It's actually quite nice.  The only bad thing was the 2 inch long freaky bug that scared the shit out of me in my tent.  The big ugly bastard was crawling on the inside roof of my tent.  I went to put on my biking gloves to get rid of it.  I didn't really feel like grabbing it with my bare hands, and was surprised by another of the same bug only twice as big and ugly right in the palm of my glove, which was in my pannier.  How the hell did something that big get in there?   Shit....it's gonna be tough to sleep tonight. 
Average Speed: 24.5 Km/h Days Distance: 112.56 Km Total Distance: 4020.69 Km We broke 4000 km's today! Well first we went an whole bunch of extra kilometers cause whoever is in charge of putting up the signs for "bridge out" situations was on vacation.  Not one sign to tell us that a whole bridge, not just one or two lanes, but the whole thing was gone.  The construction workers were replacing the dam thing.  Good thing the scenic route was beautiful otherwise the whole thing would have been a great waste of time! Then Pj seemed to be leading me to a place without really knowing where he was going.  It just turned out that where we were going didn't even exist anymore.  This actually was funny as it was in the 2002 Edition of the KOA Directory....what the hell is that? But as we were figuring stuff out in a parking lot, I met a guy named John who told us of a great place named Foghorns bar and he even showed up for a few drinks himself.  What a great way to start a day off, and end a great week of biking! 
Average Speed: 24.6 Km/h Days Distance:  110.54Km Total Distance:  4131.23Km It was a long ride but very nice.  We are along the shores of the Gulf of Mexico still but the scenery changes always.  Beach towns turn quickly to resort towns and then into small fishing villages.  Palm trees were replaced by towering pines today which was very nice to bike through.  However it wasn't enough to keep me from concentrating on my knee pains.  They are still with me and are now slowing me down a bit.  I will start trying to experiment with different postions on my bike. 
Well we didn't even finish one kilometer when the thing that you never want to happen on a bike trip happened.  Pj was in a car/bike accident.  We had just left for our days ride into Alligator Point when a car turned right while Pj kept going forward.  Since the driver turned so suddenly in front of Pj, he had no time to turn and smacked right into the side of the car who cut him off.  I didn't really get to good of a view of the whole thing although I was riding right behind him and knew immediatley when this happened. My heart went into my stomach and I raced to see Pj getting up from the ground.  His panniers were all over, his front bike tire was mangled, and his face and hands were starting to bleed, but I knew pretty quickly that he was ok.  Now what about the bike?  Well, immediately a whole crowd of people came running over to either say they saw what happened or to offer help.  We were offered food, rides to places, but best of all a super guy named Eric offered to fix Pj's bike and give us a place to stay for the night while we sorted ourselves out.  So we took him up on his offer. Turns out Eric and Kate are also touring cyclists, from British Columbia, and they know a lot about fixing bikes, and everything else for that matter.  So we hopped in with him and Kate, and their dog Noah.  They were a wealth of help and comfort to Pj and I.  Thank you guys so much for everything that you did for us.  Hope to see you on the road some day...who knows, maybe we will plan something! For now we are safe and warm at Eric and Kates.  My knee is actually hurting quite a bit again due to a small but quick ride we all took to a local seafood place.  Only a 30 km ride and with no panniers, but we raced and it quickly dissagreed with my knee.  I am not sure if we will leave tomorrow or stay here another day.  Depends on the knee. 
Average Speed:  26.9Km/h Days Distance:  77.53 Km Total Distance:  4208.23Km We decided to leave today at about 2 PM.  I didn't even wake up until 1 but my knee was only hurting a little so I decided to ride.  Heck, only 5 more riding days into Tampa Bay where we will start our month long fiesta! I think I have figured out how to stop a lot of the pain in my knees...shift my seat forward a half-inch.  I rode at the top of my seat for most of the ride today and my knees didn't hurt so hopefully that will be the answer to that problem. I am a little upset today as well as I found out that I have lost my journal in which I write every night.  Well, I left it back at Eric and Kates house.  It will be only 5 or 6 days until I see it again, I will ask them to mail it to Tampa, but I love writing in it every night.  For now I will do my journal entries right into the computer I guess.  Oh well. We arrived late into the KOA at Alligator Point.  But the coolest thing is a walk to a looong pier that goes way out into the Gulf.  The night is super black but the stars are brilliant and bright.  It's an amazing view. Don't forget, it's a new month....December entry time! YAY! 
Average Speed:  23.9Km/h Days Distance:  115.20 Km Total Distance:  4323.43Km It's funny cause we are only now 3 days away from our one month vacation.  We will have biked about 4600 kms in just under 3 months.  That's just shy of the distance across Canada from east to west.  But I have mixed emotions about the whole thing.  I am very excited about the holiday that we are about to take.  I am beginning to miss home quite a bit.  I am also becoming very tired of living always worried about where money is going to come from.  But I want to keep going.  It's actually quite tough mentally right now.  I hope this holiday changes things up quite a bit. Today we rode quite far and with the adjustment that I made on my seat this morning, I think I may have found the problem for the pain I have been having in my knees.  My seat was maybe an inch to far back.  I had very little pain today even though we were riding into the wind the whole way. Not much else to tell other than we passed the German cyclists again today.  Good luck getting to Key West guys!
Average Speed:  26.0Km/h Days Distance:  92.53 Km Total Distance:  4415.96Km Boring... We are inland Florida now and it's really nice and all, but the stretch of highway we rode today was straight and flat which makes for a boring repetitive ride.  My knees are feeling better and I am having very little pain now.  I really think the seat adjustment is working well.  We are still broke and I am wondering where the hell I am going to get the money to continue on this trip.  That is the most important thing to me.  Pj keeps telling me of the great time he wants to have on our break, and I am in 110%, but we have no money to party and the little we do have is already spent on the Dave Matthews concert we are going to.  At least our accomodations in Florida are going to be free. It's not fun to be the sole financeer on a trip for two with expensive travel habits....well it is when you can afford it! I am now also toying with the idea of taking a ferry from South Florida to Cancun, Mexico.  It's only $100/person and will put is in "el cheapo" land.  That's only one of two great reasons I want to do it.  The other is that I don't want to repeat the section of the Gulf that we have already done. 
  Hello to all my family, friends, and to the silent readers of my journal entries.  I have thought long and hard about what I want to write in my final words for the MeIsUs trip that has ended so shortly after it began.  Yes, it is over.   What happened?  Well...money was the determining factor I am sure.  I always thought you could tell a person that you were going to pay for everything and that would be enough to keep them happy.  Nope.  I ignored the fact that Pj would not always be happy doing the things that made me happy.  What I failed to realize was that when there is only a limited income, and after covering the basic needs of food, shelter and biking parts, that also covering the costly wants of keeping all present parties happy would become to much.  And because of that a resentment towards each other would start to find a place in both of our hearts.  But for too long it was unclear why.   I didn't realize that a delicate but important balance existed.  Fun is not an option on this bike trip...I was trying to make it one due to my constant worries of no money.  Why didn't we have any money?   We both made ignorant mistakes such as leaving when it was too cold.  Neither of us could fight the battle after a days biking to get out of cold, wet sweaty clothes, then set up camp in the dwindling daylight, cook, eat and clean up all in the chilly night air, then get a good nights rest only to do it all again.  We opted for the ease and warmth of more costly hotels and eating out.  Night after night this mistake ate at our funds and my monthly income.   And that was the dreaded mistake that instigated the end of this trip in my mind.  The $1000 - $1300 USD per month on hotels plus whatever it cost to eat out was our fun money...gone.  So when Pj talked of doing anything fun, I would cringe right away...."but what about the trip?"  The trip became unenjoyable for both of us.  But I couldn't do anything about it.   I easily grew tired of Pj's not being happy and my not understanding why. In my mind he was being selfish.  Afterall, I was being so generous by paying for the whole goddam unenjoyable trip, why couldn't he at least be thankful to me for that.  Ahh....just cause I am paying for something doesn't make it enough....point well noted.   So time went on in this fashion until I could no longer stand it.  Early in December, I awoke tired of not saying anything.  If this trip was to continue, which I was not sure I wanted it to, things had to change.  When I spoke to Pj informing him of my situation, he informed me that his quiet plans to go home were already in effect and he was waiting for the right time to tell me.  Well, that was all I needed to know.  The phone calls home began...the trip was over.   Pj, I am sorry for the things I was too ignorant to see.  I hope that you know and believe if I had more money, we would have done every fun thing that not only I wanted to do, but you wanted to do as well.  I now see why you were becoming angry with me and I think I have a better understanding of it.  I am sorry for that.  Truly sorry.   I wish you the best of luck and hope to be able to sit down for a few cocktails with you when I come home from my adventures so we can drown the shit that we went through with some Crown Gingee's.   My experiences on this trip.   I want to start by saying that I am truly dissapointed that I did not accomplish my goal, yet enlightened by the lessons that I will take with me.   I left on September 7th, 2002 with a fire burning in my soul that would rage until the trip was coming to it's last kilometers somewhere in the jungles of Argentina.  That was what was important to me.  Anyone who talked to me would attest to the truth of me saying the only thing that could bring me home and end this trip prematurely would be a death in the family.  I was ready to bike.  I was gullible.   It wasn't to be able to say that I had biked 25,000 km's or that I had taken a two year vacation or anything of such empty greatness.  My only reason for getting on my bike was to explore the world that I live in but am so nieve about.  I wanted to learn.  I wanted to immerse myself in another world where people look, talk, and act differently than what I am accustomed to.  I wanted to go to sleep every night scared, excited and wondering what tomorrow was going to bring, what problems, what gifts, what adventures.  I wanted to absorb other cultures, ways of life and the problems that many North Americans don't have but so much of the other parts of the world live with and the simple joys in life that other worlds can take so much happiness out of but I have learned to expect.   Instead, I find myself sitting in a beautiful little beach house, surrounded by the commercialisms of hotels, condos, fast food stores, and comfortable vacation style living that I already knew before I left on this trip and I am saddened by the thought that I will not be bicycling any further.  I will be shipping myself, my bike, and my equipment back home without even scratching the surface of my desires.  I am surrouned by new beauty, but my heart is left full of desire to see more.   The ride through the small part of Canada and the almost 4000 km's of the USA have lasted three months.  It was not at all like I had expected it to be.  I never was expecting anything worthy out of biking through 5000kms of varied similarities and subtle differences of my surroundings and lifestyle as compared to the past 25 years of my life.  I was actually chalking the whole distance from Edmonton to the border of Mexico up to getting in shape and learning how to be efficient on my bike.     But surprisingly to myself, in that time I have learned volumes about the way that others view me.  But more importantly, I have learned how I view myself.  I can differentiate between what other people think is going on in my head, what really is and understand the incredible gap that exists.  I am not like most people.  I also learned that I have the attitude and skill set to be more free than most people will ever be.  I can dream, and I can live out my dreams.  I have the time, the money and now the courage to do so....it's only a matter of taking that first real step towards doing it.    So with that, I am satisfied in the unexpected experiences I have gained from the distances I have travelled.  I am at peace that I am no longer going to continue this particular bike trip.  I have new plans for the next few months of my life, and more plans for the months to come after those few.  I know I will do what I say this time as I have finally felt what it feels like to say you are going to do something, and do it....well kinda!.   My holidays in Florida were great and I got the opportunity to start a new relationship with a new friend.  Thanks Mike.  I think this will be a lifelong friendship that will bring many laughs and smiles to both of us.   I will see one of my two best friends, Joe Scharf, in only two more days.  We will celebrate the coming of a new year together in the grandest of fashions.  I will also fly with Joe back to a town where I once lived, Thunder Bay, Ontario.  There I will rejoin a band that I once played in who, in my abscence, have recorded two albums and started what could turn out to be a successful career in music.   If things don't work out there, my plans are to go back home, make some money, and hop back on my bike to satisfy the fire that will burn in my soul until it is quenched by the waters that reside on the coasts of southern Argentina!   Bon Voyage all!  My journey down this path has come to a fork in the road, I am not stopping, only changing directions! I will keep you posted!   Ian Herculson  

  Well for those ones that don't know me, hi! :o) I am Kati, and 33 years old. I live in Vancouver, BC and am originally from Montreal. I work here in BC as a nurse and really enjoy the mild weather, the ocean and the mountains, the laid back lifestyle outside the hospital. Biking has been one of my passion since my first bike trip in 1999 where I cycled the Oregon Coast. (Mind you I absolutely HATE having greasy hands, so if you do like playing with bikes and you are single and under the age of 40, e-mail me privately ;-)... I also diligilently train all year round, especially running and lifting weights at the gym, a little bit of skate skiing (cross-country) and snowshoeing. The other bike tours decent enough to mention were the Pacific coast in 2000 (see this journal on this site) and also I cycled the South Island in New Zealand in 2001, for 6 weeks, also solo and self supported. I bike to deserve my food at night and the chocolate I eat during the day. I also bike for the endorphins and the sense of satisfaction it give me of having worked out my muscles. I bike the world for new panoramas and for the pictures and souvenirs I will bring home. I also bike because I get incredibly motion sick if I take a bus or if I get into a car and I am not driving. My mind starts flying when I cycle for several hours at a time and I get something to say when I get to sit down and log another entry in my journal. Travelling makes me happy and free. Not travelling or not having any trip in mind makes my brain like swiss cheese. So when I will be in France I should have a big revelation about where I should go next...
  The details are getting a bit clearer... But in the same time an addition to my trip: meet Jean-Franois Bdard. He was the first one to e-mail me on this journal's guestbook. Offered to be my principal mechanic on this trip and to make sure my nurse's hands would remain sparkling clean. What else did he promise? Hehe... He will read this so let's see... He did say he'd wash the dishes and make sure I have a good time on this journey, if only I agreed to take him along... Jean-Franois has been touring since the early 1990's and is a seasoned bike tourer and has been down the Alps, the Pyrenees and also all over Italy. (If he wants to go back there, that's a good sign to me.) He gave me references and assured me he wasn't an axe murderer, and next thing I knew, he was looking for plane tickets, made a map of the proposed itinerary and discussed what I wanted to see and what was feasible (I didn't go that far myself, just thought I would wing it once there). By the way for those of you skeptics that such a partnership could work, we agreed that if either one of us didn't have a good time we would go each our separate way, but Jean-Franois assured me that it wouldn't happen. So here are the plans, so far. I am landing in Paris. Visit with my sister for a couple of days. Cycle towards Strasbourg. Then down the Black Forest in Germany to Zrich  where I will meet Jean-Franois and get acquainted. We will cycle down Switzerland, towards Bern and then visit my aunt in Cheyres which is close to Fribourg. Then south along Lake Leman and reach the French Alps and start climbing and admiring the wonderful sceneries. We have chosen some of the toughest passes but I am sure they will be rewarding. I have ordered good weather so my pictures can be just spectacular, as long as the views... Then we will eventually emerge in Nice, maybe a slight detour to the Italian border, and Monaco, just for fun and we will follow the Riviera to Toulon, where probably we will have enough of high traffic and we will go inland and try maybe some wineries in Provence, and the notorious Mont Ventoux. Then Avignon and Carcassonne will be highlights, along with Andorra part of the Pyrenees. In Spain we will remain inland, checking Lerida and taking the ferry in Valencia if we still have time to go there, if not, we will end up in Barcelona where in either place we can take the ferry to Palma de Mallorca where my brother and his children live. That will be the end of my tour, returning to Paris by plane, likely. Jean-Franois will still have 2 more weeks and will return to Zrich by bike through the Pyrenees. The approximate distance for my trip is 3550 km.  This is quite a change of plans for me and I am excited about my trip, looking forward to it!!! Hasta la vista!!!
My mountain bike has been getting so old in the last 2 weeks that all I have in mind is to replace it with a brand new Trek 520!!! I recently went biking with a friend who has a road bike and I had my mountain bike with 4 panniers and I loaded them with all my nursing textbooks (big bricks). Of course Debbie was faster than me, and of course I was tired after the ride... And of course all I had in mind was that if I was to ride another trip with my old Norco, I would only partially enjoy my trip as I would use extra energy to pedal and propell the beast. The last time I went to my local bike shop to discuss what needed to be done on the Norco, I noticed this Trek 520 that was on a roller, just for me to try on... When I say just for me, this is it! This bike has been brought into the store for me to see and drool... Well it worked... It's all I have been able to think about in the last few days, and will probably end up buying this baby so I can enjoy my trip to the max... Jean-Franois still talks about making the dishes and also drools on my cooking as this is the deal we have made. He still doesn't know how bad of a cook I am but... shhhhht! It's a secret! ;-) In the meantime I am trying to practice on myself and the good news is that I haven't poisoned myself yet! The route hasn't changed much but I am possibly thinking about taking a train to Strasbourg by the German border so I can spend time on cycling more scenic routes like the Black Forest in South West Germany before I join Jean-Franois in Zrich. This would allow me to spend an extra day with my sister in Paris and visit Strasbourg and around which sounds more scenic, touristic and interesting than in between Paris and Strasbourg...
The countdown is on. Life is good. I am happy. I am screaming to the world that I am on my way to a big adventure that will take me up mountain passes, down valleys, across vineyards, amidst family, and also along the Mediterranean... I wish this feeling could last way beyond this trip!  So I bought my new Trek 520...  A  gem, especially compared to my old mountain bike that sure took me places but that was ready to retire. Not perfect yet, I still need to do adjustments and more training so the intimacy in between the bike and me gets beyond belief, and last vital details like adjusting the front ring set so I can climb the Alps passes in confidence. This is all last minute, and not the optimal thing to do, to buy a new bike on the eve of such a big trip, but to me it is worth it, and I am doing it. The other drawback for me at this point is all the expenses that surround the big purchase... New pump, front and rear racks, break pads, shoes, etc... It's unbelievable... For that reason too, I can't wait to be gone, because I know I will be careful with my expenses once I am out of here... I will tighten the purse and write down what I spend so I can add it all up and say at the end of my trip how much it all exactly cost. Stress will accompany me until the end as I am having the practicum part of my chemotherapy administration course at work. At first I requested to have it postponed until I come back but it was not possible, so there... I will have to stay focused until the last minute. The good part is that I have found a baby sitter for my parrot, a good thing but a bit expensive. Oh well...    On the planning and partnership news, I have bought a train ticket to Strasbourg to cut the likely boring distance  in between Paris and Strasbourg. So I will spend some time biking around Strasbourg, and then  will meander in the Black Forest in Germany all the way to Zrich where I will meet Jean-Franois on the 5th of June. The rest of the route is pretty much the same but we have decided to keep options open, and see as we go. When we will be farther down south and west, we can see if we have time or not to make it all the way to Valencia.  I hope we will. I want to see it all. Savor the moment. Be totally delighted by anything and everything. Be happy... And I am not dreaming... This is all true!!!
About the title... Yeah, I think I killed a snake... One fine afternoon this week I thought I'd go for a long ride with my nursing textbooks. I decided to go along the Fraser river and... all of a sudden I found myself on a gravel path, more like for mountain biking but still ridable. I was starting to regret my choice thinking I would get my chain all dirty when this snake, feeling a little daring decided to cross the trail, as I was passing by. Startled by the sight of this 3 feet long cold blodded invertebrate, I slow down but forgot to get off my cleats and yeah, you got it. In the same time I step on the poor thing I fell in the ditch, fortunately on a thick layer of high grass that made my fall smoother. The noise coming out of my throat was unrecognizeable- must have startled everybody around. The thing was I fell on the same side than the snake was going, so I was falling on the snake itself... I didn't check out, or asked whether Mr Snake was ok, but rather checked out my body parts and my brand new bike who just took its first fall, a memorable one...The fall gave me trouble on my back, and I still don't know how much impact this will have in the next week. I like to believe I will be ok.  In the meantime, the preparations are going well. The bike got its new front chain ring, the front and rear racks are installed, the gears are well adjusted, I have brand new brake pads that are supposed to last me for life. I would like to thank my local bike shop "Caps" for doing the work for me and being quite understanding of my needs. The bike touring population gets usually sketchy service from their bike shop as mountain biking is what sells right now. Otherwise, life as usual. I worked a fair amount this last week, and I am hoping to "take it easy" until I leave... (Yeah, right!). Everything seems almost ready for a wonderful adventure...
   The ride to the airport was uneventful if only a little wobbly if I tried to get off the bike seat and some curious looks from rush hour drivers desperate to get home after a week of hard work. It felt good to ride, had a good sweat leaving my home as there are a couple of good hills that sent me right of the bat on the smallest geaar available but I did it. Well that's a start! I was thinking of the Alps, and how on earth I decided to go biking there!!! Will I be able to conquer? Making it to the airport was one thing, getting organized for the plane was step 2... Dismounting the bike, I had some trouble with the pedals as they haven't been greased up real well but I did it. Long wait in queue to get my boarding pass and to leave my luggage in good hands, my rear panniers, tent, thermarest, sleeping bag along with bike shoes got weighed at 20.8 kg. I would take the front panniers and the handle baar bag as carry on and so didn't get charged for the bike as it got counted as a piece of luggage... Relief... Now I could relax...    The flight itself was uneventful, if only I could have been spared of a very stinky neighbor that arrived and took the very next seat at the last minute... You have to believe me I haven't been able to sleep because of that. This guy worked outside moving stuff all day and never had a shower... And every time he lifted his arms in the air I wanted to be sick... The features of the airplane were quite cool, as every seat had their own small tv with different channels so we could take our picks of what we wanted to watch... I watched 3 movies that night and got up a dozen time for fresh air. Finally we made it on firm ground in London and I had to make my connection to Paris in 45 minutes hoping that my bike would follow too... I almost forgot my helmet at the security check and noticed it was missing just as I was going in the plane. I had to backtrack and fortunately found it and got back on the plane. We were all in the plane on time but we waited and waited and waited... We had an hour delay because the luggage count was incorrect, I suppose too many pieces for the said number so everything had to be unloaded and reloaded while we would wait patiently. I was very tired by that time and almost fell aslep for the first time and then we were warned to buckle up as we were finally leaving. London-Paris is a fairly short flight, they barely had time to serve us drinks, and again I was on firm ground, a little emotionnal to meet my sister whom I didn't see in a few year. My bike came last and really I was getting worried that it wouldn't come at all but it looked intact, and then I could get out and be greeted by my sis and her partner Mario. We worked on the bike a bit and noticed that the rear tire wouldn't inflate... Would that count for the first flat tire of the trip??? And then we weaved our way through the shuttle then the train that would lead us towards their appartment in the 10th Arrondissement. By that point I was getting tired at times but still wired so we went out for dinner at a mexican restaurant where we got smoked real good by other people's bad habits... That is where my sister told me she was expecting a baby for the end of the year... What a news to learn to start a trip to Europe!!! :-)       
Breakfast in Paris is twice as cool. Mario went to pick up fresh croissants and fresh chocolate bread and we feasted on that along with orange juice and peanut butter toasts with maple butter (at least for me). Well the peanut butter is a north american delicacy and as my sister asked me to bring some. I did and obliged to help her with using the first pot...  Sunday morning in Paris is market day, so she and I went for a stroll along Canal St-Martin amd weaving through the dog shit (yeah, as blunt as that) on the sidewalk we made it to the march de la Bastille in maybe half an hour. There we fought showers on and off, fought the crowd the crowd and found some fruits and vegetables like cherries,nectarines and some savory pastries for our lunch. Lunch... yummy...         After our wonderful meal we decided to head for the bed... for a well deserved nap... OK... My sister is pregnant, and I am on jet lag... Make sense? Then I woke up by 3 and we all went for a nice stroll to the heart of Paris, to discover the Cathedrale Notre-Dame which is absolutely fabulous with its impressive facade and all the details everywhere... I found my chin close to my toes and took a lot of pictures. We would have liked to go up the towers but the line up was already beyond the one hour wait so we decided to carry on. Next in line was a little walk along the Seine river and crossed another bridge, le Pont des Arts and faced le Louvre, where the Mona Lisa smiles somewhere on one of the floors... For today we would walk outside and visit the interior court, viewing the statues and the architecture which is fantastic... No wall is left plain. The most intricate details cover every parts in a way very appealing to the eye, making me wish I was a princess...      We saw the infamous Pyramid in the inside court which doesn't fit much in the picture but oh well then headed towards "les Tuileries" which is some other gardens.           The infamous Champs Elysees came next as we made our way towards the Arc de Triomphe where a ceremony commeemorating the passage of the president Bush took place so we weren't alowed to go even close to it. Very impressive though. By that time we were all tired of all the walking, the negociations of the sidewalks with people, dog shit, strollers and police, and two of us had to pee badly, and so we headed for hot chocolate and bathroom deal at "La brioche doree" and think about what to do next... The plans were for food. When the mood gets low, get food... That is the motto... We settled for pizza, so we headed to a place known by my sister at "La defense" which is a square that is the most futuristic and quite anachronistic whith the idea people have of Paris. The pizza place was closed so we went for thai food at the other end of town. It was quite yummy... I couldn't believe I would be able to eat past 8 PM but I managed without having my stomach screaming to the world that it needed attention.. Careful though for when I will be biking all day... After a good meal like that we headed for the Eiffel tower, which happened to be all lit and majestuous... We had a serious photo session then walked right under it and to the other side to watch the moon rise and the view from a small hill. Really nice wrap up of a wonderful day...        
We made a big backpack full of stuff we could possibly need for the day and this time put on my cycling shoes instead of my sandals (hell with my no sports shoes with nice pants rule) for comfort. Paris is a fashion city and I kind of felt like I could do a bunch of shopping for clothes and other delicacies of a city girl but they don't fit in my panniers so just let it go...  Our stroll took us in the rich neighborhood and we did a bit of window shopping until 12:30 when my sister had an appointment with her doctor. I  was glad to go with her and observe the normal life in Paris. There was much more people in the streets of Paris this time around as it was a working day and I felt a bit dizzy by all the noise of the street, the circulation and the moppeds and motorcycles that were playing stunts on the road just to make it wherever a little faster. I saw one of those moppeds driving in traffic and in the same time talking on the cell phone... As for biking in Paris, I have been strongly discouraged to biking here, but people do. I haven't seen anybody wearing a helmet as of yet, so it sounds that I will be the only one in France let alone in Europe that do but oh well. I will protect my brain.  We went for lunch after fighting the heavy crowd. We went to Le Printemps which is a nice department store and on the sixth floor there is a dining room with a dome roof that is named historical. Apparently the roof has been removed piece by piece during the second World War and put back in 1973. I had quiche and some kind of decadent chocolate mousse with english cream, which i only picked because it was one Euro more with my menu. Quite yummy. Oh-Oh better start biking soon...        Then Marika and I went for the Cathedrale Notre-Dame again to see if we could go up on the towers and have a glimps of the city. There was one hour wait time for that and the groups had priority and could jump queue... So instead we went for the free indoors visit and admired the very impressive stainglass and the painted roofs. I asked my sister if she wanted to confess all her sins to the priest but she declined. As for me I don't have any. :-)    Then we went on the thankfully quieter ile St-Louis to admire the view on the Seine and also stroll on the narrow roads and take a rest. I found some Pepsi for the first time of the trip and toasted my sister... We were quite tired at that point and we decided to take a rest in the park behind the chathedral and sip our drink. Ths sky was very threatening and we knew it would rain sometime tonight.      Marika wa looking for a present and I was looking for some propane-butane for my stove so we strolled around the Latin Quarter and window shopped. The French people have really good taste when it comes to shopping and I was drooling quite heavily. I think I overpaid what I bought however, especially a metal cup that I did buy for 5,5 Eeuros. That is theft! We walked around some ruins that were fenced- I think it was a medieval museum and I noticed this man that was kneeling in the middle of the sidewalk (everybody had to make a detour to avoid him) with this little cardboard sign saying "J'ai faim" (I'm hungry). It is sad to see that people come to that in the  world. That is a universal problem that I will not solve today but it is always disturbing for me to see. It started raining slowly as we were heading towards the metro (subway) then the whole sky fell on us as we had only a small broken umbrella to share. My pants got wet to the knees and the thunder and lightening joined for a son et lumiere party. It has been rainning every day since I am here and started regretting not brining my gore-tex jacket along on my trip.  The evening was quiet and Mario and Marika made a wonderful ostrich meal with a nice little sauce and also mashed potatoes and salad... Thanks guys... Later that evening I prepared my bike for the big odyssee, remembering I came for that, biking  around France, south Germany, Switzerland and Spain... I feel a bit nervous of heading out on my own after hearing the stories of theft by my sister, but it seems to relate more to Paris. I have to be careful with my belongings always keep an eye on the bike. So Am I suposed to take the bike for a pee or pee with my bike??? I will find out and let you know.   
Came back to the appartment with a piece of pizza and a Diet coke and decided to go for a visit of the Opera, the one I took pictures of yesterday from the outside. I negociated my way just fine in the subway by myself and soon was inside the said opera and admired the walls and ceiling architecture and took lots of pictures. I hope that some of them will turn out fine.          I was excited to leave the appartment with my loaded bike and leave for the train station, la gare de l'est. My sister recommended me to walk the bike there but I was itching to cycle and wanted to experience the said nightmare of cycling in Paris. It ended up just fine, but I experienced some problems with the gears on the way and remembered that I had declined Mario's offer to go down on the street and test drive the bike yesterday... Ha! Putting the bike on the train was a bit of a challenge as there is a huge step but someone volunteered to help so I was thankful. My wagon was different from the one I put the bike in so I locked the bike and went in the search of my assigned seat. The French trains are fairly tame, with little closed cubicules accomodating 6 passengers in each one. I sat by the window, and had a look at the surroundings. At first, getting out of Paris was basically a cluster of train tracks criss-crossing but soon enough we were out of there and crossing lands of greens and little villages. I ate my sandwich, wrote my journal and had a little talk with my neighbors... Nothing to write home about. I was glad I changed my mind and didn't cycle from Paris to Strasbourg, because it looked like very ordinary terrain, with not much to cater to the cyclo-tourists... We made it to Strasbourg exactily on time, and again got help to unload the bike and found an elevator to escape the flight of stairs leading to the street level. Something that sounds very obvious in Canada, like having wheeelchair accessible areas like train and subway stations, levelled sidewalks at street crossings and adapted building access is a struggle here in France. I wonder how wheelchair bound people weave their way in here...  The sun was setting, it was getting dark, but I kind of knew where to go, and I clipped my little red flashing light to my clothes before heading out towards the campground. An angel came to rescue me when I got puzzled at an intersection and lead me in the right direction. She was cycling the same way than me so we had a little chat when we could cycle side by side. There was nobody at the campground reception so I sneaked beyond the gate and set up camp under a tree in the dark. Went to brush my teeth and first cultural shock of the French campgrounds, the toilet paper is outside the stalls, so you have to take some before you go, and estimate how much you need right... I will know for next time! This first night camping was quite meaningful to me as it marked the begining of my adventure...
I must have left by 9AM maybe a bit later, delayed for putting my rear panniers upside down and noticing only once I tried to pedal, my feet hitting the outside pockets of the panniers usually on the rear of the bike. A little rusty, I'd say? After paying my dues at the office, I looked for food and found a bakery within 5 minutes, savored a chocolate croissant with a hot chocolate. Little errands ensued and I decided I would bypass Strasbourg for now and visit after my little Alsace tour. I needed a bike shop to adjust the derailleur problem, and as I was getting away from Strasbourg, I was hoping to find something on my way south in a little town. Exiting the town was uneventful, sharing the moderately busy road with other drivers who gave me lots of space to maneuver which allowed me to look around and enjoy the sceneries. My whole day consisted in getting in and out of little towns, some prettier than others but each with quite a distinctive character of Alsace. In between town, vineyards, all the way to the horizon...     Let's talk about the little towns. Most of them had a medieval flair, with cobblestone in the core. Houses had a German influence being so close to the German border, and all of those properties were so well kept that you could tell that it's inhabitants were very proud of them and working hard to preserve them. Churches were of course in the heart of the village, and noticeable form far away. Fountains were also in each of those towns, providing me with fresh and cold water without having to ask anybody to give me some. The fountains themselves were a pride with gargoyles, statues and flowers, something I have never seen in Canada really. Each of them was unique and well located. Of course wine is a main preoccupation for Alsacians along with tourism I presume. Every village has its grower and offer wine tasting and also visits of the winery. You could go from village to village and taste all day if you wanted. It could have been a trip on its own, going from village to village, and buy the best bottles of wine... I was tempted to stop and taste, buy a bottle but just for myself sounded ridiculous, bulky and heavy. After only one glass, I giggle by myself. The bottles of wine can be as cheap as 2.80 Euro and it would be quite normal to buy a 500 ml of Pepsi for 2 Euro... Go figure.      I had a good training for the Alps today as I climbed 2 decent hills, the first one being Mont St-Odile, which is a religious place on top of a hill of 765 m. There is a church up there and the gift shop sells lots of religious gadgets. There was nothing difficult to this climb, just a steady 11 km uphill. I stopped for a 15 min lunch on the way there. I was congratulated for my efforts and one man took a picture of me for the posterity... There was a fair amount of sport cyclists that I met on my way down and I think they were surprised to see a girl riding a loaded bike up there.    The second hill was to visit a castle. Jean-Francois had recommended me to go see for myself, it is called 'le chateau du Haut-Koenigsbourg' and like many castles in Europe they like to make them with a panoramic view to prevent the enemy to sneak in from behind and steal all the princesses. It stands at 755 m and when I arrived up there by 6 or 6:30 PM it was closed for the day... I could have been disappointed but by 6:30 PM, all I wanted was to go down the hill, find my way to a campsite and have a nice warm shower. The one I got was named Camping Pierre de Coubertin  after this guy that revived the Olympic Games (I think) a few years ago... The campsite has hot showers, dishwashing and laundry facilities and sells a few things for the morning, the essentials like 'pain au chocolat' (chocolate bread) and croissants, and the unforgettable baguette. For diner I had some pasta with tomato basil sauce, mushroom, zucchini and emmental cheese. Hot chocolate and GORP for dessert. (Good Old Raisins and Peanuts) That evening I phoned Jean-Francois and happily talked about my experience in Alsace and also about that bike shop I stopped to who's owner didn't want to fix my gears under the pretext that my front rings must be worn out. (I explained that this bike was brand new). How insulting.  In one week we would meet face to face and start biking as a team, and I thought that by that time I would be ready for company.  By 10 PM I got very tired and as it was finally dark, retired in my quarters to sleep before another fabulous day biking...
         The bike happened to ride so much better. The brakes are still not perfect but that was ok by me. I left town using the bike path which goes from town to town without the traffic of the wine route. Ooooohhh, did I ever sweat. I picked one of the steepest way to start with and it got very hot in there, no wind. I found myself surrounded by rows of grapevines, and hills all around, all of them full of the same grapevines.     I was a bit discouraged to see my lack of progress and how slow it was going when I was looking at my map. Would I be in good enough shape to climb the high passes of the Alps? Would I be able to follow Jean-Francois? He has been riding 2500 km this year. Me? I would say less than 1000. I am not sure as I didn't have a computer when I was training on the mountain bike.  Leaving the campsite someone asked to borrow my air pump, and being from the area, he recommended me some routes to do, especially 'La route des cretes' (the Crest Road). So off I go, passed by Kayserberg which is totally fabulous and start my climb towards the 'col du Bonhomme'(949 m). Bonhomme was posted to be 4 km away from where it started to climb more seriously but that was only the little village. I had to climb more, sweat more, climb again all that in a rather busy truck route, you know the 18 wheels type. I managed ok although I would have preferred something more quiet. All the traffic was very considerate to me and I really appreciate that. I phoned my sister from a phone booth in a rest area and it felt good to tell some of my tales so far. Eventually I made it at the Col du Bonhomme and got into a hotel-restaurant in order to refill my water bottles.    There was a lot of motorcyclists parked there and sipping on a drink on the patio and also a few cyclists, but none had panniers on. I had a lot of eyes staring at me as I was handling the bike, and I was aware of that. I think that people were recognizing the effort I made on my way up here. I didn't hang out very much and soon enough I was on my way to the 'Col de la Schlucht'. (1258m)(What's in a name?)... Climb climb climb, and climb more. It was enjoyable, I was in a forest and the air was cool sometimes a little too cool for my short sleeves. The most irritating was the constant buzz of the motorcycles. There must have been 2 to 300 passing me today. I met this cyclist on a high plateau who told me that most of those motorcyclists were German, and they were coming out here for enjoying the speed in the mountains as they didn't have the right to ride that way at home. Sadly maybe 3 or 4 km before the Col de la Schlucht, there was a motorcyclist down in the ditch, and emergency vehicles on the scene. There was not much movement happening, and not much noise either. I didn't stop, and continues with a somber mood. I was greeted at the junction of the pass with applauds from a couple of tourists watching. I was a little embarrassed by the attention, not being used to that. There was also a lot of bikers in leathers showing me the thumb up in admiration. Cyclists were up there as well, again none having panniers like me and mostly men. I decided to head back down the mountain towards Colmar instead of continuing south on the route des Cretes. I wanted to be in Colmar today so I can head back to Strasbourg the next day, and also I had enough of the hills, the cold and the motorcycles. The way down was... cold, exhilarating, and scenic as approaching the end of the descent I was offered a view of the whole valley. It was fabulous! My average speed picked up from 13 to 17 km/hr and soon I was riding in the 27-28 km/hr range on the flat. Ahhhh! This was  more like me! I must have reached the campsite I aimed for in the suburb of Colmar past 18:30. I purchased a beer that I gulped as I pitched the tent and also a 'Coca Light' for celebrations. My body needed the fluid, the bubbles, the caffeine... I had a wonderful pasta meal with pepperoni and tomato sauce in it and had an apple for dessert, hot chocolate for afterwards. Nights were still cool so a hot drink was welcome.
I visited the old part of Colmar with its narrow streets, churches that are so old that even your great grand-ma wouldn't be THAT old, with its roof that's patterned and with the houses that are all different yet matching with one another and making the whole very very charming. I would have like to visit the church yet didn't feel safe leaving the bike alone. Well ha! I took a chance leaving my bike unlocked in front of the Monoprix a large surface grocery store, and also in front of a woman and her child begging and lots of tourists circulating or hanging out. My bike ended up being just fine, and soon after I was on my way out of town, wanting to get away from all the business and traffic. I decided to head back passing through Ribeauville and then head back north towards Strasbourg by the mountains. Good choice, girl...    From the beginning the way up to Ste-Marie-aux-Mines was enchanting and peaceful, but for when the motorcycles would come by. They weren't as numerous as yesterday and it was more pastural as the previous day as well. Someone asked me on top of the pass if the Tour the France had already started looking at me climbing with all my gear. That was really cute... The col de Ribeauville is high of 742 m and left me in a sweat. Lots of tight switchbacks, but the grades were all do-able and I did it easy. There is this feeling of satisfaction and accomplishment when one reaches the top and start gaining speed from the downhill. The way down was spectacular too looking down the valley. It was so lush, smelling so fresh... I loved it!    The second pass I did today, the Col de Fouchy (603 m) was absolutely fantastic. I was greeted by a bunch of motorcyclists resting on top which made me shy a bit, so I stopped for the time of a picture and started my descent towards Fouchy. A little goat said hi and I replied happily and the twists and turns of the road were magnificent, each showing me a different panorama of the valley and the town down there. I had a lot of fun in there, smiling to myself, screaming 'yahoo' to the world... I had a few km of flat to recover and get some blood back into my legs and up we go again... That pass was just a little one, 350 m but it was tiring and also noisy with the motorcyclists. I wanted a cold drink real bad. It was getting late and my goal was to make it to Strasbourg but looking at the map, realized I would get there past 8 PM so I opted for something easier for a vacationing girl and stopped in Obernai, had a beer, relaxed my muscles and cleaned up the first chain tattoes of the trip. I treated myself with a wonderful dinner of pasta, french bread, french cheese and chocolate coated cookies for dessert. The campsite was very quiet that night beside this neighbor of mine screaming 'Putain de merde!' once of twice (not translatable) and beside the crickets. I noticed sunburns behind my shoulders where I haven't been able to reach when applying sunscreen. I made a mental note to try harder. The sun is wicked in here, and when you spend 6 weeks under the element, the exposed skin needs to be protected... I went to bed pleased with my day, aware that those hills were not the Alps but still were a good training prior to them.   
Prior to arriving to Strasbourg there was a U-pick at a strawberry field and got tempted so I parked the bike and out I went picking my strawberries. It made me happy and made me smile... I picked enough for me and not too much for my panniers and carried on. Then I needed to find a grocery store and fast as it was getting past 11 AM on a Saturday, the stores close at noon and everything would be close on Sunday. Fortunately I found something and stocked up in the essentials then headed towards Strasbourg. I didn't have too much trouble to find the infamous and imposing cathedral. Just aim for the middle of town. Once you get up close, follow the tourists. And if you stand right up front, you break your neck trying to look at the top...    There were pedestrians-only streets with lots of junk for us to buy, post card and usual tourist gadgets. It was quite nice, but too many people for my taste. The cathedral was just fabulous to see from all angles. I circled it by bike and sat down on a low wall to eat lunch. In the 20 min I sat there 2 older men came by to beg some food from me. There were lots or beggars on the streets 'working' and this one woman really disturbed me: All dressed of black like muslims do, head covered, she was kneeling on the pavement with her cheek almost touching to ground and looking up to people passing. Unless people have fun doing this and the money is good I wondered how people got to this point in their lives... I wanted to visit the cathedral but unfortunately it is quite risky to leave the bike on its own when the lone cyclist wants to visit a touristy place like the cathedral was. I got around that hurdle by asking another cyclist to watch my bike as he was standing there waiting for his partner to return, and promised not to be too long... (Thank you to that unknown friend for this). The inside of the cathedral was impressive too with the intricate stainglass, I took a few pictures, hoping they will turn out.   Leaving the cathedral behind I walked and biked aimlessly in the 'Petite France' quarter, managed to lose my very precious Alsace-Lorraine Michelin map where I highlighted all my itinary as I went. I also managed to hit a little girl with my front wheel as she was running without looking in the middle of the street. I felt so bad. I was riding slowly when this family come towards me and the children are running one after another. The little girl didn't see me coming but just at the last minute. I applied the brakes but it was too late. The little girl screamed to death and as I braked suddenly I didn't get a chance to get out of my cleats and was hanging on a metal fence by the sidewalk trying to get off the pedals and attempting to reassure the frightened little girl that everything was ok... She had more fright than hurt, fortunately and I apologized profusely to the parents, shaking in my pants. Fortunately the latter were quite understanding that their daughter didn't look around as she was running and also accepted my appologies. I felt so bad... It got me upset for an hour after the incident.          It was shortly after that incident that I noticed the rear rack was wobbly again and the screw was getting lose again. This time it was the opposite side, on the derailleur side. So as I had a spare screw, I changed it but unfortunately the head was too long and impeded on the speed changing. So I had to put the old screw back on, tightening it to the max and making a mental note to check it every day. In the same token my handle bar bag attachment was giving me some grief as well and spent another 15 minutes trying to make it right. After these events, dirty with profuse chain tattoes on the usual leg and still shaken up, I decided I had enough with big cities and to leave town, and by the same token change countries. I had promised to phone Jean-Francois that day and it just happened that I had lots to say... I got a bit of sympathy and felt a bit better from venting it.  I managed to find my way across the Rhine river where on the other side you find yourself in Germany.     There were old custom borders no longer in use and just a very busy boulevard where people drive quite fast. Kehl is very confusing. Especially when you don't have a close-up map and when you don't have a clue what the indications on the road say and when the biker doesn't have a clue where to go! After taking the wrong turn and tuning in circles for a while in Kehl, I stopped in a gas station and asked for directions but the man there didn't speak anything else than German and attempted reluctantly to show me where to go. Welcome to Germany! I felt sorry I could not communicate and when I asked around if someone spoke English or French it felt like begging... After what seemed to be an eternity trying to find my way out of Kehl, I finally followed my own instincts and carried on a little further on the busy road and found just what I needed, a bike path along the Rhine river that was going North and that would take me where I wanted to go, near Karlsruhe.    The bike path was quiet and very scenic, but the paved road became dirt road which slowed me down and I had to fight a head wind that would become increasingly unpleasant. It must have been 4 PM by that time and I had a lot of distance to cover to reach my destination so I was in a hurry. Eventually I gave up the scenery for a parallel paved road and found indications for a bike path for a city I was aiming for which I took. I was then in farmland, everything was lush and beautiful yet different from France and I was enjoying.    Show links to this Hide links to this      Eventually I found the road #36 that was a bit busier but it would take me directly to Baden Baden and beyond and I took that. Martin, a young cyclist of 25 caught up to me and engaged in a conversation in English. I was glad to have some company. Martin was having a 100 km training tonight and didn't mind to slow down for me and also offered some wind protection so we had a little session of drafting after talking for a while. We talked cycling, traveling, work and else. When it got time to part as he was returning home, I knew where I was going but it was getting late! I was still unsure whether I would be able to beat the darkness.  The campsite I was looking that was on my map didn't exist so some kind young soul at a gas station directed me to another one and still had to turn round and round in order to find it. It was advertised at first as a golf course, so I didn't see it at first. When I made it to the campingplatz it was just about dark, 9 PM and it didn't seem to me that the office was open so I went about looking for a place for me to settle. To my big dismay it looked to me like a big resort, and a lot of mobile homes were established. There was also a lake where people did scuba diving and a golf course. Eventually one older man rescued me and lead me to the office where I could register and play my due. The lady at the office wasn't very kind and couldn't care less about me... I wondered whether it was because I didn't speak German. I gave her 12.5 Euro for my little tent and one extra Euro for a token for 3 minutes of hopefully warm water at the shower. All that took a lot of signing and exchange of French and English and German words that went misunderstood by one party or the other. It would have been funny in any other situation but after 130 km and a rather stressful day, all I wanted was to get the film of sweat and dust off my body, pitch my tent, have dinner and go to bed. Mosquitoes were ravenous here and I had to move continuously to avoid being stung. I ate by 10:30 PM, and gastronomy was my emergency ramen noodles with a carrot and cheese. It was dark and here I was sitting outside trying to take hold of  what I had done today... I was glad to rest my head on the pillow...if pillow it was!
So off I go, north, to reach the begining of the tourist route of the Black Forest. Ettlingen was the doorway and I circled a few times in the city to find its center and also to find the said tourist road. I treated myself with lunch in Ettlingen, sitting under shade and eating a donair. It was interesting again to place that order as there was no other way to be understood but to sign and point with the finger, but the waitress and I managed...I enjoyed sipping my Coke writing post cards. Very quiet town on this Sunday, only across the street there was a small bar and a few people were watching the World Cup playing live and were cheering for whatever team.  After lingering a bit I left for the hills, after asking for my way- which always helps... One word regarding bike paths in Germany. They are numerous, they are generally off the road, generally well signed, and if you know where you are going, there is usually a bike path for you! However I got caught a few times taking a bike path and not ending where I wanted to go. So once or twice I just ignored it and took to road. Well! A few drivers made me know I should have taken the said path. I don't know for sure what they said but in english it would probably sound this way: '@#$#@!%?' !!! The off road  bike path I took from Ettlingen to Pfaffenrot (and probably beyond) was away from the road, up the mountain. I was riding in the forest, quietly, crossing bikers and the odd pedestrian once in a while. It was enjoyable especially in the shade but I got some handle bar bag holder problem again today which forced me to stop and to swear a few times.    I had a little stop at the touristy Bad Herrenalb for a diet Coke and a rest. Soon after I was climbing again- I would say a 500 m hill- hard to guess and I enjoyed it. The downhill afterwards was to die for! Brand new pavement, curvy, and so, so cool! I screamed a few 'yahoo!' just because I was so happy!      On my way through Bad Wildbad I had to pass a tunnel-I don't know if I read the sign right saying that bike were allowed or what, but it was kind of spooky... Of one km long, curvy, I had to ride on a narrow sidewalk, climb down to cross a turn off and climb back onto the other side... I had my red flashing light clipped to my shorts and lived to  tell about it... Another yahoo experience (to be alive that is)...    Eventually I made it to my destination, a little town named Enzklosterle, in a quiet campsite by a river. The camping owner lives here with his demented mom that I met in the lobby.  As usual my shower was delightful...There was only this one couple with their 2 children, and the woman came and say hi as I was cooking, offered me a beer and I accepted with many thanks... I was craving one and as I came rather late nothing was open for me to come to camp with one. That was really nice. She dug her english from far away and we exchange a few laugh and some conversation. That was touching. The young children were curious about me, as I was cooking on this weird little stove and I offered them some cheese sticks. My dinner tonight was a cream of potato with potatoes ,carrots and broccoli added, served with cheese and a crusty bun... Yum yum... Hot chocolate for dessert. I am happy to have time to relax tonight, a contrast with last night.
I woke up with an extremely full bladder and it got me out of the tent in a flash. It was kind of sunny, some clouds and somewhat cool... I wonder if it's colder because of the altitude, because I slept with my fleece and long pants on. Usually I end up too hot dressed like that and take off layer in the middle of the night. Not today. I was hungry. My bags were empty so I packed it all up and went down to the village's bakery to see what they got. I found a wonderful pastry with cheese on it and pieces of ham. Then, for dessert, an apple strudel... Yum yum yum. Now I had to burn it off... The cycling was very pleasant. Passing through forests, open spaces, valleys, villages, it was all very enjoyable, without too much traffic.    Past Freudstadt which to me was uninteresting I started on a busy road and then opted for something quieter. Climb climb climb, ended up in a very quiet little village called Odenwald and I refilled my water bottles in a town fountain. I talked to the cows as we were nose to nose and took a few pictures... By then the cycling got a little tough for my liking. I think I am starting to feel tired from my last days riding.          I wanted to see Titisee and sleep there because I liked the name and because I read in the Lonely Planet that is was a nice place to be in. Well I reached St-Georgen with 90 km on the counter and realized there was at least 50 more to Titisee. And more climbing to do. Just out of St-Georgen I received the first drop of rain, which I refused to believe it was what it was until I started to get seriously wet. I had to stop and access my rear panniers (tough thing to do in the middle of the day) to get my jacket out, the booties, then get the map in and take my courage and wing it to find my way and find a place to camp for the night. The map said there was a youth hostel in Triberg so I asked around with the usual sign language, and eventually I learned that the hostel was way, way up there, up the mountain... ha! In the meantime I was cycling in a delightful backcountry road, where the real people live. Mrs Hen crossed right in front of my bike and Mr Rooster said Cocoricooooo!!! The cows looked at me like I was crazy. The children didn't notice me, too busy playing... I should have taken a picture, but it was raining, I was going downhill and I was wondering if I was going in the right direction. Lots of reasons and I will still be disappointed that I didn't frame this one. In Triberg I took a turn like if I was going to Titisee and started climbing and climbing high and steep. Then I saw the sign for the youth hostel. With the rain being rather heavy and more hills in the future for me towards Titisee I decided to go for the hostel. The grade up that hill must have been 15% maybe more. Unbelievable. For the first time in a long time I had to walk my bike. The hill defeated me... I didn't mind so much but I think I was worried about what would come next. Hey, it was still a work out to push the bike!!! There was a bunch of youth at the hostel, like between 10 and 15 years old. It was clear in my mind that I wanted to camp. The rain had stopped. It was much much quieter outside than in. I found the hostel attendants in the kitchen, trying to cater to all the kids, and asked permission to pitch my tent in the backyard, have a shower and use the bathroom. They agreed, all that for nothing so far. The shower was divine, hot and everything and I had a nice salad with german sausage and couscous dinner. The cherries, meant for dessert were eaten pitching the tent. I had a leisurly evening writing and walking around and taking picture. I phoned my friend Michele for her birthday and tried my father but there was no answer.    Short story before I go to bed... I went to the washroom a last time before retiring in my quarters and in order to save power, the lights are tuning on and turning off automatically. I am not sure if there is a movement detector or what, but... Well here I am all organized on the trone reading my map when... it gets completely dark... Oppps... He he! I guess one has only so many seconds to do their business in the washroom then you are expected to be out. Hope it wasn't too much details... Good night!
Triberg... I slept ok but was woken up by a mother nature's 'son et lumiere' (thunderstorm) and a little bit of rain. I fell asleep after the show, closing my tent and putting the head back on to the pillow. In the morning, the sun was back on and my stomach was empty and growling. I braved out shyness and went to the hostel and ask if it was possible to have breakfast. For 3 Euros I had 2 glasses of juice, I bowl of cereal, 3 buns of medium size, cheese, jam. Yum. What a piglet I am, I ate it all. Went back to my tent, packed it all up, and left with anticipation of the big hill that was awaiting my right off the bat. It ended up going ok, even though I was worried I might have to walk it up. I conquered it and started my cycling day. The air was fresh, the shade was good and the views on top of the hill fabulous... One thing about today was the wild flower fields were just fantastic- yellow, purple and white all over. Once in a while there would be villages and once in a while I would stop for refreshments. Now, I knew this would be a long day. The hostel attendant had recommended me the flatter course and the most direct route that would lead me in Switzerland. But I wanted to see Titisee...  So off I go to Titisee. Riding the last section to reach the town was a bit nerve racking as I seemed to be on a highway with not much shoulder. I had my first glimpse off some snow on the mountains which got me in awe. The lake was pretty, the city quite touristy, and I had a lunch of bread, cherries and coke and after dabbing myself of sun screen I left for my next destination, the Swiss border.    Now and then I had the chance to talk to the cows, the goats and the sheep but not much luck for answers. It must have been mid day when I noticed my camera would no longer take pictures. When I turned the camera on, the zoom would expand to the maximum and an error message would appear on the screen. Now this was a very distressing moment for someone like me who's pictures were very meaningful. This meant no pictures at the swiss border, no pictures of the swiss landscape, no pictures of Zurich. I would think and re-think in my head what to do, as I couldn't go on like this, without camera for the rest of my trip, this was just not possible. In the meantime, I passed at the swiss border at 4 PM I'd say. It was a very small one, just one person attending. He made me park my bike aside while he was checking out my passport. 2 minutes after that he returned it to me stamped and I was free to go. The first thing I noticed of Switzerland was the price of the gas compared with the one in Germany. Well it was only later that I understood that with the money change, it would end up being the same... Still it was way more expensive than in Canada. I was glad I didn't need any... Soon enough I emerged up a hill with commanding views of the North of Switzerland... Long plains full of agriculture and viniculture and once in a while, here and there I could see one village with its typical red roof houses and the inevitable church. Still every village had its fountain available for everyone to fill out their water bottles. It had been great for me and sometimes I would stop and refill my bottles, and also wet my bandana and wash my face with it and then place it on my head to cool off... Past the border I didn't want to look at my mini computer as I knew I was beyond 100 km and I knew I had quite a bit to go before Zurich. I was trying to look at the scenery, singing , and thinking 'Zurich'. The little village of Reineau was totally charming. In the middle of a meandering of the Rhine river that I met again after crossing from Strasbourg to Kehl, I had to cross in a beautiful covered bridge and head back up the hill in a quaint little village. It was a popular place for cyclists and I met plenty including one that rode with me for a whileand enquired about my trip. It was in Flaash that I got lost, or maybe the map lost me. There was no indications for the direction I wanted so I was forced to do a detour which I was not so pleased about as I was already at 130 km and not in Zurich yet (ok I had a peek at the computer). Oh well. I managed I guess. Did the detour. Followed the highway without being on it, stopped in Embrach for groceries- they happened to close so I was lucky I got in. I gulped my ice tea bottle like there was no more drinking for 3 days and swallowd all at once a soft cookie filled with apple in the middle. Yum. If I was going the distance today, might as well keep the stomach happy uh? Soon after that I reached Kloten where I would meet Jean-Francois the next day and the sight of it made me really happy almost emotional. I didn't have time to get emotional as I had to remain focused and alert in the traffic to make it alive to the campsite. In Zurich I had to ask many people for directions and finally I was directed to the train station for tourist info regarding my campsite. I thanked the guy who helped me at the visitor center and who brought me the good news that the camping was less than 10 km away and not too difficult to find, then I got other much needed information like where was the nearest internet caf, camera shop and then carried on. Negociating the downtown core in any city is always tricky, but after 160 km on a loaded bike, well... what can I say...I had to fight for my space in between scooters, pedestrians, cars, trucks and trams. I was honked at once for not knowing where to go. Ooops. Then made my way around Limmat Quay and looked at the tremendous views I had across the canal. Beautiful city. I am impressed. I reached the camping by 9, maybe later, after 8h30 on the bike and 172.1 km, my longest distance ever on a bike in one day, with or without load. I was tired but not exhausted.. I pitched my tent by Zurichsee, the lake, and had a delightful but expensive (4 Francs for 6 minutes) shower and had some of my cuisine with was quite yummy. Mind you dinner at 10:30 PM is always good after 172 km... So, this is my story... Sticking to it!
So... First things first, eating. I had a left over of bread and a single sample of Nutella which I really liked. A banana. I took a detour after the bathroom run to buy some yogurt and orange juice. Then I was shown the best place for specialists to have a look at my camera and the lady had a look at it and announced that it was dead. There was no way I could go the rest of my trip without a camera so I looked into replacements and found this second hand Minolta, compact with a zoom. It looked ok with an acceptable price. Done deal. Then I headed to the laundromat. At 5.5 Swiss Francs for a wash and 3.8 Swiss Francs for a drying, you better make sure your clothes is well beyond dirty when you wash. (That was close to 10$ Can. for the whole thing). It was 11:30 when I was out of there and I was wanting to do some internet work but my stomach started making wahing machine noises to make sure I knew it was hungry... "Feed me, feed me!!!" I found some pizza from a sidewalk vendor and I ate it like there was no tomorrow and it tasted just wonderful, greasy and cheesy and all..        Back to my campsite I had a little bit of time to sit down and enjoy the scenery so I did just that and updated my journal, watched the duck doing their duck things and remembered I had some wine left in my pack and also some left over Gouda so I pretended to be a queen on holidays and had a little wine and cheese as I sat there...  I packed it all up at 3 PM and realized that I must have had a hole in my inflatable mattress. It was flat this morning and this afternoon too when I used it as a chair... I guess that if I won't get flat tires, might as well get some flat mattress... That said, I was on the road again, with all my gear, towards Zurich and then Kloten by the airport where I would meet Jean-Francois. On my way there I stopped at the train station to pick up my mail at the internet caf. Still can't edit my text at www.crazyguyonabike.com  (I would later learn it was a cookie problem)(Sorry Neil). Jean-Francois e-mailed me some funny things that made me laugh. There was a small food market going on at the train station, so I bought some nectarines and some cherries and left for Kloten. Meeting Jean-Francois was fun. I was jolted by the ride in (I got lost) and excited to be there and to finally see him in person. He was still in bed as the plane landed in the morning and he was jet lagged but got up and gave me a hand with my packs and examined my bike like a surgeon would when opening a belly trying to find the source of bleeding. My bike passed the test thankfully. We had a good dinner at the hotel's restaurant, some swiss specialty, rostis potatoes, veal in a mushroom sauce, beer. Yum.  Nice finishing touch to a nice day.   
Breakfast was included in the room's price so we went downstairs and were offered a plate of breads and cold cuts and cheese coffee and orange juice. That was worth 18 Swiss Francs, or 18 Canadian dollars. So much for our logger's breakfasts in Canada uh? It is amazing how expensive things are over here. Our supper last night ended up being 110 Swiss Francs, for a very ordinary dinner.  Soon enough we were on the road negociating the morning traffic to make it to Zurich. We had a picture of us taken in front of the hotel marking the start of our trip together.     We had a few things to do in Zurich and then we finally headed out of town, leaving behind the city, the traffic and hustle and bustle. After an hour and a half of cycling my stomach was screaming for food, remnants of my very long day of 172 km.  I remembered being happy of being there, looking around in the fields, the cows, the towns in the horizon, the forests...      A little incident happened when we had to cross a busy road as the bike path was changing side of the road. At first I hit Jean-Francois on his left rear pannier as I didn't think he would stop in the middle of the road and then I heard him give me the ok to cross with a 'go' but it happened to be a 'no!'. That shook him up quite a bit I think. It was a fast day today with good descents and good, fast, flat sections. We made it to Luzern in the middle of the afternoon and we settled for lunch on the side of the lake with a tremendous view over the mountains.           Jean-Francois was hit by a bird's dropping right on the neckline of his white t-shirt. I couldn't stop laughing. After lunch I went investigating for bathrooms when I cam across an aviary, with a very nice citron-crested cockatoo (kind of parrot). It took a while to convince Jean-Francois to come over and see the little surprise I had for him (the bird) but when he saw he found it fun to play with the little beast. The parrot was very interactive, mimicking my laugh or bobbing the head after I did. The people sitting behind must have had a show of us trying to entertain the parrot. That was so cool! I had a belly workout from laughing...    We left Luzern for our campsite which was probably 20 km down the road, in Sarnen.    It got increasingly cloudy and Jean-Francois was getting quite tired with the jet-lag. We got to pitch our tent with the beginning of the thunderstorm and we had dinner under an overhang, sitting on my air mattress. It was with reluctance that we had to face the rain to cover the 500 m to our tents. Arrrgh... Rain is not in my plans so when it comes.... Yuk! Son et lumiere was good though.
   The first stage of today was to get to the foot of Brunigpass and to climb it. It elevates at 1002 meters and is climbed in 2 steps, with a nice flat section with a lake. The views were fabulous.       The climbing, well it had to be done. The route was turning and turning, sort of narrow and the trucks were passing all right. Most were very good. I stopped a few times to take pictures and to take my breath. Jean-Francois was ahead, standing on the bike all the way and climbing steadily. I was trying to follow, but in the same time if I saw something nice to frame I would stop and take a picture. Eventually we reached the pass, took a traditional picture and let ourselves go down.    The pavement was drying, passing through the forests and sometimes we had tremendous views of the surroundings, it was awesome... We ended up having to make a 10 km detour because of rock fall and that happened to be good as it allowed us to see war planes at exercise and landing in the fields, a hidden military base I guess. The planes passed ahead of us a few time and rather low, like in the movies. Eventually we made it through Brienz and started to go along Brienzersee. It was goergious at it was just a begining!!!  We had a stop on a wharf and I splurged in some very expensive Pepsi, and a snack for energy and carried on.    The goal was to reach Interlaken, do the groceries and have a lunch there. I was glad to reach it as I needed energy... We were very fortunate to have good weather and to be able to dry our tent while we ate. On the menu: a small chicken with Dijon mustard and bread... Yum. It was fairly late when we left Interlaken and still had to cover 40 km or so for Bern, our destination. Along Thunersee (or Thun lake) we had fabulous views over the lake, the mountains (I had to imagine them or else have a look at them on post cards as they were hidden behind the clouds) and the little villages full of charms with really nice Swiss chalets with big overhangs and flower boxes at each windows. We rose once at 100 m above the lake level and had a view over Interlaken on one side and Thun at the other end of the lake.      We also passed by a couple of castles that I really would have liked to visit but we were passed the visiting hours and we were in a bind with time, we had a deadline to observe and we were expected at my aunt's place tomorrow. It's always like that with me isn't it, always rushing into things? So we visited the washrooms in Thun and that was just about it. The city looked pretty. Then we headed towards Bern passing by the country side. The road we picked was very hilly. It was only when we got on top of a big hill and looking at the valley that we realized that the road we wanted was the flat one at the bottom...    We made it to the campsite after 8:30 PM, after 115 km sun trying to show up before setting. There was a party going on in the neighborhood and partyers wanted to share their music selection with everybody at a kilometer around, typical Friday night. It was kind of cold that night. The showers were a bit cold too, to my disappointment. I will always repeat it, there is nothing like a warm shower after a long day cycling... We had a free use of an outdoor mini kitchen and we splurged in a pasta dinner at 10:30 PM. Called it a night after that.   
Then we reached Fribourg and stop in the old town for lunch in a tea room. Jean-Francois bought a can of ravioli that he opened and ate like is (cold) yerk... I had some Pringles, a ham croissant that was so-so and a couple of desserts. A Coke. A cup of tea to warm up from the Coke.It was when we got out that the rain started. Awwww... Rain, rain, always the rain...        In Payerne we stopped in a large surface to stock up in groceries. Everything is closed on Sunday so we needed a few things for tomorrow. In the meantime Jean-Francois was checking the bikes and having coffee. The coffee got him going real good on the read as he left like a bullet on an uphill. Soon came Estavayer-le-lac, a fortified medieval city with a lot of character. We went in, thumbling on the cobblestone until the church, took a few picture and left in the direction of Cheyres, little village where my aunt lives with her family. I would have liked to visit around as it was totally charming and the map was indicating a castle there but we didn't see any signs for it and we were expected so we left...    We had to do a little climbing to reach the village which left me with a film of sweat within my rain jacket. The rain was at that time mostly mist and totally inoffensive but still had to cover myself for warmth. My aunt and uncle were out singing for a wedding and we were greeted by my cousin Marie, who is 15.  We were kind of shy with one another because I haven't seen her in quite a while and we don't know each other well. She had become a real teenager, hating school and putting on make up! That evening we were treated like royalty! We had a fabulous dinner of Raclette, Cheyres' wine, boiled potatoes, pickles, little onions, bread. Yum! After dinner Jean-Francois tried his luck with a couple of games of ping pong with my uncle Claude, to no avail. My aunt Brigitte and I went visitting the vineyards and went picking cherries. We must have picked 6 or 7 pounds . We also had a contest of cherry pit spitting and had a good laugh about it.    A little internet session followed and also more cherry splurging (my uncle says that we will be very "regular"). It was good to have a roof over us as it rained overnight...
We were treated to a loggers breakfast this morning. Eggs, bacon, cereals, yogurt, cheese, cherries, maple syrup, coffee, orange juice, you name it. Yummy. We were given 6 packs of swiss chocolate for the road...Thank you Brigitte and Claude! We said good bye, 3 cheek kisses for each my aunt, uncle and niece as the Swiss tradition wants it.      My uncle Claude was to accompany us by bike for a little while. He found our lifestyle quite interesting and healthy and he was impressed with my level of fitness. Passing on a small bike path in the midst of fields of wheat, sugar beet and other cultures, my uncle was explaining what plant was what and that was fun.    Kissing goodbye my uncle at an intersection, and after a fair amount of climbing we stopped in a deserted little village looking for our route and I found the cutest baby goats in a goat nursery by the road. They were adorable. I wanted to get the camera out and in the time of 2 seconds I dropped it on the pavement which messed the electronics up real good. I wanted to cry. This was the second time this trip. This was the second time this trip that my camera broke, and now what?    Eventually we made it to Lausanne, uneventfully beside me ruminating my camera loss. We reached the cathedral that is up a hill and overlooks the city and le Lac Leman and the mountains that should be across the lake but were not. Instead there were big black clouds and they spreaded all the way towards Montreux, just where we were going. We ate half of the 5 pounds of yummy cherries we were given in Cheyres and had a bit of a snack. I took on the opportunity to visit the cathedral. I managed to make the camera work by playing around with the battery door to turn the camera on and off but the zoom was dead. Meawhile Jean-Francois was being entertained by the post card sale lady and her dog.        Leaving the cathedral we went all the way down to Ouchy with its promenade on the lake passing the Olympic Museum and also a castle. It was a few kilometers later that tragedy almost happened as a car advanced on the road trying to turn left on our road and didn't see us cyclists. Jean-Francois and I screamed real loud to the point of being scared of my own voice. If we had not warned the driver of our presence we would have been just a pack of broken bones and squashed cherries. It left me shaken for a little while after that. We carried on with tremendous views of the surroundings including luxurious mansions, vineyards from the edge of the water to high up in the mountains, and on the other side of the lake stunning  mountains announcing for us the end of rolling hills and really soon some serious climbing.    It must have been around Vevey that the sky fell on us. All of a sudden. We had some warnings but I thought the clouds could go away before we made it to Montreux. Well we were out of luck. Mother Nature had an urge and we were to get what we got! We sought refuge under an overhang for the worse of the shower and left when it eased up. Montreux seemed quite nice to me. There were a couple of castles that I would have liked to visit but being all wet, and with little time to spare to make it to the next campsite, there was no way... I was disappointed that I couldn't stop and appreciate the places I was passing by. Stopping in Montreux for energy and pee break, I found a good old Mc Donald for using the washrooms. In a nick of time we were back on the road, soon leaving the Lac Leman behind, and the road got kind of boring, I was wet and probably tired too. I was a bit disappointed not to see the mountains that seemed to elevate quite high as they also seem to get closer and tighter around the road we were taking. I called up on an energy break past St Maurice as I learned in past situations that when I get low in sugar, I get cranky and down and everything gets black. We leaned the bike over a house that was by the sidewalk, ate a couple of nectarines and cherries. Jean-Francois was admiring a cat through a window when we heard a suspicious noise coming off his bike. A spoke broke just like that, on the rear wheel. We had to think what to do. We decided to head to the camping we had just past, that really didn't look like the greatest but oh well. Indeed entering it really looked spooky with its old abandoned campers and mobile homes with blue tarps on them. It fortunately got better further down, and it had to do. We met some cyclists that were camping too but busy with the camping chores, and getting cold we kept to ourselves. The shower really warmed my heart and my feet and I made some soup while Jean-Francois fixed his rear wheel. Fortunately while the rain fell we were sheltered in between 2 rows of sinks with lots of room to do stuff like... Sorting out equipment, drying stuff etc... While Jean-Francois had a shower I got busy at making my couscous dinner, 2 more spokes popped on his rear wheel. A little disconcerting. We had dinner and went to bed, leaving the spoke job for the morning.     
Soon after straddling the bike again, we were on the way up. The Col de La Forclaz (pronounce Fore-Claw) stands at 1527 m. Martigny is at 476 m. 13 km of climbing, not much rest if none in between. We took a break at the first look out offering tremendous view over the mountains and the valley that lead to Italy, following the Rhone river.     Jean-Francois later told me he broke another spoke just before arriving at the lookout. For some reason he didn't tell me. I was climbing at 7 or 8 km an hour. A little farther down the road, I called upon another stop to catch up my breath and had a little pee under a bridge. The views were still awesome, leaving behind vineyards and entering a more forested environment, gradually getting alpine. The mountains were awesome all around. Eventually we started some switchbacks and noticed that the voice was carrying quite far... At least some motorcyclists were thinking so!!! We were slowly going uphill and ahead we heard people trying their voice (Heyyyyyy Hooooooo!) and Jean-Francois answered back to much of their surprise as they couldn't see us yet! We had a good laugh about it in between being out of breath from the climbing. It felt like an achievement when finally there was nothing more to climb and I saw the famous sign announcing we were at the top of the pass. I was proud of myself. We were offered breathtaking views of the snow capped peaks around. We bought some post cards, had a bite to eat, dressed up and went down the hill. It was down that hill that we crossed the French border, not a big deal anymore in the European community as nobody was watching the border or asked us to stop. It was a deal for me, another step into my trip.      The Col des Montets wasn't as impressive but still stands at 1461 m. Once we made it to the top we said: 'That's it?'...     We clicked the camera for souvenirs and headed downhill all the way to Argentiere which is a nice little village catering to the tourists and also the hikers, skiers and climbers. I would have liked to stop but then we were heading to Chamonix for a meal stop and needed a grocery store before everything closed for the day. We couldn't verify that Mont-Blanc was indeed right there, as it was hidden behind thick clouds. The only clue we had that something real big was there was this huge overhanging glacier visible. I was disappointed not to be able to see the infamous mountain. I stopped in a photo shop and changed my Swiss Francs and lost a lot of money on the deal. Then went for groceries while Jean-Francois was checking over the bikes, looking for things for our dinner and also a good snack to eat on the spot as we still had a fair distance to cover before our stop for the day.  Fortunately the way to Sallanches was all downhill, and enjoyable, other than looking for our way trying to bypass the highway. We lost some times around Les Houches as Jean-Francois was trying to remember where to take the overpass and reach the quiet road on the other side of the highway. We asked around and decided to retreat and engage on the highway hoping for safe shoulder and light traffic. I felt fairly comfortable on the said highway,being used to heavily passed roads. Jean-Francois was stressed out. At times we had no shoulder at all and cars were fast, but respectful.  It was a relief to exit and get onto the quiet road, in a forested area. That last section was very enjoyable to me winding down the hill with the views over the surrounding mountains and the valley, losing lots of altitude to finally make it down to the valley in Sallanches. Jean-Francois had it the hard way with yet another spoke to fix, trying to be gentle with his out-of-true wheel and hoping to avoid breaking more spokes. The first camping found in Sallanches we took and it ended up being a really good deal. Jokingly I asked the owner who was registering us that we wanted a pizza and beer with the deal and he said he would see what he could do for us. But first he led us to our lot and opened a little cabin for us for the price of the campsite!!! Toilet, 2 rooms, kitchen, fridge, everything! There was also a table and chairs on the patio and even a clothesline to dry our stuff. I was impressed with the generosity and I think that Jean-Francois was too. Not only that but our host came back with 4 beers that he offered us. I gave him some Euros, overwhelmed by now...       Being in the cabin made our life easier that night with a nice shower, drying everything that was wet, fixing the spoke, and cooking dinner, real gastronomy here... a very yummy pork and cashews sweet and sour stir-fry over a bed of rice. Yummy. Chocolate for dessert. We slept like babies that night in the bunk room. 
We had planned a small day today, thought we'd do one pass, the Col des Saisies and stop in Beaufort. We would change our mind later that morning to a fuller day, adding another Col and take a rest day in Bourg St-Maurice which would place us in a better position for the days to come to attack the next mountains.  We started climbing right at the exit of Sallanches and was there ever lots of traffic! There was some construction with alternate circulation and flag men at both ends. Jean-Francois decided to go ahead of the line up of cars waiting to have the right of way. And seeing no cars coming in the opposite direction decided to go ahead and I followed. Eventually the line-up of cars and dirt trucks caught up with us, and as the road was very narrow with no shoulder, this truck got impatient with me as I was taking my space and he couldn't go and as it was uphill I wasn't very fast and I knew it. I had nowhere to go so I ignored the trucker and kept on pedaling and sweating profusely like I usually do on an uphill. Jean-Francois was ahead as he always is uphill and I was working hard to catch up with him. When it got a little wider the dirt truck passed and  forced me out of the road, that or passing under his rear wheel. I ended up falling in lose dirt. That incident really scared me with the result that I got upset at Jean-Francois for being so much in a hurry. I was shaken for a while trying not to cry in the next few km of pedaling. I found that Jean-Francois didn't want to stop anywhere and the area was beautiful and I felt like I couldn't stop and take pictures because I would be waited for. The road continued to be busy and I was kind of nervous so I called on a break at the next village.      Food takes care of a lot of things... It calms people down, refills the body with much needed reserves and prevents low blood sugar which can make people cranky... Well it helped in my case and in case of doubt, I try to remember to have a bite... So we left for our much longer than planned day and got thankful that we had a good 20 km slightly downhill. It helped me refocus and get my muscles working again. Further down the road we turned off to a 2.5 km climb to our lunch spot at Notre-Dame de Bellecombe, our last rest stop before les Saisies. I had a go at my first Turkish toilet, the kind of 'toilet that has only a hole on the ground and 2 footprints just for that, the feet. The instructions are not posted anywhere but you get it real fast when you gotta go. You get your pants down and you squat. If you are not aiming very well like some women like me do when they are not used with the system you get your legs splashed... and when you flush the toilet make sure that you get out of there real fast because water will come sometime as close to the door to wash everything you may have splashed while doing your business... A very cultural experience... I was quite grossed out.    The col des Saisies was quite a climb but doable. We just had to pace ourselves. We passed through a few little villages and pastures with cows and then some skiing oriented villages. Finally we were on top, and cold with the wind.    All dressed up we didn't lose time and aimed at Beaufort. Beautiful but cold descent, I just had a kick! There was this 18 wheelers that followed us as we were doing 40 or 45 for a while and they got very patient with us until it was safe to pull out in a hairpin turn. Thanks guys...  In Beaufort we took a quick break in front of the public washroom which I refused to get in fear of some the mighty squat style again. So instead I went for groceries and with dinner in mind as we expected to get in town fairly late. The Cormet de Roseland was a bigger challenge, standing at 1968 m (we left Beaufort at 743 m). We had 20 km of tough climbing before the summit with  endless switchbacks, narrow roads and commanding views over the surroundings.     I was huffing and puffing, but also could appreciate the beauty around me, talking moo to the cows and just being in awe of being where I was. Eventually and thankfully we made it at a first pass called Col du Meraillet, and that was right in front of an artificial lake and let us see what was ahead , what was left to climb. It was awesome, we could see some lunar like geography, some grassy steep hills where likely the sheep come but all that in a very quiet peaceful high altitude environment. We had another pause there before attacking the last 8 km before reaching the top.      We got applauded by some hikers watching us while resting which somewhat gave me goose bumps and a little farther down stopped at the sign saying Cormet de Roseland. It was windy and cold and it didn't take long for me to dress up as I felt my finger get cold already from the wind, the sudden stop and sweaty body of mine. Raynaud syndrome sufferers will understand me... We took pictures of each other and then left as it was getting fairly late, maybe getting closer to 7:30 PM. The first little stretch wasn't that steep but I was going slowly, because I had the impression of cycling into a cliff and falling over. Eventually I could see where we were to go and every turn a new vista would surprise my eyes and even though I was frozen to the bones I was loving what I saw... I wish I had taken more pictures but my fingers were like ice blocks...        Jean-Francois broke yet another spoke on the downhill so his ride down was tampered by a rear wheel that was so out of true that when you looked ar it you thought it would get off the bike. It took us an hour to go down the hill, with the twists and turns of the road until we finally reached  Bourg St-Maurice. It must have been 8h30 PM. Another late night. Finding a campsite took us a little while as it wasn't indicated the usual manner on the signs. But we found and pitched the tents at dark. Had a lovely shower in a top notch facility and must have eaten cheese fondue by 10:30 PM...That was good... Another day well spent...
So we walk down, me reluctantly as I thought it would take us like 45 minutes to get there by foot and I would have taken the bike but Jean-Francois had for rule not to use the bike on a day off. We started at the post office, I sent some used maps to my sister for me to pick up on my way home when I'd come back to Paris and I also purchased a phone card and an internet card as some post offices have internet stations. Jean-Francois started with his e-mail and I went on the lookout for a Michelin Alsace map which I have lost in Strasbourg and I wanted it for souvenir of my route.     I also stopped at the photo shop to get one of my rolls finished just to see if I was doing a good job at taking pictures with my new and broken camera. I came back for a little internet session but was disappointed with the connection and Netscape which I am not too familiar with. I didn't do too much. The French people are not so keen with internet cafes!!!  After that, getting close to noon I was past starving and we were getting desperate to find something to eat before everything closed. We audited several places as the surrounding business were putting the key to the door and settled for the bakery and had some pizza, chocolate bread and other delicacies. We ate all that across at a caf-bar, being smoked in by the people beside us. We met some sport-cyclists that we coming from the Cormet de Roseland and we had a little chat about the lovely region they were living in. Coming back toward the campground we parted as Jean-Francois was ready for the bike clean-up and I stopped for grocery shopping in one of the 2 large surface grocery store we encountered on our way. Looking out for iced tea I had the worst bowel cramps ever- and looking real desperately for toilet. Sweating profusely I enquired at the cashier who fortunately directed me to one. I had a bad time- will spare you the details...  It was relief to reach my headquarters and another bathroom, had a nice shower, worked on laundry which was still expensive and laid low all afternoon, writing in my journal, sipping on coke, fighting stomach cramps, and keeping company to Jean-Francois who was doing spring clean-up with all his gear and the bikes. Another spoke repaired on his bike too!    Coming on to 6 PM we left for town for dinner as I was relieved from cooking that night. Jean-Francois had stopped his choice on a nice restaurant, and we made it there for 7 PM after errands and it was still too early for the kitchen... So we settles for 'apperitifs' (Coke for me, beer for him). We treated ourselves to a multi-course dinner with cheese plate before dessert and a Ventoux demi-litre (red wine). It was totally yummy, having ribs for main course.  We headed 'home' by 10 PM full, sort of drunk and tired...   
The climb to Val d'Isere was a steady one, no flat section, from Bourg St-Maurice... At first we passed through little villages but then we were in the wild and increasingly with open views or the mountains around, some hanging glaciers, a valley down low, and quiet tranquility... when the motorcycles were not around... There was construction at a couple of spots explaining the service trucks traffic and once the traffic was being stopped. At first we were told there would be a 15 minutes wait but fortunately after 5 minutes we were allowed to go.      Getting closer to Val d'Isere there were tunnels and avalanche guards to pass, some scarier than others, some oozing with water, other very dark and curvy. That one I had a semi passing me at the same time. I was glad to have my dear clip on red flashing light and we both managed. Traffic is very respectful of us cyclists. It is refreshing to see. By the time we made it to town, in the middle of the afternoon, everything was closed and the city totally deserted. How disconcerting I was looking for yet more food and a cartridge of gas for my stove. No luck. We ate on a bench in front of the bus station and info center that was also closed and I fell asleep afterwards while Jean-Francois fixed yet another broken spoke. He also had time to talk to his sister on the phone before I wake up in a daze and wonder how much time had lapsed... After just about 2 hours break and a stop at the local caf for caffeine we were on our way for the most scenic mountain of the trip I'd say but there was a few that are running up very closely behind, and it is le col de l'Iseran.  The approach to the bottom was easy and scenic climbing up a valley, and the view of the surrounding peaked almost broke my neck. What a spectacle!!!    I wanted to take pictures everywhere! I stopped a couple of time and as Jean-Francois doesn't like to stop when climbing, he left me in the dust, and that was fine by me, I was to freeze the scenery on film, and he could always wait for me...  Soon enough I could not even see him on a higher hairpin and I was all alone, with the constant buzz of the motorcycles, most of them at full speed, some of them careless and reckless.     The climb was tough but rewarding. The snow line appeared, and sometimes the snow banks were higher than me. Apparently they had just officially opened the col to the traffic a few days before we were there. It was very impressive to be there.  Jean-Francois had been waiting for 11 minutes (yeah, he timed it) before I made it on top. He was being entertained by 2 older ladies that were chatty to a fault and congratulated us profusely while we were dressing up and taking a bite before the descent. After a victory picture it was downhill time, which was breathtaking and just fabulous...              Down the valley we encountered some cow traffic as they were returning home after a long day spent chewing grass in the fields. This was another highlight after the col itself as they came toward us in a hurry, wanting to be back home... It was exciting, but also scary to me city girl as some of those big beasts had horns!!!  By that time I was very tired and every little elevation gain felt like a mountain. It was getting late and we were racing for the closing of the store to get some provisions. Fortunately it was all downhill, and I was good at that.  In Lancelebourg we found a few grocery items and some gaz cartridges and we also found out there was a camping in town so we decided to make an early stop here. Beautifully located there was a mountain across the camping offering a spectacular view and the little torrent muffled the noise of the circulation. Of course the other campers looked at us like we were aliens, as to them, holidays meant settling with their trailer, get the patio furniture out and sit there for 2 weeks...   
The cycling was slow for Jean-Francois that morning even though the first 15 km was downhill. Being heavier in gear and also more aerodynamic, I had the advantage downhill. Eventually we made it to St-Michel de Maurienne where we looked for washrooms and found some, Turkish style. They were gross from the outside. I passed. Jean-Francois braved it and the look on his face was precious when he came out of there....  It's at St-Michel de Maurienne that the climb to the Col du Telegraphe and Galibier starts, right after the main traffic light where 4 sports cyclists were standing, one fixing a wheel. That is exactly where, trying to down shift to smaller gear, got my chain off not once but twice! How upsettingand embarrassing. Anyways we got off and started climbing the infamous Col du Telegraphe. It was hot, and a long tough ascent. We were trying to seek refuge in the shade on either side of the road while cycling, most of the time to no avail. Jean-Francois took the lead for a while then I joined him for the end and we summitted together for the time of a drink and a picture. We had planned to go down to Valloire, an alpine style village where we'd have lunch and then attack Galibier, a very respected pass all around the world by the cycling community.      We had lunch in front of a church of Valloire. I was craving Coke, (let alone Pepsi) but nothing was open at this time of day, as usual. It is so frustrating to be in a country where the quality of life of the workers prevails over the comfort of the consumers and tourists... Then after a long lunch, and half an hour of looking around we found that one bar that was open and the so long craved Coke and coffee for monsieur. The climb to Galibier started by 4 PM. At first there was a long steady climb, all do-able. Lovely sceneries of the surrounding mountains, then a not so noticeable aproach to the real climb. We stopped before the hairpins at 'Plan Lachat' (1961m) for a little break before the heavy duty climb, leaning the bike against an abandoned house with lots of signs on the windows saying 'maison piegee' on it (tricked house is my best translation). Following was a steep ascent in switchback, unforgivable, unforgettable. But there was stunning views to keep me distracted, the water to drink, the mind to trick, the breathing to pace. All of that made me climb to the summit.I must admit that the last 2 km were really tough with its steeper ascent and endless turns that prevented you to see where was the end...          We met this one sport cyclist on top that looked quite a bit in shape and was gathering paper journal from car tourists to put under his jersey to keep warm for the descent. It was after talking to him a little longer that he admitted that he hitchhiked and got a ride in the last 10 km because it was too tough for him. He was waiting for his buddy that was coming without cheating so they could go down together. We had a summit picture, ate some food, chocolate, fruits, etc..., dressed up for the descent and left. The way down was awesome. I saw a 'Go Lance' writing on the pavement in reference to Lance Armstrong which was really cool. There was lots of writings like that up the popular passes as those were races pathways.         The junction to the Col de Lautaret came and as there was a caf-bar I went in to refill my now empty water bottles and had a long long descent to Chantemerle where we stopped for the night. We found the camping right at the entrance of the city which was handy, and set up camp almost at dusk. The clouds were threatening and we could hear thunder which fortunately never came out way with the dark clouds. As we didn't have food in the panniers for dinner we treated ourselves in a dinner at the campground's restaurant and had a lovely salad and pizza... Yummy...  It didn't take long before I fell asleep that night... 
We started climbing in town for our first col of the day, col d'Izoard. As the heat was  a factor, at the first fountain we stopped to refresh our water bottles and met up with 2 Italian cyclists that greeted us with a 'Bonjourno'  That surprised me and I could only mumble a greeting in French.  The climb was tough and it took 2.5 hours to summit. Lots of people on top including motorcyclists, sport cyclists and tourists. We are lots and noticed the bag of chips I purchased in Briancon all puffed up ready to explode due to the high altitude.        The downhill was awesome once again but I got really cramped hands due to the breaking I had to do. We then had a treat, cycling along the 'Combo de Querras', a canyon with a fairly flat, windy road with carved tunnels with ceilings that could barely accommodate an 18 wheeler . Jean-Francois had a couple of close calls in tunnels because of people in a hurry. By that time my energy was running low and I was getting cranky. Lunch had to happen     Soon after we were in Guillestre and we borrowed a camping ground to have lunch, and use the plumbing system. Another pass was to come, the Col de Vars. I had another try at the Turkish style toilet, and it was very unsuccessful as I splashed my legs while squatting (Can't I aim???). That was our only opportunity to have bathrooms  for a while, and there was no trees around and nowhere to hide.  Guillestre was like an oven I thought as we left for our next ascent. The climb was slow and hot. Did I say hot? I took the time to wet my bandanna at the campsite and to put it on my head as it was cooling but it didn't cool me for long  I was very tired at the summit as we made it again close to 8PM.      The descent was remarkable for a long 300 or 400 m tunnel that was so dark that we couldn't see a thing, even the holes on the pavement. That one was very spooky. Fortunately there was no traffic. The campsite showed up by 9 PM. Dinner was made and ready by 10:45 PM. Chorizo and rice and corn. A white and caramel cat came to keep us company and to lick the plates scented with yummy sausage. Bed by 11:45 with Jean-Francois's promise he would do the dishes first thing in the morning  
   After some more downhill we made it at the junction and turned to climb 'the highest road of Europe.'  Le Col de La Bonette peaks at 2802 m. It is steady climbing from bottom to top. Being a Sunday, motorcycles were out more than ever and we almost witnessed an accident when a motorcyclist attempted to pass us at full speed in a curve and never saw the incoming motorcyclist. They touched slightly without any impact on either of them or us but it was scary. I told Jean-Francois I was here as a cyclotourist and not a nurse.    In the meantime, we kept climbing. There was some some advertising for 'Halte 2000' all along, which was a restaurant-bar at the altitude of 2000 m and would be our midway point, very conveniently and strategically located for a cold bottle of Coke. I was sweating profusely, drinking water like crazy and focused on that bottle of Coke as the reward for all the work. However Halte 2000 never produced. They got out of business I suppose. That almost crushed me. Fortunately there were lots of streams to refresh our water, even though I had some doubts about the safety of drinking it without any treatment. I didn't care that much as the cold water was refreshing on such a hot day. We carried on winding with spectacular views of mountains, rocks, grass and patches of snow. The higher we got the more we could see the black clouds that were threatening on the other side of the mountains, while it kept being sunny on our side. It was when we heard the thunder that we decided it would be wise to seek refuge before the summit. We found some military buildings used in the second world war, but they were all closed and forbidden to the public but a little higher up there was an abandoned house with open windows and door and we waited there for a while, maybe half an hour. Jean-Francois was keen to go as soon as possible and we seemed to disagree as of what to do next. I wanted to wait and let the storm pass by so we could go down on the other side safely. (Breaking on a wet pavement or raining weather is trivial, and more so down like 2000 m)    Eventually we left and climbed to the junction. At this area, tourists and motorcyclists were gathering, looking around. We were still not there. We had to  climb some more, however it was impossible to pass for cars and some motorcycles as there was a snow bank on the road. Once that bypassed, under the disbelief of the crowd we were back on the saddle to reach our objective, the real Col de La Bonette.  There was a rock slide making the last kilometer and a bit quite difficult with the 13-14% incline. That was tough.     I was counting my pedal strokes, and when I reached a count of 20 to 30 I would get my feet off the cleats, get my breathing  under control, get a sip of water and then do it all over again. Around the corner there was an italian family walking down the hill who applauded my efforts and cheering 'Brava! Brava!'. That made me a bit emotional. Eventually I made it to the highest of the road when nothing else was to be climbed, and met up with Jean-Francois who had made conversation with 2 motorcyclists.     We spent time conversing, maybe too long as we were watching the thick clouds on the horizon. We had a bite to eat, took pictures, dressed up for the descent and then left, cautious with some fallen rocks on the pavement at first then the narrow road that we had to share with the rest of the traffic. There were nothing to stop a fall should we catch the shoulder and lose balance or something so most often we would take the middle of the pavement or the safest side even if it meant to ride against the traffic until a car came up.  Needless to say that we had our hands on the breaks constantly to be ready for any  emergency  and also to be able to negociate the hairpin turn at a safe speed.. The road was also fairly bumpy which provided an additional hazard at high speed and inconvenience for our sore butt! I had to stop a couple of times to rest my hands as they got quite cramped. I got increasingly tired and irritable even with the endless straighter descent, probably because of the lack of sugar. I found myself unable to enjoy the scenery which was probably beautiful but for some reason I can't recall anymore   We slept at a municipal camping that night in St-Sauveur-Sur Tinee, very quiet campsite with only 3 parties including us. After pitching the tents and having a shower we headed to town for dinner. It sounded like there was only one decent restaurant in town, in an auberge but at the end it wasn't that great  Jean-Francois got drunk with the wine, which was funny as he was talking endlessly, quite unusual for him. We must have hit the pillows by 11:30 that night, full stomach and happy from a well spent day. 
   We left town by 10:30 which is quite early for us!!! For the first time since leaving Vancouver I checked my messages on my answering machine and all I had was old messages from before my departure,and the usual "Can you come to work?" from staffing clerks desperately looking for nurses. We had a long descent again along the Tinee river which is surrounded by a red rock canyon, sometimes pink and quite pretty. The road was hugging the side of a cliff and we just had to make sure the big trucks saw us as we rode around the corners. We also went through  a few tunnels. The heat was bothering me already and it wasn't noon yet.      We cycled until a junction of a national road (read highway) and as the map we were using dated of 1991 things got revamped in here in the meantime and that got us puzzled. There was a 2 km long tunnel built for the southbound traffic, obviously forbidden to cyclists. The northbound people were using the old 2 way road along the river now made into a one way. We didn't have a choice to go against the traffic for 7 km. This was quite stressful and somewhat dangerous but we managed. To relax a bit, reward ourselves and cool down from the heat we stopped for a Coke and some refreshing water at this very conveniently located bar-hotel-restaurant. It was so hot by now!!! The kind of heat that would prevent you from doing anything physical, crushing type. But I was out of luck...  Next was awaiting us the Georges de la Vesubie, a very gentle climb along a river for 21 km to reach the beginning of the real climb for the col de Turini. That gorge was quite pretty (and also hot). The asphalt had s tarted to melt and stuck to the tires should you inadvertantly roll on the melted spots We tried to keep cool by changing our water as frequently as possible for fresh one in the little villages and it would turn boiling hot in no time again. I would refresh my bandana and put it on my head. It would offer a brief moment of coolness...    Lantosque marked the beginning of the climb and the junction for the col de Turini. We met up a group of 10 unloaded cyclists taking a break. We greeted and started to climb at first gently and then more seriously as we had settled to climb a little bit to the next village for our midday break. One by one the cyclists came and passed us. Jean-Francois started to push it a little bit to follow them, and I stayed in the back. The last cyclist to pass was a little bit of a cheater as he was towing himself on a truck, holding himself from the door chassis (kids, don't try this at home). That made Jean-Francois and me protest a bit and laugh. The beginning of the climb was steep and left me out of breath. It sounded as I wasn't alone as the slowest cyclist of the other group had enough of it and was walking his bike. His ego must have warned him it would get bruised as he saw me threatening to pass so he got back on his bike and went again. We had a nice break at La Bollene-Vesubie sitting in the shade at a bar patio. We had a nicoise salad fixed for us and also ate what was in our food cache. For me it was cheese and bread and fruits. Yum. After that break it was 5 PM and we had yet to climb the last pass until the Riviera. 12 more km to go and 1607 m of altitude. It took us 90 min of hard and hot work, with beautiful sceneries to make me forget about the pain. We caught some shepherd dogs at work gathering the mountain goats under the orders and the calls of the shepherd. That was quite cool to surprise the frightened goats at a hairpin turn waiting for the rest of theirs.     The frustrating part of this climb was the constant buzz of the flies around me which made me swear at them profusely and wave my arms around like someone having hallucinations should you have not guessed I was trying to get rid of the flies circling me. They wouldn't leave me alone, I was hot and sweaty, and cranky and could they please leave me alone??? Making it to the top was quite satisfying. We rewarded ourselves with a cold drink with lots of ice at the little hotel. There was no real views to awe on but we were treated to spectacular sceneries on the descent along the George du Piaon.  One of the highlight was to see this church called Notre-Dame de la Menour perched on top of a hill in the middle of the gorge. I was amazed at how every day on this trip I made new discoveries, sceneries to be impressed about.    We were required to climb a little bit before reaching our campsite for the night which reminded me I had quads indeed. We pitched our tents on a not so optimal ground, kind of clayish and uneven, and had a very cold shower to my biggest disappointment. I made dinner sitting in a real chair and around a table to make some change, around some noisy table hockey players. We had on the menu some pasta with tomato sauce, chorizo and vegetables, some beer and black chocolate leftovers for dessert.    Sleep came easy that night.
This morning I finished packing a little early so went sit down in the camping's restaurant and got the pre-ordered croissants and pains au chocolat, and ordered our usual drinks, which cost more than a full lunch at a local sushi place in Vancouver! I decided that Sospel was the right place to get rid of some of my cold weather clothes, some of which I didn't use at all!   I also sent back to my sister in Paris some maps I no longer needed and the set of photo that I had developed. Total, 2.5 kg!!! Jean-Francois also sent some clothes home for just about the same price than me even though it was overseas! Then we went in town for the usual errands, groceries and snacks. All that took more time than it should have as we lingered in the shade sipping on a cold drink. Noon!  Jean-Francois was reluctant to climb yet another pass (because there was this last one) but I didn't mind really, what the heck I thought! Just another one, a small one after the gigantic ones... My body was used to it by now. It was hot hot hot with the noon sun. To pass time Jean-Francois started telling stories and I worked my belly by laughing at them. We were climbing along a mountain so dry, so hot we could have been in an oven and there wouldn't have been any difference. We could feel the mugginess of the ocean. Finally we made it and loyal to the tradition we took pictures.     Then we were awarded with a long descent that lead us over Menton, barely cooling but enjoyable. I was a bit emotional to see the Mediterranean sea, felt pride of finishing a stage in my trip. The traverse of the Alps was done and over with...    All I wanted was to dip my feet in the water, cool down, celebrate with a Coke. Jean-Francois had other plans, wanting to reach the Italian border and stop there. Fair enough, it was only 3 km away. Following the coast we meandered around tourists, pedestrians, strollers, cars, scooters, you name it and finally stopped in the middle of a 2 ways highway that lead in and out of Italy. There used to be a custom check there but not anymore due to the new European Union I suppose. We took pictures in front of the Italy sign, then looking around wanting to find a nice spot to stop, and finding none, sat right down against the custom building and ate a snack, disappointed of not stopping in a better place than just here watching the cars go by. I wanted to have a taste of the riviera, not just a teaser...     Jean-Francois suggested to stop for lunch in Nice which was 20-30 km away. So off we go. We backtracked towards Menton, and beyond. As I had the map on the bike, and mostly leading the way I decided which turns to take and lead Jean-Francois into a peninsula where lived very rich people. It was only a few km detour and I thought we could have nice views and photo opportunities. After a few turns, Jean-Francois demanded to see the map and told me we couldn't fo all the little detours to make it to our destination. Why being so rushed I thought??? I wanted to enjoy myself. On another hand there was a lack of campsites on this coast and we might have to pay big Euros for a hotel if we didn't make it to destination.      So off we go again this time towards Monaco. Traffic was getting bad. It was hilly. Scooters all over zigzagging around the cars. Fumes from the cars. Noise from the Harleys. Heat. Sweat on my shins, arms, back. Dust from the road. Thirst. Traffic light and pedestrians to watch. So much stimuli beside looking around and get a feel of the place that seemed to have lots to offer.We managed to make it to Monaco all in one piece and in the midst of the traffic, after a scary tunnel and negotiating in-ramp and off-ramp we decided to stop on a sidewalk and take a breather and also have a good look at the map to see if there was a quieter alternative. Not 10 seconds after getting off the saddle this cop came out of nowhere and told us we belonged on the road and could we please get off the sidewalk. Wow! For once someone had it right. And for once I wanted to be off the road!!! The cop relaxed a bit when we asked him question about which road to take and told us that yeah, we were on the quieter road....  We crossed yet another castle that would have deserved some visiting and bypassed a peninsula thanks to Jean-Francois tighter vigilance. It must have been 4PM when we made it to Nice, at least the entrance of Nice, at the port. I imagined Nice with a long beach and a walkway. That's where I wanted to be. Jean-Francois had for idea to stop at the post and have food there. it's what we did.  It occurred to me as I am writing these words after the facts that Jean-Francois took a lot of decisions on this trip some of which would have been different have I been on my own. So... Nice... We stopped in a restaurant and Jean-Francois got enticed in a full meal deal. I had a salade nicoise and got into the bread and cheese we already had. Leaving the restaurant Jean-Francois left his very precious baseball cap behind and we had to return to check out again if he forgot it or if he lost it on the way. It was gone. La promenade des Anglais announced itself, and we cycled right on it on the bike path, meandering between brainless tourists. By then the coastal road had 4 lanes each ways so I was glad to use the bike path. Nice beaches, so I have heard.    The bike path finished eventually and we had to go 'where we belonged' on the road. At first we took the bus and taxi lane which was protected from the other lanes. That was good until it ended , and then we joined the cars, motorcycles and scooters in the party and we started a little speeding session, where we cycled-me leading, Jean-Francois drafting at 28-35 km per hour. That was a lot of fun. Jean-Francois would encourage me, letting me know when he had caught up with me if he lost me from a traffic light or else. Then we arrived in Antibes, a charming town with a lot of character. I would have loved to stay there and shop, visit, swim in the sea. I felt really sorry of leaving behind this pretty dress seen in a window... So we left this time for Cannes. Cannes is known for its film festival,actors and actresses hanging out there but we would see none of that, stopping in a Petit Casino for groceries as it was closing. I bought supply for chocolate fondue and other stuff. We gulped a liter of fruit juice in no time and ate cherries and peaches. And we left again. Bye bye Cannes! Our next destination was a campsite. The sun was getting quite low and we wanted to get as close to St-Raphael as possible, Agay where we knew there would be a camping. We also wanted to settle for 2 nights in a decent city where we could eat in a nice restaurant and also have internet acces if possible. The only problem was it was getting late, sun was falling behind the mountains and Jean-Francois was worried of riding in the dark because of poor visibility and dangers of being hit. I didn't worry as much as I knew I was being seen with the fluorescent lights on my bags, and also from the red flashing light I clip on my clothes. I was a bit irritable by that time from feeling rushed and tired and the bike's gears didn't react upon order as well as I would have liked... The coast got really beautiful past Cannes as we wandered according to the moods of the land. The earth and the rocks got quite red-orange tinged with the sunset accentuating the already deep color. We made it to a bay and down a hill there was a sign for a campsite. I stopped there waiting for Jean-Francois to catch up. I knew we had planned to go farther but it was dark and it just made sense to stop now. It was getting close to 10 PM now! The office was closed, no surprise, but we encountered this very chatty Dutch guy that showed us where to go and gave us a good chat. It was nice but we were hungry and tired... We set up camp close to the bathroom among other campers that seemed quiet. It was after being all organized that we noticed those 3 or 4 guys in front of our site that were getting quite drunk and increasingly noisy and obnoxious. I went for a shower and started to make dinner and awaiting for Jean-Francois to come back from his shower and became increasingly pissed off at those losers that were disturbing everybody else around. After a long day cycling this was most unwelcome... Ear plug night was declared. Vomiting from drinking too much didn't deter the other guys from drinking more but eventually they all went to sleep. Me too. 
I let Jean-Francois rise and shine when he would deem appropriate and went to the office to pay our dues and enquired about the washing machine. Jean-Francois and I started a load before heading out to the little store and restaurant for breakfast. We spent 2 hours there reading the paper, shopping for fruits and lunch, sipping on a hot drink, eating our pastries and looking at the map. At noon time we found our clothes neatly placed back into the plastic bag we had left on the washing machine ready to be laid for drying. I got busy with that and Jean-Francois got ready for yet another spring clean up to the bottom of his panniers, and then worked on the bikes.  By that time we were in an oven and it was hard to do anything. I had for mission to work on my journal and catch up to my procrastination. Eventually the thermarest-chair became a flat mattress and I was horizontal and drowsy but the flies would not leave me alone and it got me real cranky. Did I mention how swollen my feet had gotten? I started noticing maybe a day or 2 ago but today it was bad, the right more than the left. I tried to set up my tent so the feet would be a bit higher than the rest so I could fit in my shoes...  After a small lunch made of pate and bread, salad and ice tea, and after a little nap, I wanted to swim in the sea. I wanted to cool down and also, well not every day would we be here, on the French Riviera with clear and inviting water. Jean-Francois for some reason didn't want to swim, but agreed to come with me, and then we'd pick a restaurant to go to later for dinner. We were in a small cove, the sand was beautiful, the water fairly warm to my Canadian standards but I am a wimp when it comes to dip in the water so it took me a while to soak totally , but it was totally refreshing... As I dressed back up I noticed this old woman going topless to my surprise... Ewww... that's all I have to say.  After the visit at the beach we took a walk along the road to check out the restaurant menus. It was restaurant night and Jean-Francois wanted some French gastronomy. He made his choice, I looked around for photos opportunities as the sun was going down and headed back for a refreshing shower.      The restaurant had a nice patio overlooking the water. Unfortunately all the tables with such views were taken but we settled for something fairly nice in the coolness of the evening and made out order. All the time during dinner we had bold birdies flying and diving close to our table and into a nearby tree. Obviously those brats have learned they could get food out of the patrons. Service was slow and we had a fairly young waitress that was funny with her service manners. Every time she was picking up a dish she would announce for herself 'Allez hop!'  We had a good laugh about that. I splurged in a very yummy lobster bisque and some duck for main course. Dessert was not forgotten and we accompanied all that with a good bottle of wine. We headed back to camp full and slightly drunk for a warm night where I took the fly totally out in order to be able to breathe. 
We had a stopover in St-Raphael and found a decent internet station where we had an hour full of e-mail and web site updating. That was nice. There were 2 girls there speaking English only that left before us and then came back as one was looking for her credit card. I helped her with translation when she asked the owner if by any chance he found it in his store. I felt for her. Plastic in the wallet is extra precious when one is traveling. When you lose it, what do you do??? We were promptly on the bike after that, direction St-Tropez and gladly leaving behind the urban traffic. Well... it was temporary as the tourist traffic was trickling in to the beaches as the day was getting by, motorcyclists and all. However the riding was pleasant, we encountered a few training cyclists and also rode by the water along the bay leading to St-Tropez, and watched the cluster of sailing boats racing away. Eventually St-Tropez and its beach worshiper traffic was there and we got in the look out for a grocery store and a bathroom. I wanted to visit a bit of the town and Jean-Francois wanted to go. I guess it was too early for him to stop for lunch. We managed our business in town and then headed to the old town where I took a few pictures and reached a historical site by the water where a monument marked the historical landing of thousands of soldiers on the 15th of August 1944.        Did I mention the heat yet?  Well it was hot! I was drinking and drinking and my mouth kept feeling dry. Past St-Tropez we got into remote area with just about no services at all, as villas with big gates and large fields was our riding environment. I got kind of desperate for water uintil I found this gas station. Funny enough we had to ask for water as the faucets were kept inside even though the taps were outside. We had to negociate another pass today. The Col de Collebasse stands at 129 m. We still had to sweat for this one and my muscles felt really still and tired. The downhill was much better for me but Jean-Francois broke yet another spoke. By that time I was use to the sound of it, and what it meant. We agreed on stopping for lunch at the next town and we found a corner store to by yet some more groceries and a little corner of concrete with some shade to eat our lunch. I leaned against the wall and sat down but got up real fast as I could smell pee... Grrrrr...      We had lunch and Jean-Francois fixed his spoke mumbling and being irritable. My feet were so swollen I could hardly fit them in my shoes so I laid horizontal on the ground and elevated them for a bit for a little relief. More biking after that and we found a bike path to make our life easier. The riding was nice up and down cliffs and hills to make the riding interesting. After a nectarine break I noticed I lost a screw off one of my cleat as I couldn't put it back on the pedal. Oh-oh! I walked back a hundred meter bent in half looking for the screw but to no avail. I would just have to be careful and check the screws everyday.       At 7:30 PM we reached a grocery store and I begged the security guard to let me in as they were closing. We bought supply for dinner and also a 2 liters of iced tea (room temperature) that we gulped in no time at all. We had more biking to do as there was a campsite sign on the map in La Crau which we eventually reached as the sun was getting low. The locals in La Crau were not sure about the campsite, which is not a good sign. We were finally directed out of town for a few kilometers where we had a 300 m of the bumpiest road I have ever encountered. I was hoping that I would not lose any more screws. At the end of that road on our left side there was a cluster of dirty and somewhat unkept trailers, a kind of a commune with dirty naked children, barking dogs, chicken and roosters, and old cars with flat tied and missing doors. We passed that and entered the campsite, and found no one around. The office was closed. A few trailers here and there but no one to be seen. We found an acceptable site and I inspected the facilities. Everything was very unkept and dirty, dusty and obviously had not been in use for a while. There was no power working and cobwebs everywhere. The bathroom were Turkish style and really dirty so finding a friendly tree was more appealing to me.  I washed using a cloth and hot water that I warmed on the stove and washed my hair under the tap by our campsite. It was dark when I started making dinner and as I was cooking, Jean-Francois was bathing in the buff by the tap until he saw this car coming around the corner with the headlights on. He went in the hiding behind a bush and I had a good laugh! Gastronomy of the day was sweet and sour cashews and vegetable stir-fry over a bed of rice. Something good in the midst of a spooky campsite. 
We headed into town for breakfast. La Crau is not very big but big enough to look for the downtown core. We found the bakery, our first stop and then a coffee shop, where we sat and sipped on coffee and hot chocolate and Coca Light for me watching the people doing their morning business. There were old women with their baskets full of produce, young woman holding a child in their hand, old men walking their dogs. Now, so much to say about the dogs  Usually small pocket things, some with hairdo worse than mops, some with little girl's barrettes on top of their head. Then the inevitable boy driving his scooter like a maniac. All kinds of people       We lingered in that little place until it got real hot then declared it was time to go before it got warmer. Was it ever hot! We first passed through a truck route, nothing so interesting and then a more forested area, starting to gain elevation in the process. Still on busy roads, we had to negociate the road with others, until Roquebrussanne, where we took a left turn in this quietest little road. Boy was it ever hot! There was a short climb in the process of crossing that section of country and I managed to complain about it. Fortunately a nice downhill, almost cooling  followed and we stopped in this lost and dead little village  in the middle of nowhere where we treated ourselves with a popsicle. The owner's husband was watching the World's cup and we were not allowed to go near the freezer to go pick our own frozen treat because we would disturb the man and his very important football match  We took the quiet road again meandering among fields of sweet nothing, surprising lizard in the process, then we hit the vineyards. It was fairly pleasant riding once you get passed the heat. St-Maximin became our lunch spot and Jean-Francois decided on stopping in this quiet park facing the police station. (gendarmerie) I was not so impressed because I didn't have any access to the mandatory Coca Light (diet Coke). I almost fell asleep on the bench even though I was quite uncomfortable and reluctant to leave when it was time to go. (This girl is never happy)    We then headed toward Mont Ste-Victoire, a very cherished mountain by Paul Cezanne, a famous painter that dedicated his whole life comtemplating and painting this famous and unique mountain. The way along the mountain was slow hot and painful. No services were available to cool us down, I was tired and irritable. I just couldn't understand how come this bike was so slow and what the hell was wrong with me for biking so slow. I got so discouraged on my poor progress that I was ready to cry and give up. For some reason I never realized that we were climbing up to 500 m and never clued in that I was so slow because we were indeed climbing  Once we were going down to Aix-en-Provence my mood improved a bit although still tired. I thought Aix should have that something interesting to see. It is a city made in circle and more of a student city than anything else. It was close to 7 PM when we made it there and were racing to find some store to buy food and cold drink. For some reason there weren't any in the big arteries we took so we ventured downtown in the pedestrian only streets. There was a lot of people walking the streets that evening and all towards a gathering spot. We would later learn there was a music festival of some sort that night. We sat down with a 2-liter of iced tea, some chocolate and taboule, our energy food before continuing. We asked some cops the way out of town using the quieter routes and for some reason we must have missed some instructions because we ended up just where we didn't want to be, right on the highway and up a very steep ramp to get on the said highway to boot. By that time I had a bit more energy and I was ok. We were heading towards Rognes, a city that didn't have a camping sign by its name on the map but we took a chance thinking that there might now be a camping as the map was 10 years old. In the meantime the sun was getting low and Jean-Francois was worried about riding in the dark. There were tense moments looking for the right road as we had different opinions as of which road to take and we were trying to make sense of the map, and compare it to the clues of the environment. At the end, I just didn't care. Whatever road we took would be fine with me. Eventually we found the right road and made it to Rognes. It was pitch dark. We asked around for a campsite and were told there wasn't any in here. So we asked for a hotel and we were told again that there wasn't any. We were directed to the church and told to ring the priest, to ask him about the possibilities to camp around. The priest was already in bed and didn't have any answer for us not being from the area. We looked around for a bed and breakfast, asked around and were then directed to this house that was 4 or 5 km out of town. We geared up in our most reflective clothing and flashing light and ventured on a very dark road, seeing nothing but when the cars would pass by. Fortunately they were very good with us leaving lots of space and slowing down when they passed by. We looked for a sign of the B&B and finally found it but the work wasn't all done! We had to bike through a dirt road until a gate where a row of lights lit as we passed the said gate. That made our way to the house easier and made us a bit more hopeful to find a place to stay overnight. By that time (it was 10:20 PM) all I wanted was a place to sleep, regardless of the price. We rang the bell at the door and asked if there was a room available, excusing ourselves profusely for the late intrusion. We were quoted a high price for the last room available (84 Euro) and were shown this very nice room which we took on the spot. (How could we refuse and leave at this time of night after almost 130 km of riding in the heat?)  We took care of the bikes, got the clothes and food upstairs, had a delightful shower in a real bathroom, and I made something to eat. All I wanted was to sleep. The bedroom was something to see, quite nice with a French antique flavor to it. Sleep came easy that night.   
After more packing and bike set up we left this domain and went back on the road, thankfully downhill for the next little while. The next village we stopped for real size croissants as promised and also for fruits and other groceries. I walked briefly into a pottery outdoor market and was impressed with the talent, a lot of pieces caught my attention but I couldn't buy anything at all and I knew it so I passed quickly. A little farther down we were treated with a very nice little town with cobblestone in its downtown core, narrow roads and quaint little stores. Although it was Sunday morning there were a lot of people out there sipping on coffee and also people watching the world cup. There was also a medieval castle nearby which I wanted to see from up close and personal but we didn't have time. The riding towards our first pass of the day was warm but scenic, as we left the villages we got into some rocky, dry and also increasingly hilly relief. We started to climb, gradually on a very pleasant road but in the middle of it Jean-Francois broke yet another spoke! The top was quoted at 499m and we stopped for lots of water. Was it ever hot!!!     The nice descent took us to Apt with is a larger city that would be our lunch spot. There was a market going on in the core area and would be the largest we would encounter. There was a lot of people around, it was hard to find a path for our bike and us but we managed and found a shady corner behind the olive salesman. Jean-Francois was not very happy about his broken spoke and about the low mileage so far today and I sensed he wanted to be left alone so I looked around for grocery items, some cold drinks and I needed a roll of film for my camera. I bought some more cherries, some bread and also stopped at the cheese counter held by 2 brothers that looked alike. They made me taste their cheese until I liked what was under my palate and served me some. I really enjoyed my shopping around in these markets... There were Provencal tablecloths and fabrics to die for, and also all kinds of crafts. Back to the back of the olive counter Jean-Francois finished his repair and we had some lunch in the shade. It was so hot it was hard to bear. We made the decision not to attempt Mont Ventoux today due to the late time and hot weather. It was just not realistic. We settled for the town at the foot of the mountain and we would summit in the morning tomorrow. We treated ourselves to an ice cream at a bar while everybody else but us was watching the world cup on tv.     Eventually it was time to get back on the road and we took a relatively quiet road towards Murs  where I experienced my first lavender fields. I was impressed even if there was no colors yet in the fields. I could imagine for myself what it would be like in August...    The climb to Murs was painful due to the heat. It was really hard to bear and I was drinking at a scary rate. We would later learn it was 39 degrees that day (102 F) with no wind. So arriving to Murs, a lost little town on top of the hill we looked for the fountain which was invaded by wasps but we didn't care really. I would have like to plunge in the water, but as some people were watching I settled for dipping my bandana in and wetting my hair and refreshing my face. There were few old folks selling cherries on the side of the street and we sat down with them for a little conversation and more cherry splurging... We bought another pound or 2 from them and ate the samples they were offering us. We learned that there was a campsite in Sault which was not marked on the map and that would put us in better position to climb Mont Ventoux tomorrow so we settle for this last minute change of direction.     Waving our new friends goodbye we took a turn towards Sault and passing several cherry trees, started climbing slowly and gradually towards the Col de La Ligne. We had the delight of a rabbit crossing in front of us and a lizard sighting, and I also saw a snake that Jean-Francois missed before the pass. The Col de La Ligne is also called "Mur de la Peste" or pest wall, which was a boundary preventing people to cross to prevent pest propagation many years ago.    The downhill was wonderful although the road was not optimal with the bumps to watch and irregularity of the pavement preventing me to go at the speed I wanted. We had a wonderful view over a gorge at some point and went down some more. I missed the turnoff for Sault so we had to ride a few more kilometers to reach Sault and Jean-Francois was not impressed that I made a mistake. He was very tired and mind you so was I. Sault was on top of a hill so our last kilometers were spend going up that hill and Jean-Francois ran out of steam! We stopped at a junction to eat melted chocolate out of the wrapper and I went across the road to see this huge memorial in honor of the soldiers who died for the freedom of everybody.  The campsite was full of mosquitoes and we set up in a zombie mode. I had a delightful shower and we had the visit of a middle age couple that had been cycling in Corsica and now were heading back home. They were interested to chat and I was interested in eating and crash in my bed! We had some pasta and a bit of wine and then headed to bed. 
There was some sort of road race in Sault when we sat down in front of our yummy pastries and coffee, so we watched the people running basically by the tables outside of the bar where we were sitting. I splurged in croissants and pain au chocolat, fruits and fruit juice. Anything to get me up that mountain! Sault happened to be a charming town on top of a hill and had some quaint little shops and some views over lavender fields and the mountain. I enjoyed it.  Eventually it was time to leave, and I got a little nervous thinking we had like 26 km of climbing to do to reach the top. Fortunately we had a little time to warm up as we had to climb down the hill and across a brief valley before climbing. The air was still fresh, the sun was there, and the views awesome. It was a gentle climb to start with and Jean-Francois got ahead leaving me with the flies to deal with. Some cyclists passed us waving us, with nothing on the bike but themselves. Some of them were in their sixties!!! So the climbing was ok to my surprise. Not too much traffic, I would just guess it was still early for the motorcyclists and it was just fine with me. Otherwise the climb was uneventful until Chalet Reynard. Just before that point we encountered some chalets and then a little downhill which took us to the chalet where all the action was in preparation of the car rallye. There was a bunch of fire trucks and inevitable firefighters, some police cars and other volunteers ready to close up the road at noon. They all gasped with the sight of our loaded bikes !!! It was almost funny. We stopped and went in the restaurant and I wanted some bubbly real bad and could not believe my luck... They had some Pepsi!!! It would be my best find of the trip... I bought 2. It was very expensive but I couldn't care less. It tasted really good. We also purchased some post cards, I ate some fruits and other energy food, filled up with water and then after watching so many cyclists climbing the steep uphill off Chalet Reynard, it was our turn. I was a little anxious about this last section that was averaging 8% . The crowd of  the outdoor patio, the firefighters and the rest of them watched us take some speed to climb as I quickly downshifted to the easiest gear... 6 kilometers of hell it was but I have been told that it can be worse than that if the wind gets in the way. Business as usual. Breathe, get into 'the zone' that place where you just spin, and get the bike up there...       Jean-Francois got ahead, and I just pedaled, into my little world, looking around and being impressed I was here. I was glad to 'have to stop' to take pictures, as it allowed to catch up on my breath. There was more traffic than the first leg, motorcycles and all, some more cyclists, some of them that were hauled by truck and were going down, cars. I was panting and my legs were sore. I joined Jean-Francois at the Tom Simpson memorial where we paid our respects to the guy and looked at the views.      Soon enough it was time to attack the last kilometer of the climb, not the easiest. There was a snack bar maybe 400 m before the top and lots of people around there, and I got applauds and encouragements from the tourists but I was panting and very concentrated to keep on pedaling and make it up there. The last u-turn was a notch steeper, and I had to weave my way between a biker that was walking his bike and pedestrians. My lungs were ready to explode! Then there was a gate, and people chatting up there as it was still climbing and I had to tell them to get out of the way so I don't fall or put them in danger. That was when I got applauded and I almost started crying... Few more pedal strokes and there was nothing more to climb, and I just let the bike roll and met up with Jean-Francois, totally out of breath... There we were. We did it. I did it. There were lots of cyclists up there, having climbed their Ventoux. but nobody had 65 pounds of gear on their bike. It was nice to see all those people sharing their love of biking... We must have spent half an hour eating more food, drinking, shopping for post cards and souvenirs and taking pictures. The views were a little bit hindered by the haze but still beautiful.            Well rested, we left and started the long descent on the other side. It was warm but the wind was cooling and lovely on the skin, I just loved it. Rather than short switchbacks, we had long stretches of straight road allowing for high speed... Cool. My top speed reached 68.4 km/hr. I stopped in Malaucene at the foot of Ventoux and waited for Jean-Francois noticing how warmer it was down there, almost unbearable. We stopped at this restaurant where we had cooling drinks and some kind of meal before going again. We hung out a while, waiting for the heat to just go away but it just wouldn't leave. Eventually we had to go, and fortunately we still had 300 m to go down to Avignon, over 40 km. The first section was very pleasant, the one to Carpentras. It was wine country and sceneries were fabulous though there was much traffic. I sang along and it went well. From Carpentras to Avignon was a little tougher, though flat. I am sure my blood sugar crashed, I had to stop, was low in energy, and finding our way was a little trickier to avoid the busy road and still avoid doing extra mileage.  I wanted to see Avignon. I was told it was quite pretty. There was much to see I was told. I mentionned to Jean-Francois that I wanted to see Avignon and that if we were just to pass by, that we might just as well avoid the urban area and cross the Rhone river where it would be quieter. So it was with trust that we would visit that I followed him as he chose the route. But once in town, all of a sudden, what was most important was finding food and get the hell out of town. That was very disappointing to me, leaving me thinking what type of trip I signed up for. We crossed town, and sat down on the sidewalk against a building to gulp some 2 liters of Iced Tea, and eat chocolate pudding. Sitting nearby outside from a small pub was a drunk guy that made a joke to my intention and it was not funny at all. Then we got on the lookout for a bathroom for me and I found one of those public pay bathrooms that are supposedly self cleaning in between uses. Jean-Francois was my guinea pig and I changed my mind when I saw him coming out of it.    So we cycled a little farther down and I was coaxed by the urgency of nature call to ask a restaurant if I could please use their facilities. It's the one thing I really don't like doing, asking to use the bathroom when I am not a patron of the place. But this time I had to go, it was an emergency... So I was ready to ask but the waitress and the waiter were talking together, and I didn't bother after waiting a bit and just went. There. That was that easy...  Getting out of town was very hairy. We were looking for the right bridge to take, and once we had it, could not return. It looked to me like a highway, no shoulder and very fast driving traffic. We got honked at a few times and we had to negociate a few off and on ramps. This was the only option we had to reach our destination, and when you are racing for the sunset and for your dinner, you don't question... We stopped once for a bit of a breather in the middle of a decent hill and had a cold drink and finally reached Remoulins where supposedly we would find a campsite. We had to look for it. I saw this lady walking with a duck in her hands and she didn't looked impressed. I gathered that the duck escaped his yard. I laughed out loud and that made me feel better after the stressful time on the highway. Our campsite of the night was a top notch fully catered campsite, with lovely showers and bathroom. Interrestingly enough those were mixed- not sex segregated.  And also a restaurant. I set up camp, had a shower and rushed to the restaurant before the kitchen closed and had time to gulp a beer while Jean-Francois had his shower (by now you need to wonder whether he has more body parts than anybody else in the world). The evening was very pleasant and the food got down well... I had a salad for entree and a pizza that was yummy. I was really surprised that they didn't accept credit cards and got caught with little money in hands and they accepted that I pay the following morning. The waitress didn't even take my name down, trusting we would be there. 
We only had to cycle a few kilometers before standing in front of this beauty that is the Pont du Gard. Double decked, out of nowhere,  all I could do was stand there and admire. I snapped a few shots and then off we went for our day ride. We agreed that this would be a good day to go the distance which would put us in good position in prevision of a day off in a medium size city that was Millau.          The day was already hot and I kept complaining it was soooo hot. Jean-Francois decided it was not hot at all, trying to trick his mind I guess. We rode with a head wind most of the day, and not the cooling kind. I was sweating from every sweat gland of my body, especially the forearms and the shins. The ride was enjoyable, being in countryside amidst orchards, vineyards and quiet roads. We kept hopping from village to village, most of them dead quiet. We were offered a rolling hill terrain, the type to make you work out to make it on top, and added to the head wind and the crushing heat, did nothing to make us feel strong and full of energy.      In the shade we found a fruit stand and it was a good occasion to sip on a can of iced tea and try some fresh ripe peaches. The village of Arnet was dead otherwise, no one to be seen around. I was hoping to find a store for films for my camera but to no avail. Eventually leaving a friendly stray dog behind we got back on the bike, stopping just a few hundred meter farther down the road in a bar to fill up our water bottles. Water is in short supply here,there are  no water fountains in the villages. However it is a law in France that bars cannot refuse people water even if we don't buy anything. The barmaid gave us ice cubes along with the water which we were thankful for. One rather drunk patron woman could not believe we were headed to Florac, maybe 100 km away from here, and told us it was easier to go by car... I made a mistake of taking the wrong road again which made us take a forced detour and Jean-Francois was rather pissed off by this error. Again I am carrying the map as my handle bar bag is very handy to hold a map right on top so I am the navigator.  I am quite used to making mistakes, it happens to the best of us and I know I am not perfect. We made a stop to Ladignan for lunch just 20 km down the road, where everything was closed in the small town but an empty bar held by a mother and daughter. I gulped a Coke before anything else and we hid inside trying to hide from the sun and keep somewhat cool. Jean-Francois seemed to lack energy by that time, not feeling too well. I waited until the stores reopened and went for groceries, buying some really yummy chips, grapes and more of those yummy cherries. I also phoned my sister from a very hot phone booth (I almost asphyxiated) which was really nice and headed back in the bar. Jean-Francois realized we would not make it to Florac today as it was just to far considering the heat, and there were a couple of passes to 700 m we had to climb prior to Florac. I didn't mind. A shorter day would be fine with me. After all I am on vacations! So we settled for St-Jean-du-Gard. It was hard to get back on the bike after such a long break but it felt like the heat was not so bad after all. And we were treated to a bit of a downhill to start with. There was just about 14 km to cover to Anduze where we stopped and I bought much needed films for my camera and a little farther down the road we had a grocery store to buy supply for our dinner. Another 14 km was separating us from our final destination and a few hills were indicated on the map. The views were nice although the shoulders were narrow and we had to focus on the traffic. There was a river by the side of the road with people swimming and it felt really inviting. On the outskirts of St-Jean-du-Gard we stopped on the foot of a hill and were puzzled as for where to go. There were no campsites posted and it sounded like town was on the left. Jean-Francois didn't want to do another detour today and wanted to make the decisions. I was tired, stressed out and just stepped back, let him decide whatever. All I wanted was a nice shady area to pitch my tent and a nice shower. We ended up being directed up the hill and then down into town. Jean-Francois was pissed off at the guy because turning left would have taken us at the same place and without the complications of the hill. I didn't care by now. The little town was quite pretty. Nice patios for people to sit and enjoy a drink and little boutiques. Sounded like we would have the choice of places to go the next day for breakfast. To our dismay though the campsite was like 4 km away from town, and we had to retrace our steps, but on the other side of the river. The campsite was quiet and held by this young guy that had great dreams for his new business. He was working on the yard planting a tree and showed us around walking us through the sites. He showed us what was available, and showed us imaginary divisions of each sites. I had to laugh. Well we didn't care so this one site in the middle would do just fine. He started talking to us, happy to have someone to be a recipient of a conversation. Then after a while as we were unloading he realized that we were quite tired, stopped in the middle of a phrase, turned his heels and walked away. What a different character! I hope that we didn't insult him. I pitched my tent on an ant nest and as they started climbing my feet and stinging a bit I decided I should step out of their territory and change spot. What followed is well worth forgetting. To this day I am still hurt by what happened. I will just say that I was very upset and puzzled, contemplated packing back up and leave on the spot. Instead I had a shower, biked the 8 km return to town to speak with my sister as she needed to talk to me some more, and came back to camp to make dinner. I was not even hungry but ate in prevision of the day to come as it would be a long one to make up for the distance we didn't cover. Words are not coming up to talk about that evening so maybe I should stop here. 
   We took a while to find  what we needed for breakfast and sat down at a bar for the usual fare of coffee and hot chocolate.  There was a cute cat looking at us from the edge of a roof wanting to come down but not daring to jump, then he got absorbed by the sight of a bird in a nearby tree and it was the first time I saw a cat drooling.  Eventually we left the business of the town behind, and headed up the mountain, on a crest pathway called 'Corniche des Cevennes'. The first mountain pass was rather easy but steady climb in a forested area, quiet and peaceful. It was enjoyable. We went as high as 597 meters and then had a bit of a downhill offering views of the other side of the crest.    Old wavy mountains were all around, offering a panorama not as spectacular as the Alps but still. I was curious to see where it lead. We had a stop at Pompidou, a small village out of nowhere for coffee and a bit of energy food. We watched a small group of Dutch cyclists leave town pushing their bikes up the hill and it looked painful. The hill was rather steep indeed. When it got time to climb that hill I had a fight with the laws of gravity. It must have been one of the steepest hills I have encountered since La Bonette but I climbed it all up and we met up wit the Dutch party just around the corner as they were taking a breather. The climb didn't finish there, there were a few sharp turn, more steep climbing and then we reached a high plateau and the cycling got much more comfortable. And eventually cycled down the crest with a change of valley, in a very spectacular way.      There were tight hairpins to negociate and really nice panoramas to appreciate. Eventually we had to climb a little section again before reaching Florac where we stopped for lunch. A cyclist in training got into a conversation with Jean-Francois which made the cycling a little less painful up the little section and then we found ourself sitting in this caf watching the other patrons watching a World cup match. Florac seems to be a very young city with lots of young families. It was sitting in a valley and there were mountains all around, actually quite a pretty setting. The bar didn't offer food at the time we got in but let us eat our own food while we gulped iced tea and other drinks.  Eventually we had to leave because we had still lots of distance to cover today. We were hoping to reach Millau where we would take a day off tomorrow. A few kms riding lead us to the Gorges du Tarn turn-off, we were offered another dcor different than everything else we saw before. Lush at first, we followed this river entering small villages, sometimes gaining a bit of altitude and leaving the river down lower, sometimes winding through very narrow corridors in between rocky tunnels and rocky walls.    It was just spectacular! The river was a great occasion for canoeing and swimming and at places it was just a big canyon. As for the cycling, most of it was downhill so lots of the time we had a little push in the back from mother nature  It was another hot day and once in a while we would stop for cold drink and for energy. Another of those days where the pavement was found melting at places and sticking to the wheels.       After 143 km we entered Millau and rather easily found a camping near the downtown core, at the foot of a mountain where dozen of parasails launch their attire in the air and swirl in the air endlessly. We took the first campsite we found and set up after gulping  down a celebration beer at the office. That night we treated ourselves to pizza at a neighbouring restaurant. We had poor service and the pizza was burnt but it would do for the night      
   The laundry took a little longer than expected as I chose the longer cycle, and then hung the clothes on the fence as I had left my clothesline behind somewhere. We went to town for part 2 of our breakfast and looking for an internet station mainly. There was also a castle according to the map and I wanted to see. Jean-Francois wanted to check out the menus for good food for our dinner tonight.     The internet session was 2 Euros an hour, an incredible price considering I have paid as high as 10 Euros an hour in other parts of France and in Switzerland. We were given good computers and I managed to talk to my brother live with yahoo messenger. Ahhh, technology! We wandered a bit in the streets of Millau, looked for the castle, didn't find it, or if it was what it was, it wasn't impressive. We looked for restaurants and settled for one that looked good and offered some good menus. I was tired of walking by the time we headed back to our campsite. My legs were protesting as they were not used to the walking anymore.     The afternoon was spent cleaning the bikes for Jean-Francois and attempting to write for me. I had been neglecting my journal for a while which is fairly unusual when I travel as I love keeping track of everything. For some reason, likely because of the company and also because of chronic late arrivals at campsites, darkness and fatigue, it was just not possible to write as much. I had a nice shower to help me cool down and discovered some fungal infection  underneath my feet as I didn't manage to find my flip flops back home and was using the public showers bare feet. My shoes were pretty stinky too, and if I left my socks in my tent at night I was sure that one of those nights I would be found dead asphyxiated. Even the shoes in the vestibule were not acceptable anymore. Something needed to be done  The dinner at the restaurant was quite good, good old French cuisine. The restaurant walls were all stone with dim lighting making a really nice warm atmosphere.  All the tables outside were taken so we had one inside, and we sipped a nice cocktail for apperitif. The food was really good and so was the wine. I forgot how I made it back to camp but obviously did.     
We were given a few kilometer warm up before climbing a decent hill to get out of town. There was a big semi truck traffic and again everybody was very respectful of us. The downhill on the other side was very nice and I remember looking around feeling happy to absorb myself in riding and scanning the horizon for interesting sightseeing.  I was looking forward to make it to St-Affrique, as the name was very inspiring. I was curious to see if there would be huts, maybe some herds of elephants and zebras... None of that. Actually we had to climb another decent hill and the decent stretched all the way into town, and I discovered a happy city that would have deserved some visiting. I refilled my water bottles at the pub as the fountain's water was not potable and we carried on out of town towards our junction. The landscape was slowly changing, very subtly but it was hard to say in which way. A little story about the junction's rest area. This was a nice looking one and offered some rest rooms! We had to jump on the occasion, and have a little rest, and visit the bathrooms... Well outside was better than in, and I changed my mind very fast. The turkish style toilet, despite newer facilities were not maintained at all and it was all so gross... We met a trucker in need of human contacts and had a chat with him for a while. We learnt that the soccer's world cup was not over yet and the final match would be Germany against Bresil.  A little farther down the road we found our lunch spot in Belmont, where a really nice cathedral overrides the skyline. For so much room around with fields and everything, the town was made so tight and small streets and all I couldn't even find my way to the cathedral to check it out. I purchased some supply to take care of the fungus that was growing underneath my feet and just sat down and rested in the shade. We were sitting by a little coffee/smoke shop and were listening to a couple of retired  locals discussing the town's difficulties to attract tourists.     Back on the road again, we were given a hill to deal with and a crest's ride and we managed both just fine despite the heat. The sceneries on the crest were not spectacular but still at least gave me something to do. It felt like a long time to me up there. It was agricultural lands all around, with rolling hills. We took a small detour for the Col de Sie for the picture and had a lovely descent to Lacaune, a medium size town where we stopped and gulped a 2 liter of warm iced tea.       We also bought supplies for dinner that night and took off out of town again. Next was the Foret de Montroucous which offered quiet and peaceful riding in the shade. In that area every little town had their memorial remembering children that never came back from war. It made me reflect on how awful it would be to have a loved one going to war and never see him again.  We ended up in Brassac, after 105 km and with a camping in town. The day was not so young anymore and we still had a fair distance to the next campsite so we opted to stop here to the city campsite. It was the cheapest ever for a whopping 4.80 Euros!  We ate Knorr's noodles for dinner watching a thunderstorm rolling in but fortunately in never came over our tent, just a few drops and that's it. It just cooled us down for the night which was just delightful.   
This morning's cycling took us through some green and lush forest, and through small towns with the same war memorials described yesterday. I really enjoyed myself as it was very quiet and peaceful. The mist provided a mysterious effect to the surrounding and just kept me comfortable on the bike. I was hoping that it would clear out for the visit of Carcassonne.  Cycling through Mazamet marked the end of one stage and announced the beginning of climbing and crossing Montagne Noire. We ate a Snicker each for energy and started a steep ascent just out of town, for a respectable 800 meters elevation gain. I was impressed with myself for maintaining a speed of 10 km an hour for that climb, and I thought I must be getting in good shape after all!     The descent towards Carcassonne was just wonderful, a long, long descent for 10 or 15 kilometers. By that time we entered Carcassonne we had cycled 85 km without a break and I was ready for one! We cycled along the Canal du Midi where lots of houseboats driven by tourists taking their holidays boating around from town to town. I thought it was a pretty romantic way to travel! My first sighting of Carcassonne had me impressed and left me in awe. Mind you I was hungry and the first thing I needed was to put some energy in my body.  We pedalled to the entrance of the Cite and walked the bike inside where we found very narrow streets and a lot of shops catering for the tourists. I was led by Jean-Francois to a central court and then a quieter section where we sat on a bench and then decided to sit down at the restaurant across the little park where we were. I ordered some fries and salad, and Jean-Francois had a full lunch deal, steak and all. I wanted to visit and as Jean-Francois had been here already, he decided to stay put and I promised to come back in half and hour or so. I just wandered in the stores, and also took some pictures, bought a couple of post cards. I enjoyed being there, would have liked to visit the pay section but in the same time was ready to move along. Being with so many people was getting to me after a while and I needed back to the solitude of the road again.            Out of town we cycled through vineyards and followed the Aude river. It was really enjoyable riding but we could see a thunderstorm on the horizon and it was coming our way it seems. Again I missed a turn at some point and we found ourselves on the busier road, which made Jean-Francois furious. It didn't really made our ride longer but we had to deal with heavy traffic instead of the quieter vineyard crossing. Oh well. It allowed me to stop at a fruit stand and buy a kilo of cherries for tonight.    Finding the campsite in Limoux wasn't so easy and we had to ask around, then cross town, and found it a few kilometers away. I would have liked some beer but then it would have meant returning into town and I was not ready to do that. I was very tired and fell asleep while Jean-Francois entertained our neighbors. It happened that this couple and him met in a campsite in Southern France last year! Small world. 
We went in town for the usual fare of croissants and hot drinks, and I managed to drop all the pastries on the floor at the bakery, leaving a mess of crumbles behind, apologizing profusely to the owner. Then we went to sit down in a pedestrian square and sat down to eat and drink. People watching is a great thing to do, especially people and their pets. A lady and her dog under her arm came and talk to us, probably in need of social contacts. The cycling went just fine for me. I was just back into my inner thoughts as I was pedaling away. I left Jean-Francois way behind for some reasons, and when I reached the next big town, I sat down in front of a grocery store waiting for him. By that point I was wondering if it was time to just say goodbye. It sounded like we just didn't have much to say to one another, and I felt some kind of tension installing. When he arrived, the need to get groceries prevailed and all was forgotten for a while. Quillan was crossed and we found some turkish public toilets (I am getting better at aiming now) and then we headed for the hill that would take us beck to the mountains. It was an easy climb for me, the views were great and soon we had our first pass under the belt. Again I found the writings aimed at bike racers on the pavement and had to stop when I saw Lance's name. It got me distracted for a while. Some more climbing led us to the Col de Coudon at 833 meters.         We found a lunch spot in a lost little village called Espezel. Couple of intersections, no one in sight, no access to a prized can of Coke, let alone Pepsi. We sat down at the public fountain and ate there. I had a couscous salad and some bread. The flies and other bugs were ravenous here and it was irritating. A huge horse and it's cavalier came by, and a lost cyclist that didn't talk to us.    We thought we'd stop at the next village for cold or hot drinks. We were riding on the Plateau de Sault, higher elevation with mountains in the horizon. We were indeed in the Pyrenees...     The next village had a little caf and 2 stars hotel where a few young woman were smoking like locomotives. It was getting quite cool at that point and the clouds were rolling in, so after hot chocolate, dressed up and went for more riding, hoping for the best.  We were hit by the rain in Belcaire where we sought refuge first in a bus stop then a tourist information where we waited half an hour or one hour. Thunder was going at it and the rain was heavy at times. Eventually, rain or not we had to go providing that the thunderstorm was done and over with, so we braved it out. At times it was barely raining and the cycling was comfortable. We had some more climbing to do, as the Col des 5 Freres was standing at 1253 meters. It was nice riding. That was probably the only pass I didn't take a picture as I didn't want to stop and freeze to death, and it had started raining some more. The way down was like cycling into a freezer and I felt my extremities stiffening and getting like popsicles. I stopped at Camurac where there was a very inviting caf. The thunder came back and felt it would be better to call it a day. It took a while to make a decision as of what to do but eventually settled for a bed and breakfast or something of that sort and found a 'gite' which is a mountain type hostel primarily aimed at backpackers touring in the Pyrenees. For the modest sum of 10 Euros we were given a bed, a roof and access to the kitchen and the garage for the bikes. Our host made us feel at home at the 'Gite de la Marmite' and I was very thankful to hurry in the shower to thaw my hands and feet... The evening was spent trying to dry the clothes (with no luck), sipping on hot tea, reading a book and just dozing... I was wanting to make baked potatoes as a special treat as we had access to an oven but my cooking tonight was totally disgusting... Jean-Francois was pretty polite to eat it all that night but mind you, it must have been out of hunger!!! 
We ate a really hearty breakfast this morning, Jean-Francois with fried eggs and me with cereals and yogurt and pastries. Yummy! We headed back to the grocery store that morning as we managed to spot a computer in the corner and paid a small fee for half an hour for both of us to check out the mail. Then waving the dog goodbye we left, to climb the first col of the day which was easily summitted.  That was col de Marmare.     Then we headed to the next one which was Col de Chioula standing at 1431 m. That one was nice to reach as it marked a stage for me, the last hill before the serious climb of Andorra. We took a break, I had a bite, dressed up for the descent and a French couple came to talk to us and wish us luck and courage.    The descent was great although very very cold. I got my fingers and toes frozen and it took a while to thaw. Ax-les-Thermes looks like a pretty town. Jean-Francois had a spoke to repair from the descent into town and was very unhappy about that one. I kept busy in the meantime by visiting around, window shopping and phoning my sister for the last time before heading back in Paris. Once the mechanic finished his task on the bike we had something to eat among a group of motor bikers that invaded our bench and then left for another country... What was to come was only uphill to Andorra-La-Vella, passing from 720 m in Ax-les-Thermes to 2407 m at the highest over 35 km. At first it was a gentle climb so I took on the lead and span the wheels. Averaging 12 to 14 km an hour I remember the traffic at first heavy but then as the valley opened up a bit and the traffic didn't seem as heavy or at least noticeable. The cycling was pleasant for me as I felt full of energy and was curious to see what was ahead. The mountains grew closer and higher, and unfortunately the clouds got lower too. We made a stop at L'Hospitalet, a small village that was just at the right place for a lunch break before the steeper grades of the summit. We ate outside, on a bench then went at the bar for coke and coffee and we witnessed the victory of Bresil over Germany at the World cup. We cheered for the end of the tournament as that was the only thing that Europeans had in mind those days!!!    Heading back outside it seemed to be much cooler and dressed up for it. We noticed the clouds getting thicked which got me a bit worried about being noticed by the traffic so I clipped my red flashing light to my clothes and started climbing. We didn't have a clue where we were, where we were going but we got encouragements from the drivers by a thumb up out of the window, a cheery hunk and also someone screamed to me 'T'es la meilleure!' (You're the best) That one was priceless and gave me shivers. This was in a tougher section where the climbing was steeper and we were sure working hard so encouragements were welcome. We reached Pas de la Casa, where a big post was announcing we were in Andorra. This town looked like a shopper's paradise with bargains and neon signs everywhere, lots of traffic and of course big line-up at the border like it would be at the Canada-US border on a long week end. I would have loved to stop for a look around but it was cold, we had yet some more km to go and some more climbing to do. I ran in a store and bought some drinks for the road and we were back on the road.    The last of the uphill section was a bit tough, climbing in hairpin when my muscles were already protesting from the work out. On one turn we notices some mountain peaks as we emerged over the clouds and on the next turn, we saw some gas stations and nowhere else to climb. It was really weird and somewhat disappointing to find a couple of gas stations at 2407 m as it didn't fit there. Imagine the gas truck that needs to bring the fuel on top of the mountain for the delivery... We celebrated the summit with chocolate, and saw that on the other side there were no longer clouds and threat of rain. We were 'home free'...        The descent into Andorra-la-Veilla was cold again and I found myself having to stop a few times just because I didn't have any feelings in my fingers. There was 26 km downhill to reach the capital and I enjoyed every piece of it despite the cold. There were a few Alpine villages along the way that were really nice and also stunning views over the mountains. I was sad we were just passing by. Andorra la Veilla comes more like chaos with the heavy traffic. Jean-Francois knew where to go so I followed but I was a bit worried that the stores close and there wouldn't be anything to eat. We went to the camping he knew and all my worries and fatigue calmed down when I saw they had Pepsi in their little store! I bought 2 cans and some food for dinner. We were shown a little walk in site where many people had their tents pitched. The same cat from last year came to see Jean-Francois to his delight. An Australian travelling on a BMW touring motorcycle came and talk to us, and we had a little chat, found out he was heading for a 18 months trip back home to Australia with his motorbike... How impressive...We were invited to go to the spa in Andorra with a few of them which we declined. I would have liked to go but we were out of time and it was a bit expensive. Next time? 
We packed it up quickly but then we had a long conversations with the Australian guy from last night so we ended up leaving by 11 after a breakfast that was meant at the restaurant but it was closed, so we winged it and I had my usual fare of bread, cheese, jam and fruits. The cycling day began by a long descent down the mountain, to St-Julia and shortly after that we entered Spain. They didn't even want to see my passport at the custom, nothing. So we carried on and snapped a picture at the Spain post. We were still going down and although it was a busy road with lots of big trucks so not so restful. The views were impressive at time. It is hard to believe that you can go down for 40-50 or even 60 km but hey, it happens!        I was totally aware we were in a new country, first with the signs of the road being different, the language spoken, and also we were totally ignored by drivers where in France we would often get a thumb up or a curious eye through the window. Here, we were just nuisance on the road. At least that was my impression. I was better looking at the map better as the roads had all the same number!!! I almost took a turn off that would have taken us up the roller coaster and probably led us in Madrid through the backdoor but fortunately the vigilant eye of Jean-Francois noticed that indeed we had to carry on straight.  The panoramas were stunning, the cities totally different, it was a shock to the eye after a few weeks in France. Mountains were rocky and dry, and beside the first few cities we encountered we got to ride a good distance without any services, just the road, the trucks, some tunnels and 2 loaded bikes. We stopped in Organya for Coke, Cheetos and cupcakes. I was glad to stop, my legs didn't feel that fresh today after yesterday's climb for Andorra. The road past that point got wilder, with the wind getting in the party and stunning sceneries.       I was glad to stop for lunch, and found a caf-bar in a city called Oliana. We set up outside to have a look at the bikes and I went in to order. Oh-oh... My Spanish is very basic and I had to ask for assistance in English or French and they found someone after a few minutes. This town is not touristy it felt like we were the only foreigners around. Not only that but standing at the bar waiting I realized I was the only woman in that section, everybody else were men, and I was getting watched too! I didn't know if I was allowed in or what was the scoop. Maybe it was a custom thing for men to have a drink or coffee in the afternoon... I wanted French fries and I got them. And a salad. Oh, and Coke of course. Shortly after cycling out of Oliana we took a turn east towards Cadrona and it was that road that would take us to Barcelona the next day. I was getting well aware that my trip was just about to finish, that this was my next to last day of cycling. I didn't want my trip to end! The road to Cadrona was finally quiet, we had some peace at last. What we didn't know and the map didn't show is we had a col to climb. The Spain Michelin map is has a smaller scale than the France ones therefore not as detailed. It was really a surprise to realize that we climbed to 880 m after a good half hour of climbing.      The views were lovely up there and so was the descent in Solsona where I called another rest. I also wanted to see what a nice Spanish city looked like... This one looked fortified so it looked interesting. We did stop by an inside court, and took a breather. I was tired, and was looking forward to reach the camping some 15 km away. So said the map...         Well the camping was in fact well away from the road and we would have had to ride a dirt road for a few kilometer which wasn't appealing for 2 tired cyclists. So we decided carry on and hope for an unannounced camping in Cadrona. Cadrona came, and we noticed that we had to climb this big hill to reach town. There would be no camping there that was for sure so as the sun was getting quite low and I didn't want to carry on any farther so thought that a hotel would by needed.. I ended up having to push my bike up a narrow steep street looking for a hotel and oddly enough there wasn't any. We asked this one lady that didn't speak much English but just enough to understand hotel and led us a few blocks away to this group of people at a table. The lady spoke to this one man in Spanish and to my understanding the hotel was closed but he was willing to give us a room for 25 Euros for one night only. That was a relief to have found something. We were shown the room, and started to get everything up on the second floor. The mattresses had seen better days, and the shower was so small that even if you placed the curtain well inside you created a lake everywhere on the bathroom floor.  We showered, and went back out for dinner to this restaurant where we had good food with a pitcher of sangria.    
This morning we got up and were thankful of not having to take the tents down. We loaded the bikes and went on the lookout for something to eat for breakfast. We found some bakeries and also fruits off the street- it sounded like a market was being set up on the streets. We ate at the info center bench and Jean-Francois noticed then that he had lost one of his cycling glove. He went back where we came from and found it!  The cycling started today by a nice downhill and following a busy and especially dusty road we got to climb then descend following the moods of the landscape. I kept thinking this was the last official day riding of my trip and I had mixed emotions about it, sadness, relief, pride. I wanted to make this day enjoyable and could not wait to see Barcelona. We had a few tunnels to pass today including this very scary one that was narrow, with big semis passing, very dark and we had maybe one foot in between the side line and the broken pavement. One little mistake, to the left was busy traffic that couldn't care less about the cyclists (a few angry honks) and to the right was soft dirt and then the wall. I survived, and was relieved after that section. Jean-Francois emerged a bit later with a line up of cars kind enough to have slowed down to make him ride through safely.  We took a break and a breather at Olesa de Monserrat which is a suburb of Barcelona and we sat down on a bench in a park. Siesta for both of us gave me a little rest, some good food and off we went again. What cane was really going through cities neighboring Barcelona, and the closer we got, the worse the traffic was. A very nice mountain range got me in awe and stayed in my field of vision for an hour or 2 which was a nice distraction to the cycling, the road, the dust and the traffic. Talking of distraction, there were a few girls that were 'hitchhiking' out of nowhere, dressed 'to impress' and no, we didn't stop to say hi! Eventually after a nice drafting session for Jean-Francois, we made it close to Barcelona trying to decide on which direction to take. It was all very confusing and we were looking for a camping. the closest one happened to be by the airport and that is where we went at first. I had to use my very basic spanish to ask around in this bar where the camping was and we learned it was closed so after buying some cold treats we left for another camping by the ocean. The barman told us it would be around 10 km. I was getting tired and wanting to just be at camp, rest, have a nice shower...  We cycled and cycled, passed some campgrounds but were not the one we were looking for, watched the sun getting lower, got passed by cyclists in serious training, and just when we thought of heading back we saw this camping resort fully serviced with tennis courts, pool store and restaurants. We took it. We were given a spot behind the dump in a corner and on dusty type of dirt in the walk-in area. It was tent city and only a few feet were separating each tents. Not the best but tired like I was thought it would do. I just sat there on my thermarest drinking some beer and watching an ant colony at work, coming down a tree and heading somewhere with a serious purpose. I watched a huge tent with obnoxious people getting installed and also turning on the tv to watch the evening's programs. All I wanted was a bit of peace and quiet and I didn't even get that. Oh well. Gastronomy of the day was some macaroni and tomato sauce with lots of cheese. It would have been a nightmare to clean the pot with all the melted cheese in it but as this was the last cooking day of the trip I allowed Jean-Francois to throw away the pot he reluctantly carried all the way from Zurich. I declared that night an earplugs night and surprisingly enough I managed to fall asleep ok.
The bus ride to town was like any other bus ride except it had been weeks I ever climbed in a bus. Motion sickness was a threat but I kept busy trying to look around and absorb the sights. People watching was also very interesting as the locals were also heading to town for seemingly various reasons.  Once out of the bus, we found ourselves stepping straight into an internet cafe, and as we were in no big rush today we decided to go in and check it out. There must have been 150 terminals with flat screens in there, with a little cafe section where one could buy snacks and coffee. There was another floor with the same amount of computers. To me it was quite the sigt after a drought of many weeks without being abe to have decent internet cafes. We spent an hour in front of the screen typing stories and e-mails to loved ones and to crazyguyonabike. It made me happy but also in need of a nap afterwards... And my stomach was screaming for food, used to the high demand of energy of the last weeks.  Out of the internet cafe we headed towards the port of Barcelona in search of information for the Mallorca ferries that would reunite me with my brother. We walked in streets full of people, and should I say there was lots of stimulation for the senses, after spending weeks in quiet places. Music, people, traffic light and jams, smells of all kinds...  Huge contrast for me. We stopped and admired a cathedral surrounded by hundreds other tourists and visited the insides before heading out towards the water.       I purchased my ticket that would take me to Mallorca, and we decided to treat ourselves to a lunch before walking to the other very famous cathedral of Barcelona. It felt like things were going very fast for me now and soon enough I would be back to work in my day to day rat race life. We chose a nice restaurant and toasted to our trip...    We walked a long way to reach Gaudi's church, too much to my liking. My feet and legs were good for cycling, but then walking was a different game. I wanted to sleep, or eat more. I was on the look out for ice cream... The cathedral was very impressive to see, yet unfortunately in construction, taking away some of the awe of it all. The building had 4 towers that were going quite high in the sky, a neck twisting sightseeing, and the whole thing just looked so weird! At first it just looked like a big pile of mud. But once you get closer, and admire the details, it makes a bit more sense, and then one understands why painters and artists are too often mistaken as crazy people!           The way back got interrupted by my need for popsicles and rest my legs and then another internet session to see if anybody answered my e-mails yet! The bus ride got me motion sick and reflective about rat races that was indeed international as I people watched everybody around me in the bus. Things were starting to sink in for me as I would not have a normal day bike ride anymore on this trip, just family visiting and travel days that would eventually lead me home. There was a sense of relief getting off the bus and walking home even if "home" meant this dusty narrow noisy campground.    I tried to sleep that afternoon to no avail, then splurged in a shower and cold drinks. Tonight was restaurant night and JEan-Francois and I celebrated a month of cycling together, for the better and for worse I guess, and picked a pitcher of white sangria, made with chapagne! That was yummy but it left me quite tipsy I must admit! 
It felt weird for me being the only one to pack up but I got real focused on the task and on thinking about my route, and how I would spend the rest of my day. Breakfast got spent lingering at the camping's little cafe, sipping on hot chocolate and also remembering every day of out trip with Jean-Francois. I really enjoyed doing that as sometimes my memory fails and it made me appreciate the distance I have covered (and the altitude), the places we have seen and how fast a holiday goes when one has fun!  Noon came and for me it was time to leave. Said my goodbyes to Jean-Francois, wish him good and happy road, promised to give some news and I was on the road. I was a little worried of getting lost, like I get when I go on a trip by myself and get worried about whatever that can go wrong. But cycling the 15 km to Barcelona happened to be real fun as I was gently pushed by the wind and  averaged speeds of 32-36 km and hour. That was a blast! Getting into town got scary as I had to negociate highway conditions, on and off ramps and fast traffic but apparently bikes were legitimate on that road... I ended up in town with a relief, stopped at a fruit market for everlasting cherries and other fruits and then headed to the Art Museum that I wanted to see from up close before hitting the ferry terminal. Soon enough I was finding myself climbing a hill and looking at Barcelona from the lookout at the foot of the Art Museum's entrance. I was greeted by this middle age guy that appeared lonely, visiting Barcelona for a few days as his friends were attending an international AIDS conference. He was from Toronto and was proud to try his French on me and also enquired about stuff to do in the area as his days were empty while his friends were busy. He asked where I was heading to and whether he could also go to Mallorca for the day (!) and as he was getting a bit too nosy regarding my wearabouts I decided it was time to go and head towards the ferry terminal.       I had lots of time ahead of me and took a slow bike ride around the port, sat down and ate a full pound of cherries, wrote my journal and had some ice cream, then sat down with lunch and a good book of mine until the boat showed up. The same guy from the Art Museum decided to surprise me and come and say hi at the ferry terminal to my dismay and discomfort. He came to check out the ferry options for himself and fortunately soon enough he left... Boarding the ferry was a bit chaotic as I didn't have any direction as of where to go and what to do. I decided to leave the bike by the stairwell and climbed upstairs to find a nice comfortable spot. Now the Mediterranean sea looks quite harmless from the shore, but at sea, it's a different thing believe me! Gradually the sea got agitated and I found myself rocking with the boat.My stomach was not impressed with its contents and was threatening to send it back...  Let's say that the 3 hours of the fast ferry seemed like an eternity!  Fortunatly Mallorca showed up and the captain indeed had a good map and compass! After being all high on carbon monoxide from not being able to get out before half the cars on the ferry got out, I phoned my brother and we set a meeting point. I have been here on the island in 1996 and remembered a bit where to go but all I had to do was to follow the shore and splurge in sightseeing of docks and elegant sailing boats all along my short ride until my brother met me on his bike! That evening we went for tapas in town which happened to be really nice and then headed to sleep.   
I had coaxed my brother Michel to take me on a bike ride on the island. I wanted to go bike along the hills west coast of Mallorca and hopefully catch some good photo opportunities. We must have left by 10 or something silly like that. It was a bit late as it can get quite hot during the day here. Getting out of town was easy and soon enough we started climbing in the mountains. The surroundings were different from the mainland, drier, more olive trees, rockier. I found myself frustrated that even after 6 weeks of biking some 3500 kilometers with 65 pounds of stuff, my brother was still faster than me even if he didn't bike much anymore. Oh well... Look around Kati, appreciate the scenery, breathe!         We finally got on top of the mountain range and finally had a rolling hill-top of the crest type of terrain. The sea was bluer than blue, amazing contrast with the coast. No picture could be able to show how beautiful this was! We stopped in a village for snack and little rest and continued on the coast. It was a lot of work I should admit, hills were steep and the roller coaster was never ending! Lunch was spent eating a submarine, Mallorca way sitting on an outdoor patio, in the shade, sipping on a soft drink. Michel got tired towards the end, so he says but I don't think it showed in his performance. The last 10 km were a little hairy in the urban Palma, full of traffic and also tourist area but all went well. I was aware that this was the last bike day of my trip. The afternoon would bring me a little quiet time before it was time to go pick up the kids in daycare. I was looking forwatd to that, after seeing them in picture only. Here was Alex, 4, Ana, 2.5 and Marc,1.5 beautiful children. They were shy to me and so I was shy to them.    We headed to the large surface grocery store and daddy put them all 3 in the cart. Oh-my-god what a cultural experience... 3 kids under the age of 5, all wanting this and that, hungry and all... All of a sudden I was a bit dizzy from the extra stimuli...      We headed home after a stop in the washroom for the little lady, and a stop at the mall children ride (they all had to get on the fake horse). We got into a little crisis in the elevator when one of the kids broke the applesauce jar and got spread all over from the elevator to the hallway in the appartment. Ahhhh, the joy of kids! (Can I go back cycling now???)    Dinner was another cultural experience for me, eating with 3 hungry monsters and making the faux-pas of opening the yogourt container for the little lady creating a major crisis as she wanted to open it herself... Oooops. Appologizing didn't work in restoring the peace and one of us got big crocodile tears all over the face...     Baths were following and story reading by daddy and finally the little angels were put to rest and an amazing quietly appartment offered me the time out I needed... 
We had a whole day to enjoy the kids. We decided to go to the beach and then go see the hand gliders at play as my brother is into hand gliding up to his ears. This would be my first car trip in ages, which made me worried a bit with 3 kids in the back and my heavy history of motion sickness. Fortunately the roads were pretty straight to the north end of the island and the kids were really quiet; in fact, all three fell asleep before we made it to the beach.  We were in tourist area and it showed.. Everybody was working on their tan, there was post card alley in the commerce area and also beach items on display. The beach was crowded and after dabbing suntan lotion to everybody we found a spot to lay the towels and kids toys. The water was warm and I ended up taking each kid one at a time for a stroll in the deeper area. That was fun. I was glad to practice my role of auntie for once.  Lunch was spent at... Burger King to the delight of the kids and I am sure they enjoyed every bite of their meal. Then we had a little session on the kids coin rides. As you can see in the pictures they had a lot of fun...        Then to the hand gliding, we climbed a rugged road up a hill for an awesome panorama of the bay and there were 5 or 6 men playing with the wind up in the air. I got to think if I was hand gliding myself and being sick up there, where the vomit would land?... (Sorry that is disgusting! )    We headed back home and got crepes for dinner and then we waved goodbye to the kids as their mother came and pick them up. I wonder if they will remember me? 
The stress at the airport was whether my bike would be ok without any kind of wrapping or not. It was a chance I was taking. We had brought some tools to remove the pedals but things got a little rushed and when I handed out my bike, I left it as is, and they took it! (No wrapping, no turning out the handle bars, no removing the pedals, just deflating the tires.) I didn't pay any supplement for all my bags however they didn't have any plastic bag to put everything together so I was worried the bungee cords would not hold. I found myself hugging my brother goodbye and boarding the plane soon after... Good bye Mallorca! Well wait! It got a bit complicated at the x-ray scanner where they discovered my Swiss Army knife in my carry-on panniers among my kitchen ware. They rewinded the conveyer belt and the officer made a sign to someone else to take me in a search room. In there the man told me to get my knife out. Oh-oh. I remembered now what was going on, that I forgot to switch around some of my equipment before checking in my luggage. Well, I thought fast, and seeing the condition of my grungy pocket knife, I was more than happy to hand it out and get out of trouble, board my plane and everybody would be happy. It didn't turn out his way... The man then told me to keep my knife but not to show it in the plane... Go figure, I guess each airlines has their own safety standards. In the states I would have been in trouble and could have possibly missed my plane for that.  Well that probably means that I don't look like a terrorist, which is a good thing. The connection in Barcelona was quite short, unfortunately, so no time to linger, shop, and walk around looking at the crowd. But that meant that I would make it to Paris on time, and get reunited with my sister afer 6 weeks of biking. Orly was the landing spot this time, and as Mario and Marika were a bit late I had the chance to examine my bike for any in flight injuries or anything at all, but no! All in one piece! I inflated the tires the best I could and loaded the bike when Marika and Mario arrived and complimented me on my tan and my shape. I guess this is what 6 weeks spent outside do to you right?  Mario and I negociated the subway and the RER (regional train) the best we could with the bike and we made it home without back spasms or almost. (Paris is very unfriendly for wheelchair accessible public transportation or girl with a bike having to take the subway instead of riding the crazy roads of Paris, a real nightmare) Soon enough we were back to their appartment with the cats and good company. Afer a little nap we went back around la Seine and splurged at a trendy restaurant for French style pizza and diet coke. Oh, didn't I mention the ice cream too? :-) 
We went in town looking out for little presents for my friends, and walked miles and miles it seemed. Nothing real exciting. Just the last day in town and having a few errands to run.  We headed back home in the afternoon and splurged in a little nap, and then I got on to the task of packing it in.  We waited for Mario to come back from work and went for morrocan cuisine, couscous and merguez sausages. That was quite yummy. However like many places in Paris they think people is like sardines and they sit you so close to one another you have the neighbor's breathe (and smoke) under your nose... So that was it uh, my last day in Paris... the last day of my trip. 
We left for the train station before noon, and it involved walking to a farther train station to avoid stairs. Bought subs at the train station, which we ate on the RER (regional train). The French trains are a cultural experience. There is always musicians, entertainers, beggers coming in your wagon, playing music loud enough and close enough for you to notice real well. Then they pass the hat. I don't like that kind of sollicitation, nor the people that can't help themself and light up a joint or a cigarette in the train while you start coughing.  You can't go anywhere, you have to submit to the smoke. Vancouver is good for that, with the bylaws there are no smoking at all in the restaurants and really soon in all public spaces.  I deflated the tires at the airport, slipped on the plastic bag, removed the pedals, turned the handle bars, put some bubble wrap around the derailleurs and other sensitive spots. The panniers were attached together, the sleeping bag, tent and thermarest was put in an airport plastic bag along with my stinky cycling shoes and other items and sealed with tape. Checking in was no problem at all, the bike was handed in and so we had an hour and a half to kill before the boarding so we went sitting down, and I splurged in a Mc Donald's caramel sunday! We talked about lots of things, a real sister to sister conversation. That was very pleasant. Goodbyes were just goodbyes. This time I knew I would see her soon as she was moving back to Montreal and I would visit in the fall. So I left her to go into the tunnels towards my gate and had to wait what seemed way too much time for the metal detector/search area. That cleared, I reached the gate and noticed that the plane was not there. I didn't think too much of it as my connection in London was of 2 hours so I had time if there would be a little delay in France.  Maybe half an hour after the scheduled departure, the plane arrived, was prepped for the flight, and we boarded. Small plane, geared for short flight. Uncomfortably tight. We left the gate to park on the tarmac. Apparently we were not allowed to leave. We waited there for an hour, believe it or not. It was hot, everybody had a connection to make in London and fuming. I didn't care too much about my connection. I was just tired to wait, and wanted to have more control over my time.     Eventually the plane left Paris and France behind and I found myself running in Heathrow as my plane was scheduled to leave by now. I was told they were waiting for me so I was rushing. I managed to leave behind my helmet at a metal detector control and noticed the loss shortly before boarding. I asked a cabin steward to keep an eye on my belonging and fetched my helmet and boarded the plane that would take me home. I had thoughts for my bike, hoping it would make it all in one piece. I needed it to ride home from the airport. The plane left late too as they were recounting the number of suitcases but eventually we were up in the air. The flight was uneventful but when we passed over Greenland, a lot of people were oohhhhing and ahhhhing. I stood up and had the same feeling when I saw the mountains and icefields down below. I wish I had  taken pictures. It was awesome.  Vancouver finally came and I was glad to stretch and walk in the airport. Custom was a pain in the ass, line-ups again, and of course, I always pick the slowest lane. I waited and waited for my checked in luggages, and after half an hour, after the conveyor belt stopped working, showed up at the British Airways counter and told them all of my luggage was missing. Bike included. I also lost my luggage tickets so it would make it harder for them to trace them. It sort of bothered me that I didn't get to ride home and had to call a cab. But the worse feeling was that my bike was still in England and I was home!  I was exhausted but also excited of being home. It would take a few weeks to put things in perspective.
Riding with partners has been rewarding in some ways, like companionship, looking after one another, pushing one's physical limits and motivations and exchange of services (food for mechanics). However it has some drawbacks, like feeling you can't really do what you want to do. Having to compromise. Putting up with one aonther when time gets rough, or when the conditions are less than perfect for instance.Add to this personnalities. So either you get closer or you distance yourself...  For those of you who are wondering, I haven't had any news from Jean-Francois despite e-mails. Oh well. Each and all of us make some choices in life, and that is ok. I think I have decided to enroll in bike mechanic courses, and will stock up in a few pairs of latex gloves on my next trip. Next trip??? Yeah there will be one. Keep posted.
What I needed was something to get me going.  One day - about 6 months before my 50th birthday, I received just the motivation that I needed - an invitation to join AARP. This invitation, arriving much earlier than I expected it, was a slap in my face, and a motivator - to get me planning my cross-country trip, rather than to pass into another decade with it as a dream. The planning was kept pretty simple. My wife bought me a book about someone else's trip across the country, and I contacted Adventure Cycling, ordering the map set for the Northern Tier route. After some minor adjustments to my 5-year old hybrid bicycle (rather than working on my 20+-year old bike, or buying a new bike), I picked a date to start and made plans for a route that would take me from the Atlantic Ocean in the Boston area as far as Buffalo, NY, where I would join the AC Northern Tier route.  My route parameters were simple: follow a similar line to Buffalo as I had followed in  a trip taken 20 years before; try to intersect with as many friends along the route as possible; and divide the trip into 2 week segments to comply with my office policy to limit consecutive vacation time to two weeks.  Using the AC Northern Tier maps, I estimated that I would require about 6 two-week segments to make the full trip across the USA. Assuming that I could ride two segments each summer, I would take 3 years to finish the trip. For some reason, this all seemed reasonable to me. With tremendous support and encouragement from my wife and children, I started to make my plans more and more firm, aiming for a start date of 3 June 2000 - starting while I was still in my 50th year. This journal follows the general form of my trip.  Each chapter is a two week segment.   

The first day I managed to get a little sunburn - perhaps I did not plan quite as well as I should have?  There are so many little things that can happen on a trip, both good and bad, it is hard to plan for them all. I started my journey at about 10:30AM, dipping my back wheel in the Atlantic Ocean, down at Fisherman's Beach in Swampscott, MA. (My friend Mike Gow called the house about 9:30AM and immediately asked me why I was not on the road already.  He also gave me my mantra for the trip "Why the hell are you doing this!!")  I followed the ocean for a short while and then headed west.  I found out immediately that I was not as ready as I had hoped.  By 35 miles I was tired and ready to stop, but I plugged along to my intended campsite in Bolton.  Most of the riding was in the cities surrounding metropolitan Boston.  By the later afternoon, I had started to get into less populated towns and onto quieter roads.  The roads were generally good, with a few difficult spots (narrow roads, soft/non-existent shoulders, potholes). I rode by a high school graduation ceremony in Maynard, MA.  From a distance I could not tell what it was - a game, a flea market.  As I approached, it ended and I could see graduates coming out of the football stadium still wearing their caps and gowns.  I am sure it was a very significant event to everyone involved, but I could not tell what it was from the outside. I camped at the Crystal Spring Campground in Bolton, which was fine.  Looking in one direction, I saw a quiet stream and trees.  Turning around, I was assaulted by RV campers with kids, TVs and radios.  Apparently, this site is the summer vacation spot for people in the area, rather than renting a cabin in NH or on the Cape.         
This day had a good start - a tough middle - and a good finish.  Being Sunday, I started the day at Mass, there being a church right down the street from the campground.  After Mass, I met an older couple who gave me directions to a local diner, Michael's Bridgeside Diner, in South Lancaster.  The directions and the diner were excellent.  The road was quiet, tree-shaded and downhill.  The diner was a classic, with good food and the proper diner "atmosphere." Leaving the diner, I met a local oil-delivery man, who gave me directions to get back on my main route, Rte 62.  Unfortunately, he did not warn me that Rte 62 was a difficult bicycle route.  When I plotted the route I saw that it went through the town of Princeton and near Mt Wachusett.  What I did not realize was that Princeton was perched about 3/4s of the way up Mt Wachusett.  The hill was unridable for me - not enough lung-power or leg-power.  As the day worn on (and I wore out), I realized that I would not make my campsite in Erving, so I detoured to the town of Athol.  I arrived in Athol as a parade was going through the town, in honor of the visiting Duke of Athol, of Scotland, after whom the town is named.  I skirted the parade and rode right in front of the reviewing stand. I found a motel and finished the day slightly behind schedule and tired.  The weather forecast is for rain over the next two days.
No rain in the morning - so off I went at about 8:30AM.  I followed back roads toward Miller Falls, but became lost and wasted about 7 or 8 miles of biking, and about an hours time, until I got put back on the correct road.  My map was outdated and a segment of the road is now listed as "impassable."  I can imagine how bad it must be, because I rode some dirt roads that required me to walk some steep rutted sections.   To be "impassable," the other areas must be completely destroyed. Once back on ridable roads, the day went fine.  By 1:30 or 2:00, I was at the foot of Greenfield Mountain, which I remembered from my trip in 1977 with PJ.  It was not easy, but I was able to ride it (I had been afraid that the previous hill that required walking were setting the scene for a very difficult and disappointing trip; now it appeared that I might be able to do what I intended).  Once on top of the hill, I rode the plateau toward No Adams.  The rain held off, although it looked threatening for most of the afternoon.  The end of the road included another hill, which was tough enough, but I had forgotten a series of ups and downs before I got to the big downhill into No. Adams.  I always find those ups and downs to be draining, physically and psychologically. The downhill into No. Adams was exciting and I arrived safely at the campsite, Historic Valley Campgrounds.  Dinner was a hamburger at a stand by a baseball field, where a game had just finished.       All downhill from here! 
I started out today, thinking that the storm might stay south of me again today.  I stopped for breakfast and a little drizzle had begun.  Within a half hour it was a steady rain.  I stopped at a laundromat, read for a while and had lunch - rain, rain, rain.  I headed for a motel and called it a day. I treated myself to a nice dinner and watched the US-Ireland game from Foxborough (thanks to Anne giving me the schedule).  It rained throughout the entire game - this was a big storm.
God bless Rte 346 through Ponall, VT. As I started this morning, I stopped to take a picture of Williams College in Williamstown, and mentally prepared to ride over the mountains between me and Schenectady.  While I was stopped I chatted with an older man out walking his dog.  He recommended an alternate route, going north to Rte 346, which would take me around the mountain.  It turned out to be a wonderful route, scenic, lightly traveled and relatively flat.  The upper portion of the ride included birds (hawks and red-wing blackbirds) and flowers to distract me.  I stopped for a snack at a small restaurant outside of Troy and had a pleasant chat with an older woman.  When I resumed my ride, I found that I was already at the city limits of Troy, about 5 or 6 miles better than I had thought - a nice surprise.  As I neared Troy and Schenectady, the road was less friendly to bicycles, but I managed to arrive safely at Tom and Cheryl Della Sala's, where I had a great visit and dinner.   
The day started off overcast, but the storm had passed and I was able to ride on.  I am basically following Rte. 5, along the Erie Canal/Mohawk River.  I kept thinking that I would "push on," but I found I was tired by the time I reached the KOA at Herkimer, and I crashed for the night.  The campground is nice, with a stream running behind my tenting area. I treated myself to a nice meal at a restaurant across the street, and saw a high school awards night being held in one of the function rooms.
The day's ride was tiring again, with the heat and rolling terrain.  If I had the time, I would take a short day or two, but I am trying to keep on schedule.  At least the area is pretty and the road is relatively smooth and traffic free.  I see quite a lot of animal life - a deer standing by the road watching me go by, rabbits and bunnies, and other unknowns rustling in the brush by the road.  I also see a fair amount of roadkill - skunks, raccoons, birds and turtles. I camped at the Green Lakes State Park, which is lovely, and includes a public golf course designed by Bobby Jones, with a clubhouse that serves pretty good pub-style meals.  Unfortunately a school group arrived at the campsite, adding to the noise level.  Then at about 3AM I had to get up and chase a raccoon away from the food on my bike.
Another hot day of rolling hills.  Today I rode through Syracuse, and it took me at least an hour to navigate the city traffic with stop lights and all. My plans were to rendezvous with an old friend, Larry Zimmer and spend the night at his home.  With the rolling hills, headwind and heat, I faded fast.  When I stopped at 2PM for food, I called Larry, and he just asked, "Where are you?  I'll come and get you."  About an hour or so later, I was struggling along, head down, melting in the heat.  I looked up and there was Larry standing by the side of the road, leaning against his car.  He was a beautiful sight to behold!  We loaded my bags into his car and he drove on about 10 miles into Seneca Falls, and I rode in on my bike (having some initial problems because my front wheel was so light).  It was nice to get off my bike. Larry gave me a ride to his home on a hill with a great view of Keuka Lake, one of the Finger lakes - it is a beautiful spot.  He and his wife gave me a great meal, pleasant company and a soft bed - perfect.     
Today was a good day.  Larry gave me a ride to another friend's lakeside cottage (Mike Gow).  There Mike and his wife loaded bikes in their car and drove me back to my stopping point in Seneca Falls.  Mike and I then had a delightful ride to his home in Mendon.  He knew the back country roads and he was a great riding companion. The day ended with rain for the last few miles, but a hot shower cured everything. The Gows have a beautiful home and they are wonderful hosts.  After showers and a beer, we went to visit another friend who had been battling cancer during the past year.  Dinner was a wonderful lasagna - sleep was in another soft bed - this bike touring can be pretty wonderful stuff!!
The riding was good today - a few hills but nothing too bad.  At one point, the wind was at my back, and I was going 18 MPH on a nice flat section of road.   Staying at a nice campground, but the ground is very wet,  When I talked with Anne and with Dawn Northwood, I found it had rained much of the day in Boston and in Buffalo.  I didn't realize how lucky I had been. Anne told me that she had heard from PJ, who was cutting his ride across the USA short because of a fall coming out of the Rockies.  I talked with him and he is OK, but disappointed
It took me about 5 hours to cover 25 miles because of passing rain storms and the usual city delays in Buffalo.  Within the city, I was riding on the sidewalk because the edge of the road did not allow safe travel for cars and bikes.  As I was riding along, a truck went by and splashed water all over me - it was as if an ocean wave had broken over me. At breakfast, I had a nice chat with an older couple who used to ride a tandem together.  At lunch, a local barber stopped and asked if I needed email access.  Evidently he had a computer in his shop down the street.  Nice offer, but I was within an hour of the end of the trip, so I continued on. I had a great visit with the Northwood family in Buffalo, the end of my first trip segment.
The ride was comfortable, but made for a long day, convincing me that I should fly back to Buffalo when I start segment 2.  Looking out the window, it was funny to realize that I reversing the efforts of the past 11 days.  Many times I had looked over the distance to see a passing train, wishing I were on the train.  Now I am on the train, realizing that travel by bicycle has some nice advantages - especially the chance to see the country up close, and the opportunity to meet people along the way. A cute blond meets me at the train station - it is great to be home!
Anne and my daughters, Emily and Hannah saw me to my flight from Hanscom Field to Buffalo, NY.   Met by Dawn Northwood after an "interesting" flight.  Delayed at the beginning to replace the radar, we flew through thunderstorms to arrive in Buffalo.  The radar provided the pilot with the proper view of the weather to avoid it all.  There were a few uncertain moments as the pilot explained several times that we would probably experience pretty serious turbulence, but that the plane was very sturdy and he had flown since the days of the DC-9 and was confident.  His constant reassurance convinced me we were is for a bad ride, but we were lucky and had no bumps at all. Sad news about an old friend.  His leukemia had recurred and he had died over the 4th of July weekend.   
A good day to start my trip.  Unfortunately, as I was packing, I grabbed one of the Adventure Cycle maps for the wrong section of the ride.  Fortunately, Ed had a map of the Buffalo area to get me onto Route 5, which is the main road to follow for a while, joining Rte 62 later on.  All went well until I approached the turn for Rte 62.  When I stopped at a gas station for directions, I met a guy traveling the same route as I am, and he had the correct AC map.  He helped me find my route for the day, and I was on my way - it pays to be lucky! As I was riding along, I noticed a parallel road closer to Lake Erie.  I detoured and found a small park area, where I stopped for a rest.  I chatted with a man and his grandchildren.  Evidently this was their private park and he was surprised that I had found it - but very glad to share it with me.  He also advised that my original stopping place, Dunkirk, NY was only about 10 miles away (at 2PM), and that I could get to a nice campground in Westfield, in about 25 miles.  I took his advice and did push on to Westfield, arriving tired but satisfied. I had a nice visit with a couple in an RV near my campsite, they were headed back to Long Island after a nice vacation. I popped a rivit on my front pannier, but I was able to fix it and re-attach the hook that hold the bag on the bike rack, using little plastic ties. The campground was close to the NY turnpike, so it was a little noisy, making for interupted sleep.     
Conneaut is pronounced "con - ee-ought."  Another nice day for riding.  I passed through parts of NY, PA and OH..  Compared to the MA and NY segment, this segment is flat.  While riding along, I passed some interesting farms - one had a list of everyone in the family who had attended Penn State. Going in the other direction, I started to see groups of riders.  Finally, I yelled over to one group and found they were a van-supported tour going from San Francisco to New Hampshire.  I was envious of their ease of travel. While riding I felt my thigh muscle tighten up - nothing like a muscle pull with 440 miles to go on the trip. Passing into Ohio, the road lost its shoulder - I hope that is not a presage of things to come. Camping in a site by the turnpike again tonight       
A great day, I was able to pickup the missing map at the PO in Ashtabula, OH.  The riding was great and the weather was super. While riding from Mentor to Willowich, I passed about 8 miles of stop-and-go traffic.  I was the fastest moving vehicle in either direction.  For a portion I even had a separate bike lane.  (I found out later that there had been an explosion at a gas plant by the turnpike, causing the turnpike to be closed and shunting all traffic onto side roads like the one I was riding.) I stopped in a motel about 10 miles east of Cleveland.  While it was comfortable, it looked a little seedy and I am afraid I did not sleep well.   
(Vermillion is named after the local red clay, which the Indians used for paint.) The ride today never seemed to get going.  The morning ride was through Cleveland - city riding is always slow for me - and I can feel the bike and equipment jar on each bump in the road.  The towns west of Cleveland are continuous suburbs of Cleveland so there is little "open road' to ride.  I find Ohio to be schizophrenic about bicycles - sometimes providing nice little bike paths and other times forcing you to ride on the sidewalk - with a one inch bump at each intersection - definitely not wheelchair corners. My leg is much better, though.  I bought some Sport Crme and it makes a big difference. During one of my stops, I had a nice talk with two people, at a gas station.  We were talking about distance biking and they said that they often see a portion of an American Lung Society ride - about 500 people riding West to East.  A woman added a comment about her son living in the Boston area (Bridgewater, actually). I did laundry today, and the woman at the laundromat talked about a couple that had stopped to do laundry two days ago - perhaps they were part of the West-to-East group who passed me the other day. Going out of Cleveland heading west, I began to go through some lovely suburban communities, and had some great lakeside views.  At lunchtime, I met a guy who stopped to talk about his plans to ride a century soon (on his own if I understood him correctly).  He currently does triathlons and was excited to talk about a long bike ride.  It was good to see someone else who was excited by my trip - it picked me up. The day has ended very nicely.  I am staying at a campground by Lake Erie.  I went for a swim in the lake earlier and I am now sitting on a rock quay watching the sun go down.   Later in the evening I went into a local bar and watched some baseball and had some interesting talk with the locals, including a young woman who wanted me to stay and chat (which her male companion did not seem to want), and a fellow who wanted to know whether he had made a good deal on a bike he just bought (and planned to ride home later - in the very dark of night, with more than a few beers in him).  I escaped unscathed, and retreated to my tent. Hopefully the next few days will go well - there is the threat of rain and I am leaving the AC route as I head toward Chicago.   
The wind was in my face for much of the day, and I am now in an area that is laid out like a checkerboard, with long, straight, flat roads running East-West and North-South.  Stecker Road runs East-West for about 12 miles - with a headwind the whole way.  Occasionally, the corn fields are high enough to block some wind, but open fields let the wind come right at you and make for tough riding.  Because the road was so long and unchanging, I decided to call home and bring Anne out onto the road.  Fortunately she was home and we had a nice chat, as I rode along.  Now we can say she has been on the road with me! I met another cross biker - Don Cockman, a retired Englishman, who is making his third crossing (first time alone).  We saw each other as we approached, so we both slowed down and had a nice visit for 20 minutes or so.  He is hoping to make Bar Harbor, ME and then bicycle down to Boston, MA for his flight home, by mid-August.  I invited him to visit on his way, as the most likely route he would follow into Boston passes within 1/2 mile of my home.  (He did indeed stop and visit for several days, and we gave him a ride into the airport.) Between Clyde, OH and Fremont, OH there is a bike path that is 6.5 miles long.  It was great (except for the headwind), providing a smooth, paved surface and no traffic - a great break from the road. As I exited the bile path and got back on the road, two rear spokes popped.  Fortunately, the town had a bike shop.  I called, got directions and they took me right in and fixed me up.  Great service. My legs are tired and sore by the end of the day.  I expect the constant stress of 65 to 80 miles per day are tougher than I expected - maybe I will take a short day tomorrow.
(Bryan, OH is the home of Ohio Art - the maker of Etch-a-Sketch.) Today was a nice day, good weather, good roads, and no problems.  I stopped in Grand Rapids, which is a small town on the Maumee River, with a lovely river walk park in its downtown area.  I had a nice chat with two men who were driving through the area, but nothing remarkable.
I reached the 1,000 milestone for my trip today! Finally, a day with very little wind - and what there was, was at my back.  To my surprise, the area of Indiana in which I am riding is similar to New England - with forests and rolling hills.  The forests are not as extensive as the New England forests and the types of trees appear to be different, but there is a similar feel as you ride through the area.  Fortunately, the hills are less steep and not as high as the hills I encountered in New England. My route joined US Rte 20, which concerned me because I know it can be a heavily trafficked road.  Fortunately, I joined the road at a spot where the road had been resurfaced, with a full shoulder in excellent condition! - all the way to La Grange (about 15 or 20 miles).   As I was riding along this new road, I was amazed that there were so many bicycle tire marks on the shoulder area.  There was also an unusual chipped look in the middle of the shoulder lane - between the tire marks.  After about  a half hour, the appearance of several piles of horse poop, and a particularly clear signpost, I finally realized that I was seeing the marks of horse-drawn carriages - I was in an area with a large Amish/Mennonite population. I stayed in a pricey campground - big, but not worth it to an itinerant like me.
I rode about 10 miles this morning before stopping for breakfast in Shipshewana, at a nice Amish restaurant.  Amish/Mennonite carriages are commonplace in Shipshewana, but I felt a little invasive when I considered taking pictures.  As I was riding out of town I decided that they are certainly a special part of the area and I should have at least one picture.  I prepared to photograph the next carriage that approached.  As the carriage approached, the driver, an older woman took out her whip and sped up to get by me - evidently she considered the picture invasive, as well.   I took two shots anyway.  I rode on through Middlebury, which was another beautiful town, with a large Amish/Mennonite influence. The rest of the day was delightful - the wind was at my back for most of the time, the roads were good and the weather was nice for riding.  Using my map and local directions, I was able to pick a nice route (County Route 36 and New Road) which gave me about 30 miles of good riding.  New Road (amusingly enough) even had a section of fresh roadway - so fresh, that I saw the roller finishing one end of it. This has been a great section of my trip. La Porte is a middle sized city that looks a little tired.  I stayed in a non-descript motel and ate at a mediocre family restaurant. I called ahead to make arrangement to meet Walt, my college roommate and host in Chicago.  Plans to meet for a short ride on the last day are still uncertain, even though tomorrow is the last day.   
The final day of riding in this segment was very nice.  The weather and road conditions were fine. As an added treat, the first part of the day involved a 30 mile ride to the Indiana Dunes National Park, a beautiful beach area on the lake.  I had estimated the distance at 50 miles, so I felt great when I was at the Park much sooner than I had expected.  Also, the county roads were good riding.  I only ran into about a 1 mile stretch of dirt/gravel, just before I arrived in the Park area. The second part of the ride was into and through Gary, IN and Chicago, IL, which was pretty typical city riding.  Busy streets - glass on the roadway - and delays because of a flat tire right outside of a steel plant in Gary.  A bit of a silver lining - two people stopped to see if I needed any help.  It was encouraging to see that people still look out for one another.  Fortunately, I successfully located and patched the puncture - so far only two flat tires, and two successful patchings. As it turns out, Walt was not able to ride into Chicago with me, but the ride eventually accessed a nice bikeway by Lake Michigan.  There were several beautiful views of Chicago as the bikeway wended its way along the lake shore.       
I had several days to visit in Chicago and saw quite a bit: riding by the lake, I saw a noontime jazz concert; I went to the Field Museum; saw a baseball game (Cubs at Wrigley Field); swam in Lake Michigan; had dinner with friends; and had a great time with my college roommate and his family. I flew home on July 29 and was glad to be back with my family again.     
Walt and I took a ride around Chicago and then I loaded everything back on the bike and was ready to go   
Walt and Alycia had breakfast with me and saw me on my way.  (Walt was heading off to play golf.)  It took me about 20 minutes to have my first mishap.  On an early Sunday morning I did not expect to see many people around (and I did not).  However, someone swung a door open on a parked car, and hit one of my front panniers, snapping the holding hook off.  I was able to do some roadside repair and was back on the road in 15 or 20 minutes.  It took me about two hours to clear the city and about four hours before I began seeing fields and birds (cardinals) and chipmunks. Outside of Chicago, I got onto the Illinois Prairie Path (a bike path) and the Geneva Spur.  The combined distance was about 20 miles and I was glad that I was able to follow the bike path for so long.   After the bike path, I began to follow Rte 38, which was my original route of choice.  As it turned out, Rte 38 was not a very bikeable road - it was busy and congested.  As a pleasant surprise, Walt was waiting along the side of the road, near where I had joined Rte 38.  He had decided to drive out Rte 38 after his golf match to see if he could catch me.  He had just decided to turn around when he saw me riding along.  It was good fortune because I had just gotten on Rte 38 about a mile earlier, having just come off the bike path.  It was great to see Walt - a boost to the day. At dinner, I overheard the people at the next table talking about riding a Century that day.  I interrupted and asked about possible routes west, and they gave me a suggestion, which required that I buy a local map book, but gave me a much better route to ride than I had planned on my own.  As in the past, local advice is good to get.           
Because I had heard that tomorrow should be rainy, I tried to push a little farther today, and was able to ride a hundred miles and reach the Mississippi River.  This day had everything.  The riding conditions went from great to grit.  Based on the advice of the people the previous evening, I was able to ride on back roads most of the way, but the roads turned to gravel on two occasions, the last including a hill that I had trouble walking up.  After that segment, I rode some rolling hills that took me from 32 miles per hour to 3.2 miles per hour.  Finally, I waved down a UPS truck to see if I had taken any wrong turns.  Knowing from my map that the road could be either Scenic Palisades Road or Scenic Georgetown Road, I asked which road I was on.  He said it is sometimes called both.  However, he did assure me that if I proceeded another couple of miles, I would be in Savanna - very good news.  (By the way, the next street sign I saw said that I was on Scenic Bluff Road - go figure.) Dinner and a bed were welcome tonight - rain is still forecast for tomorrow.   
I found that the Gideon Bible in my room had Psalm 14 and Psalm 53 appearing to be the same Psalm.
The early ride was very nice, once I crossed the Mississippi River, on an open grate bridge with two very narrow lanes, for two-way traffic.  Fortunately, I had an early start and had beat the traffic out of Savanna.  After the bridge, the road was great, the surface was pretty smooth, there was a shoulder and the traffic was not bad.  After a while, it began to get hilly and there were several hills that I had to grind over in my lowest gear, for up to a mile!  There were a couple of hill before I arrived in Dubuque, IA, which seemed like a nice little city on the river.  As I was biking through town, I met a local biker, Mike Hogan, who is a retired phone company worker.  He rode with me out of Dubuque for a few miles and proved to be a pleasant companion.  He said that he usually biked about 4,000 miles a year, but had to be a little careful since he had had a heart attack a couple of years ago, at 55.  Before we went our separate ways, he previewed the route for the next 30 miles or so - pretty, but hilly, and he was right.  He also assured me that I would be able to find a motel in Guttenberg, which was good to know. He was correct about the hills, there were several, but the ride along the river is beautiful in many spots.  One interesting site, although not exactly beautiful, came as I was riding up one hill. I came around a corner and saw a turkey vulture eating a dead rabbit in the middle of the road. I pushed on to Guttenberg and found a nice, inexpensive motel.  Guttenberg is a lovely town on the river.  It is only about 3 blocks deep, but has a nice road along the river, with a lock, which I always love to see.     
While I had foolishly expected Iowa to be flat and full of cornfields, I was learning that the land along the Mississippi is all hills and valleys.  The ride out of Guttenberg was interesting, starting out in fog by the river, I climbed a hill to leave the city, climbing out of the fog into beautiful sunshine.  The hills were hard for me between Guttenberg and Harper's Ferry and on into Lancaster.  In one 5-mile stretch, I had to climb two 1-mile long hills, in my lowest gear, which means I was going about 3.6 miles per hour.  Fortunately the downhills allow me to go fast enough that my average speed stays about 10 miles per hour.  Finally, the steeper hills seemed to be behind me, and I started riding on Rte 26, which had traffic, but also provided a wide shoulder (and seemed to follow a route that avoided the bigger hills).  On this road, I rode out of Iowa and into Minnesota. The route was more forgiving and I was able to spot some bald eagles soaring out over the river.  I saw a few live deer along this part of the route, and I "heard" turkey vultures taking off from trees by the road.  (As near as I can tell, the birds I saw just drop out of the tree they are in and fall through the branches to reach the proper speed to fly.  I could hear them crashing through the branches, and then I would see them fly out of the trees and rise up into the sky.  It was a nice humorous break in the routine.) When I arrived at my planned campsite in LaCrescent, I found that it was set up for RVs, and did not provide warm showers.  Being addicted to a shower at the end of the day, I pushed on into LaCrescent itself, about 10 more miles, and found the Ranch Motel, which was fine, and inexpensive.   I checked email today and did laundry.         
Stopped in Wabasha about 2PM, after about 65 miles.  Sat by the river and had lunch and cooled down.  Trying to call ahead to Lake City for a place to stay at night, I had to use AT&T because I was outside of the NEXTEL network.  Riding on toward Lake City, I stopped at a pretty overview area, to admire the view and to take another break.  While I was taking a picture of a historical marker, I heard screeching behind me and turned in time to see a sparking boat and trailer go by on the other side of the road, coming to a flaming stop about 100 yards down the road.  The trailer was followed by a logging truck that stopped about 200 yards down the road.  In front of me was a pickup truck with some blown tires.  Evidently the logging truck had run into the trailer, which had been attached to the pickup truck.  I was very happy that I had not been on the road when the accident occurred.  I was wary for the rest of my ride that day, which was less than two hours, thank God. Lake City claims to be the birthplace of the water ski.  There was a great campground run by the city, which was a good end to a hot and tiring day.  I was glad to get in some camping - the air was great and I was within hearing distance of the shore - a nice, lulling sound.
Hills again on a long, hot day!!  Why am I doing this trip again? Much of today was lost in a heat/hill-induced haze as I decided to push on to Osceola.  Of interest to me as I was leaving Lake City, I did notice a very large turtle by the side of the road.  On closer inspection, I decided that it had dug a nest in the sand by the road and was laying eggs.  A few hundred yards away was a pond/inlet from which it had come, I assume.  A nice sight and a reminder of how much more you can see when you slow down.  I spotted several lovely towns along the way, particularly Stillwater, MN, which was having a festival weekend.  It looked like a great place and I am sorry that I did not stop for more than a water break.  But, the distance was about 60 miles and I wanted to try to get in some more (which actually meant pushing on for 35 miles into Osceola). I crossed the Mississippi River coming out of Stillwater on a very bicycle unfriendly bridge - a narrow, busy roadway, with a mediocre sidewalk alternative.  As soon as I got off the bridge, I took my first right (following the AC map directions).  This turn put me on County Route E, "E" for "Egad, this hill is vertical!!"  After a difficult 1/4 mile walk up this hill, the route leveled out and was pretty good for a while.  I was getting so tired by the time I ran into another hill that I needed to walk.  After that hill, the road finally settled down and I made it into Osceola for the night. Dinner was good - sleep was better.   
Finally, I have made the turn toward the West - and flatter land.  There was rain in the morning, so I had to delay my start.  The day became hot, the wind was mostly in my face - and it took a long time to get where I wanted to go.  After I decided to go as far as Milaca, I called ahead to make sure that one of the two listed motels would have space for me (there being no campgrounds listed in the area).  The Super 8 Motel said that it was full - no vacancies.  The other motel had an answering machine.  Nervously, I arrived in Milaca and checked at the Super 8.  There was a dog show in town and the motel was indeed full.  I asked about the other motel and was told it was a little place and I got the impression that it was less than a reputable place.  When I arrived at the motel, there was a sign at the desk saying come back a 8PM.  I saw a woman drive up and check herself in (having made previous arrangements) so that I knew the place was open, at least. I went off to dinner, after leaving a note on the check-in desk.  While I was eating, a woman came into the sandwich shop, looked at me and asked if I was the biker looking for a motel room.  I said "Yes" and she said she and her husband ran the place and he was at the motel - and they did have a room (Thank God!). It turned out the motel was fine - clean, quiet, comfortable and inexpensive.  I have no idea why the clerk at the Super 8 was so strange about the place.
Today was full of everything.  The riding was great, cool wind at my back and level roads!  By 12:30PM, I had logged 60 miles - but I had been watching thunderstorms move in, first to the North and then filling from the Southwest.  I caught a little rain coming into Little Falls and saw some large, close lighting bolts.  I pulled into a restaurant for lunch, just as a hail storm broke.  After lunch I headed for a motel in town and settled in to weather the storms.  I did laundry and went to the local library to catch up on email.  While I was in the library, lightning strikes knocked out power two or three times.  Finally there was a break and I was able to take a short tour of the town - the park by the falls was lovely.  Then it was back to my room for a good night's sleep.   
Today was a near perfect day - sun, 70 degrees, wind at my back, and riding companions for a couple of fast-paced hours. While I was having lunch in the RK Cafe, I saw a bike rider come in for a phone call.  We chatted briefly - his name was Jim and he was traveling from Pittsburgh to Seattle with five college friends.  As I wanted to ride enough miles today to make Fargo by tomorrow, I declined an invitation to meet the group at the local park, and we went our separate ways. A few miles outside of town, I stopped for a bathroom break at a local general store.  As luck would have it, when I came out of the store, Jim and his friends were pulling in.  They had seen my bike and stopped to say "hi."  We rode on together toward Battle Creek.  It was a pleasant time - they were very personable riding companions, and they made the time pass quickly, and kept a nice fast pace, for me.  They were all college-age and were traveling on the cheap - staying on town greens or in people's yards/garages/etc.  They were building up a collection of great stories. We separated in Battle Creek where they were taking a break to swim in the lake.  They had explained to me that they tended to ride at a moderately fast rate, but to take long breaks, so their progress was less than they hoped for on some days.  I went on to Amor and stayed at a lovely B&B called "Aloft in the Pines."  It was a nice home on a lake, and I had the place to myself, only overlapping with the proprietress when I arrived, as she and her husband had evening plans and left for work early in the morning.  In the evening, it was great to sit in a screened porch and watch hummingbirds come to feeders in the yard. I had called the Fargo bike shop before I finished the ride today.  They are still ready for me, and I have a good shot at making Fargo tomorrow.   
The final day for this segment of the trip. After a very comfortable sleep at the B&B, I awoke to the sound of rain falling at 7:15AM.  I took my time getting organized and ready to ride again because the forecast was for gradual clearing.  By 9:15 I was ready and the rain had stopped.  Even though it was still overcast, I decided to start the day.  As I rode toward Fargo, the clouds became more distinct and began to show occasional breaks.  Finally, the sun was out and the wind was filling from the east.  This was a day on which I could feel myself riding fast.  At one time I looked down and saw that I was going 22 MPH, a good combination of a flat, straight road, and a good wind at my back. I followed the alternate route suggested by Tom at the bike shop in Fargo.  It turned out to be a very nice route - a great finish to the ride.  As I neared Fargo, the rain clouds began to gather.  I met a biker named Jim, who was headed back into Fargo, and guided me through the local streets.  He was an airline pilot and knew the group at Island Park Cycle.  I rode into Fargo and found the bike shop, the train station and the motel.  The riding portion of another stage is done - now for the trip home.     
Today I dropped my bike at IPC and hung out in Fargo.  I caught the 2AM train to Minneapolis

The two-day travel plans for my return to Boston was too much down time.  I don't think that I will do that again, even if it gets more expensive.
I need to make arrangements for leaving my bike somewhere over the winter.  It is difficult to estimate how far I will be able to ride, allow for weather delays, and still end up in a town that is near an airport and has a bike shop (or some other place to store my bike).   My guiding principal is to plan as best as I can, but rely on a little luck to help it all work out. I have heard back from the Havre Bicycle Center, and they will store my bike for the winter (thank you!).   
After an uneventful flight though Minneapolis, I arrived in Fargo, ND.  There was a big wind/rain storm passing through and I overheard the pilot comment that if we had been five minutes later, we would not have been able to land. I settled into a motel, picked up my bike and prepared for the next two weeks of cycling.   
  
I had a nice chat with the locals at one of the bars.  The people are very friendly, there just are not many of them around. Also, these people are familiar with the bicycle route I am following and have stories about previous cyclists passing through.  Some of the cafes have books to sign, or maps to place a pin in your hometown.   
A quiet day on the road - just me, the hawks, the frogs and the snakes.
The beginning of my ride was great, a light tailwind and cloud cover to keep the temperature down.  I reached Rugby, ND (the geographical center of North America) about 12:30PM.  I stopped for pictures and food and water before heading on to Towner (tow - ner), which was about 25 Miles away.  I considered pushing on to Minot if the tailwind held.  As I left Rugby, I was on a four-lane divided highway.  About two miles down the road, I saw another bike traveler, unfortunately we were on opposite sides of the divided highway, so we merely waved and kept going our separate ways. By Towner, the wind had swung into the South, but was not a problem, so I decided to push for Minot.  As luck would have it, the wind became a lot stronger, so even a crosswind was tiresome.  Then the cloud cover cleared and the sun beat down on me.  While I had plenty of water, the water itself got so hot that it was not refreshing me at all.  I had about 22 miles to the next town (Granville), so I just plodded along.  I saw more tumbleweeds b;ow across the road.  When I arrived in Granville, I found out that the campground did not have showers, so I decided to continue on and make Minot before sundown.  Minot would have motels and showers and beds - a real incentive.  About 10 or 15 miles outside of Minot, the wind swung from the South, into the West (a headwind), and then into the North.  When the wind swung into the North, the temperature dropped about 15 degrees.  I could breathe again, and was able to finish the day's ride with a little more strength.  (I heard later that Minot set a record for the temperature on the date - 104 degrees.) After dinner, I saw the skies lighting up with lightning - very impressive.  It looked like that scene in "Close Encounters of the Third Kind" when the space ship arrives in an approaching thunderstorm.   
Minot has the first library I have seen on the trip, so I have taken advantage of computer access, as well.  I am not sure what access will exist during the rest of my trip.
The land is beautiful, the rolling hills remind me of the way the West was portrayed in the old Westerns.  It makes me want to ride off on a horse.  My experience with horses has always been poor - so this desire is not natural. New Town was created from two separate towns in the 1950s, when they dammed the Missouri River in this area, flooding the two towns.  The town is in the Fort Berthold Reservation and the facilities are not luxurious.  However, the motel was adequate, and gave me a warm place on a night with temperatures in the lower 40s.  If the night temperatures stay low, I think I will be using motels more than camping over the next week.   
"The bear went over the mountain, the bear went over the  mountain, the bear went over the mountain, and what do  you think he saw.   He saw another mountain, he saw another  mountain, he saw another mountain, and what do you think  he did.   The bear went over the mountain, the bear...." It seemed as if I was that bear today. There was nothing to look at except the scenery, which again was lovely.  As I have noticed during my ride in North Dakota, people driving by are very likely to wave as they pass.  I think that they realize that there is no other human contact because there is nothing on the side roads that I am using. I am staying in a very nice motel that provides a computer in the lobby.   Tomorrow I cross into Montana - the mountain time zone.   
I had planned on a short day, taking an easy breakfast and going to church (doesn't hurt to have God on your side).  I thought it would be an easy day, but a combination of the wind and some small hills made it a more difficult ride than I anticipated. I did meet two men who were riding from Bremerton, WA to Devils Lake, ND.  When we met, I had come 30 miles from Williston (their destination for the day), and they had come 50 miles (from Poplar).  I just didn't feel as if I had 50 miles in me, so I decided to cut the day at Culbertson. I stopped at the Culbertson Museum, which gave an interesting (eclectic) view of the area.  Two older women were the curators/guides, and the museum is an odd collection of things from people's attics and barns, mixed with some items people have been collecting for years.  It ranges from historical to hysterical.  It was a very nice break,   
At Wolf Point, I did laundry, and stopped at a Post Office to mail my camping gear home.  The nights are too cold for me to be sleeping comfortably on the ground, and the weight is just an extra burden now. Today, I had an interesting experience.  I was riding on a side road, which is parallel to Route 2 (the main road across northern MT).  I was riding a nice flat road, with the wind at my back, and about 10 miles of clear road ahead.  I was wondering about this lone house by the side of the road, when I heard and quickly saw a pack of about 6 or 7 dogs racing from the house toward the road - and me!  Thank god I was on a flat road with the wind at my back.  By the time I passed the driveway break in the fence (through which poured the dogs), I was going about 20 MPH.  The largest dog, a german shepard, chased me for about a quarter of a mile, but seemed to lose heart when we reached about 24 MPH.  Needless to say, my heart was pumping from the exertion and the fear of being eaten. Wolf Point is on the Fort Peck Indian Reservation, and is a city of some size, for the area.  It is a little run down, but nice enough.  It has a pleasant little park area, with a gazebo, where I sat and read while my laundry was washing.  In front of the gazebo there is a plaque explaining that the gazebo is a reconstruction of one from 1917.  The reconstruction was provided by the son of a couple that settled in the area in 1915, before there were roads, water, electricity, or phones.  The plaque goes on to say that the ranch that they established is still owned by members of the family - and that this couple helped to bring civilization to the area (I can't help but think that some of the reservation Indians might take offense at this plaque, although there were no signs of vandalism.)   
The highlight of the day was lunch at "Bergie's" in Nashua, MT.  The place boasts a soda fountain which has been in the town since 1932.  It was nice to talk to some people, also.
Another beautiful riding day.  The tailwind was strong all day, which allowed me to stop and read the historic markers along the route and to take food breaks, while finishing 75 miles by 3PM. Talking to people today, it is incredible how many people in Montana have relatives in NYC or Wash DC, showing the wide reach of the attacks yesterday.   
Again, the day is beautiful.  Montana weather seems to start each day a little cloudy and cool, with the sun burning through by mid-morning.  I have been very lucky that there is a low pressure area passing south of me and giving me strong winds from the East.  If it had been a high pressure area, I would have fought headwinds.  A couple of times in the past two days, I have ridden back on the road for one thing or another.  When I turned and headed East, the wind would drop my speed by 3 or 4 miles per hour, and cause me to increase my effort.  I am ever thankful for tailwinds.
I dropped my bike at the Havre Bicycle Center and had a nice talk with Roger, the owner.  He is planning a ride of the Southern Tier route, with his son this Fall.  He said he would take good care of the bike and would see me in the summer. My trip home begins tomorrow morning and I hope all goes smoothly.     
The flight home did go well indeed.  I had re-routed to arrive in Providence, RI rather than risk problems/delays at Boston.  Fortunately my family was able to make the connection in Providence and we had a very happy reunion when I arrived.  Glad to be home!
I will try to stop by monthly to make notes on my progress. 6 March 2002 Well, I am still struggling with my training schedule, although I have established an indoor area for an exercycle and NordicTrak ski machine and have been able to start logging in about 90 minutes on weekend days and 45 minutes of several week nights each week.  The weather broke for one Saturday and I was able to ride for about two hours, including a route with some gentle hills. 29 April 2002 I have finally been able to settle into a routine of riding outside.  For the past several weekends, I have been able to ride 30 or 40 miles on Saturday and/or Sunday, and I have begun bicycling a portion of my daily commute, adding about 14 miles each weekday. 28 May 2002 For the past few weeks, I have been commuting to work, roughly 30 miles per day, roundtrip.  I feel that I am in as good or better shape for this portion of the ride as I was for previous portions.  I have two more weeks to get it all together, so I intend to spend my evenings getting all of the information I need into travel format.  This time is the antsy time, when you are mentally getting on your way, before you can actually start - a nerve racking time.
When I checked my bag through to Havre, MT, the agent in Boston commented that this was the first time that she had ever checked anything or anyone to Havre, MT. The flights were fine and everything arrived as planned.  My bike was ready and I am re-loading the bags, ready to start the last part of this journey tomorrow.
Today was a good beginning.  The wind pushed me so that 100 miles felt like 70.  The rain held off for most of the morning, which helped.  Unluckily, I did have to negotiate two muddy sections - as described by a local woman as "6 miles of the worst mud you will ever see, I dont know how you will get by."  Fortunately, one of the muddy sections had an unused side that I could ride - gravel but not too bad.  The next muddy section was completely unrideable and I had to do some off-road riding. The rest of the riding day was wet and cold, but I reached Shelby and a nice motel. Already I have seen several live deer running through fields by the road.  You don't have to go far out of Havre to get into the rural parts of Montana.     
After about an hour of riding, the day settles into a steady rain - a cold, steady rain. I had planned to ride to East Glacier, but in Cut Bank when I stopped for some food and to warm up, I was told by a couple that they had just come from East Glacier, which had no power and was sending all of its guests away.  I called forward to Browning, the town I would reach before East Glacier and I was told they had power and were open for guests. I pushed on. The day was just a wet, cold ride, culminating in a final 5 mile section, during which I rode into an increasing wind along fields covered with about 5 inches of snow.  I found out later that the wind chill factor was about 27 degrees F.  My fingers and toes were well aware of the chilling combination.  (It took me about 10 minutes to warm up enough to sign in at the hotel at the end of the day.) While I was warming up and waiting to register in the hotel, I chatted with fellow guests including a returning local who preferred to refer to me as a crazy whhite guy on a bike - to distinguish me from the locals on the reservation.  The other person I met was a man from California, Dan Potash, who had grown up "back East".  When I said I was from the Boston area, he said he grew up just north of Boston, in a small coastal town called Swampscott, which is the town where I started this journey - talk about your small world!   

Today was a great day.  While it looked a little threatening and many advised that the pass would not be great for a bicycle, I took the advice of some electric power workers and headed along (Boredom comes fast in the town of Browning). The ride was great.  I reached Marias Pass before I expected to.  When I thought that I had about 10 miles more to go, a passing trucker gave me a big honk from his horn and a thumbs up sign.  I thought how nice that he was encouraging me.  Around the next bend I saw a small sign that said:  Marias Pass, Continental Divide, Elev 5,280. I had made it! I stopped at a roadside area dedicated to the first white man to floow the pass through this area.  It was a chance to warm up and savor the moment.  There was a woman who pulled in who wanted to take my picture - just to prove there was a crazy guy riding a bike over the Continental Divide, in the snow.  She was kind enough to take a picture with my camera, as well. The rest of the ride was basically downhill, with beautiful scenery.  An added advantage to crossing the Divide was a drastic improvement in the weather - warmer and less snow on the side of the road.           
The ride from West Glacier to Eureka was straight and uneventful.  The town of Whitefish is a nice little place, with a street that still looks like an old western town.  As I passed the local bike shop, I saw two loaded bikes outside.  I stopped to see who was traveling through.  There were two guys inside who were both named Smith and were traveling together from Missoula, MT to Anchorage, AL (Jeff Smith from Kansas; Ralph Smith from Philadelphia, PA.  They told me that they had also experienced similar bad weather, and had even ridden through some snow (for those of you who think I might be crazy - even I have my limits - no riding in the snow - yet).  We chatted for awhile took pictures, and then I was on my way.  It was nice to see other travelers.   
Today was a beautiful day, and my route followed a lake for about 55 miles.  The area is very similar to the Finger Lakes in New York state, I assume because glaciers carved both areas.  While the guide book indicated that the route would be mostly flat, it was rolling hills for the 50-odd miles that ran by the lake.  I did see two osprey sitting by their nest, in a tree by the lake. I am told that the nests are added to each year by the birds and become very heavy, eventually weighing tons.  Later, I saw another osprey fishing for dinner (watching him I almost drove off the road).  Another treat was watching a moose walk across the road about 500 yards in front of me. As I came to the end of the lake, I met a fellow rider, heading in the opposite direction.  We stopped and chatted for a while and I commented that his bike had a lot less equipment than my bike had.  Basically, he was riding with two bags, which were about the size of the smaller two of my four bags.  He explained that he had so much trouble going over Washington Pass that he had shipped most of his equipment an clothing home.  He was down to three sets of riding clothes with some cool weather pants and tops.  He was down to the minimum (or below).  It showed the variety of approaches you see on a trip like this one. The final 15 miles took me from Libby, MT to Troy, MT.  The road was pretty busy and the side of the road was sandy, holding the shattered remains of beer bottles (truly a hazard of the road).  The day had become hot by now, and I was glad to reach the end of the day's ride. I arrived in Troy and had time for a nice dinner and a welcome shower - the simple joys.           
Another beautiful day, and a better route for riding (although I must admit that at least once a day I thoroughly curse the drivers on the road, and/or the route makers at Adventure Cycling). Today I reaped the rewards of riding through the sand/glass coming out of Libby - a flat tire.  Before I fixed the tire, I checked for the cause and found a brown-tinted wedge of glass stuck in the tire.  I pried it out to prevent continuing problems, and then I replaced the tube. Today I saw a number of other people taking tours, all going West to East.  All of them mention the 5 mountain passes that I have to ride in Washington state.  For some reason no one smiles when they mention the passes.  Mostly they just mention that it takes time.  One group did mention that they did not enjoy coming down the 26 mile downside of one of the passes because it was snowing.  (Ah, for the adventures of the open road!) I am in Clark Fork, ID in a very nice little library.  I have about 30 miles to go to get to Sandpoint, my destination for the night.   
Today was an "easy" day.  I did laundry and had a leisurely breakfast to start the day.  As I was getting ready to begin the day's ride, I saw Sandy Dardenelle & John Bracklow, with whom I had exchanged emails.  It was amazing that we ran into each other because neither of us were "on the route" at the time we met.  At first we did not raealize who were had met. Actually we were chatting for a while and they began telling me about a detour I would need to take in about 20 miles.  When I pulled out my map, Sandy asked why my map differed from their map.  I explained that my map was a couple of years old because I had started in June 2000, and was doing the ride in segments.  John looked up and said, "Are you Dave?"  I looked and said, "Are you John and Sandy?"  Proper acknowledgements all around determined we were indeed who we were. We had a nice visit and exchanged road details, happy that we had met, and then my day began. Except for the heat of the day, it was beautiful riding - relatively flat, a slight tail wind, and not much traffic.  I met a group of 5 college-aged riders, who were drying in the sun, after a cooling dip in a local river.  I was tempted to jump in and cool of as well, but realized if I got too comfortable, I would not ride the final 20 miles to Usk.  A few miles outside of Usk, I stopped for a breather.  Hearing a rustling sound in the woods, I looked around and spotted two deer running deeper into the woods. Tonight I stayed in the Hotel Usk, run by a very nice couple.  The man's father had lived in Ipswich, MA as a young boy, which was a nice connection.  Usk is a community center of about 5 buildings, which include a bar and the Usk Hotel, fortunately.  The Usk Mall is hardly a shoppers paradise - although they do buy and sell antlers.     
Today is Father's Day and I was able to speak on the phone with both of my daughters (Emily and Hannah) - so it was a great day! The ride today was very nice.  The first 30 miles were flat and along a river.  There was a steep 5-mile climb that gave me a preview of the climbs I will be doing over the next several days.  The good news is that I made it. While riding today I met a couple who had just retired and were riding across the country.  The woman had injured her knee, so she was driving their van for a while, but she intended to get back on her bike soon.  They were headed to Falmouth, MA - again an easy connection. (Has Rome so faded in its glory that all roads now lead to Boston?) I also met two young women who were crossing the country - doing the entire trail from Anacortes, WA to Bar Harbor, ME.  We talked about the route a little and I learned that they had taken the Curlew alternative route, which I was considering.  They said it was beautiful, but that the climb into Curlew seemed as if it would be very steep going in my direction (because it was a great downhill for them).  I was already leaning toward following the main passes on the assumption that they would be the most consistently graded, for truck traffic.  These comments convinced me.  (We'll see.) Animal spottings for the day:  One black bear, who walked across the road in front of me and was sitting in a field as I went by a few minutes later - he stood up tall, looked at me and ran away (I didn't think that I had become that wild looking on the road). (Don't bother looking for a bear picture - I was happy enough to pass by with as littell fuss as possible.) Several deer at various points on the route Two hawks flying over a field on a detour I followed, because the main road was torn up for repaving.
Another beautiful day.  This day is the first of the days for riding over mountain passes.  I have decided that I will enjoy the trip much better if I plan to ride one pass each day.  Today's pass is Sherman Pass (elevation 5,575 feet).  (I was told that it is the highest pass in Washington state, but have not confirmed this myself.) The ride was long and challenging, but I made it.  I find that riding hills is a combination of legs, gear ratios, the grade of the road and energy level.  My setup is just making it, and as my energy level sinks, the effort is harder.  I am not sure that I could do two passes in a day, if I tried. Again I met a nice couple traveling east.  As usual we chatted for a while and were on our way.  We had a very pleasant visit because I had just ridden through the Pass, which made me feel good, and I was able to tell them they had only a few hundred yards to the Pass, which made them feel very good. I am staying in Republic, which seems like a very nice town.  The Library has computer access, and another group allows travelers access also - a very considerate town.     
Today's ride went well.  The climb through Wauconda Pass (elev. 4,310 feet) was not very difficult.  About 5 miles before I reached the pass, the weather got stormy - strong winds followed by about 10 minutes of hail (instead of rain) followed by strong winds again.  The entire "storm" took about 20 minutes and then it settled down to overcast.  About 30 minutes later, I started to hear thunder rumbling behind me, but I had passed through the storm before it developed fully.  (I heard on the evening weather report that the area I passed through had thunder and lightning for much of the day.  Fortunately, I had avoided it.) Later in the day I had a few brief showers, but nothing serious. I met two young men (late 20s??) who were riding East.  We discussed the route, and they seemed to be taking a perverse pleasure in the mountain passes.  When I told them that they were approaching a mile-long hill that was listed as a 6% grade, they just smiled and said, "Oh yeah, we're used to those."  I envied them their young legs.       
Today's climb was through Loup Loup Pass (elev. 4,020 feet), which was more difficult than I had anticipated.  I met and chatted with a retired woman who was traveling with another couple (each day, two would bike and one would drive their van, with all of the equipment).  She said that she considered Loup Loup Pass to be harder than Washington Pass (which made me feel better).  As we talked, however, she paused and said, "Of course, you will be riding up the other way, which seemed pretty steep."  (So much for "feeling better.") I stopped for lunch in a touristy town called Winthrop (I have noticed a number of town names that are similar to town names around Boston).  The town is designed like an old west town - wooden sidewalks, overhangs over the sidewalks, old-fashioned signs, etc - but everything has the look and smell of new wood.  The effect is pleasing, none the less (perhaps made more pleasant by the fact that it is a lunch break - away from riding time). Tonight, I am staying at the Mazama Ranch Resort - a motel/riding resort, with a very nice Inn and restaurant.  It is very comfortable - a good preparation for  a full day I have planned for tomorrow.     
Today was a good ride.  I combined distance with a pass crossing, but it took a long time.  Today, I crossed Washington Pass (elev.  5,477) and Rainy Pass (elev. 4,855), which is sort of an addendum to Washington Pass.  While Washington Pass had some steep sections, I was able to climb it much faster and more easily than what I had dreaded.  (As is often the case, I worried this task into a bigger effort than it really required.) The downhill run was pretty nice - still beautiful scenery, and not much pedaling for about 15 miles!  This section has been beautiful, the mountains are awe-inspiring and now there are plenty of streams and rivers and cascades coming down the sides of the mountains.  One benefit of the cascades is a bit of natural air conditioning - as you pass the streams and cascades, the air is chilled, providing excellent cooling. Today I saw several deer, as I have on most days.  I even saw a wild rabbit.  I would have ridden by the rabbit completely unaware, except that it moved and made enough noise to attract my attention. Tonight, I am staying at the Clark Cabins motel.  One of their claims to fame is the 150 to 200 domesticated rabbits roaming the grounds.  Today is rabbit day, I guess.                 
After the mountains of the past several days, today has been more ordinary - fairly flat roads and routine scenery (similar to New England roadside scenery).  The miles seemed slower today, perhaps because I am nearing the end of my trip. As I approached Anacortes, I had some anxious moments trying to coordinate a rental car to get to the airport in Seattle.  Finally, everything fell into place nicely and I was able to finish the ride in the official ending location, a small park with access to the water.  I dipped my wheel in the water and had a local visitor take some pictures.  I called home to share the news - and the trip has ended! I had a wonderful dinner at a restaurant called the Nantucket Inn.  I had a full meal, which was well prepared and I ate everything, including a slice of very nice cheesecake.  The restaurant was lovely, there was a cool breeze blowing through the windows on this balmy evening - a great finish! (Note: at one point I had planned to ride a portion of the Olympic Peninsula, but that portion of the ride was just not practical given my timing, the logistics and the issue of traffic.)               
It was great to walk out of the passenger area and see a cluster of familiar faces waving and holding up a welcoming sign - a special thanks to those who were able to join Anne and Hannah: my brother Pete, and the Geraghty family (Tim and Nancy and John and Elizabeth).  Thanks also to the many others who have been so encouraging to me - just another crazy guy on a bike.   
Now that my journey is complete and I have had time to gather my thoughts and complete my journal, I want to take a few minutes to try to wrap it all up. While I was going through the planning and riding of my journey, there were two common questions:  Why are you doing this?  (a variation included: Are you doing this to raise money?); and Do you listen to music on the road? There are many answers to the first question, but primarily, I did this ride as a challenge to see if I could do it.  It was wonderful to see friends along the way and to see the country 'up close and personal,' as they say, but the continuing drive was to ride all the way across the country.   On the variant question, I did not do this ride as a fund-raiser, although many people do a wonderful job combining the effort with fund-raising - just not part of my ride. Because I did a solo ride, many people thought about the loneliness of the ride and wondered if I listened to music on the ride (hence, the second most common question).  Actually, the thought never occurred to me.  During my last segment I did bring along music, which Anne had prepared for me - something both inspirational to get me over the mountains, and whimsical to keep me amused.  I listened to the music on a few evenings and during a few days of riding.  However, I found the music could be distracting and get annoying as I got tired, so I did not make it a regular part of my routine.  For me, lonliness was not a serious problem - there were moments, but not many. Now that I am finished with this trip, almost everyone asks the same question: Where are you going on your next bike trip?  Interestingly, this trip has dominated so much of my time since June 2000, that I do not have any plans for future bike trips, as big as this one.  There are many things that I have pushed to the background.  Now I would like to spend time on those parts of my life.  Hopefully I will still have time for one or two short, local trips on my bike, but nothing extended, for now. The final photos that I include here include a picture of Don Cockman - a friend from the road - and me, with a cake that was prepared to celebrate the completion of my trip.  The second picture is a close-up of the caketop - the wonders of technology, they transferred a photocopy onto the caketop, in frosting. Finally, I want to thank everyone who supported my journey, especially my immediate family, but also my friends, and the people I met along the road, and the people who read this journal and wished me well.  For me this has been a wonderful experience, something that I thought about doing for a very long time, and I am glad that I was able to attempt it, and to complete it.  I hope that each of you is able to experience something as fulfilling in your own life. My best to you all, Dave     
thats the what, and im sure you're curious as to the why, or you wouldn't be here. hopefully, you already know the why, but ill type it up anyhow... about two years ago, while working as a bike messenger in manhatten, i got bronchitis. this kept me out of work for a week. as it was clearing up, i headed out to a bmx video premiere in binghamton new york for a weekend of drunken rowndiness and debauchery. it was a blast to say the least. upon returning to my brooklyn apartment, i found myself with a complete lack of desire to go to work. so i didn't. several months later i found myself with this great job, getting paid to ride my bike around different towns in long island taking pictures of intersections. i was loving it, the pay was great, i saw new towns, got exercise and fresh air. after a while though, i just decided that work isn't for me, no matter what work it is. for some reason, i had a permanent case of 'office space'. i dragged it out, working a few days a month, and selling some of my artwork to help finance my rent. i thought about buying some cheap land out in nevada or alaska and living off the grid for a while. then i thought about riding out to whatever land i purchased. then i thought about just riding around and seeing the country, continent, land mass, world whatever before i settled on one place. then i thought about all the places i ever wanted to go mountain biking, and the fact that this would allow me to ride those places.  so i regrettably told my roommates that i would be leaving them at the end of may, which i did, and doing a pretrip out to colorado, back to massachusetts, then down to the southwest and mexico. the plans were abridged, but within four days, i will be leaving for my southwest/mexico trip, which will be another journal. this one is about my "test" trip, a two week, fully loaded tour up to pedrosfest, to visit friends in new hampshire and back. all distances are approximate based on past experience, maps, and time out there. i dont use a cycling computer.

i eventually made it to bear mountain bridge, but not before snagging the corded tie downs on my new, expensive panniers and snapping one of them. it was a simple fix, but bothersome nonetheless. bear mountain bridge was under construction, so i took the only logical route for non-motorized traffic, the footpath. unfortunately the bear mountain bridge footpath is not even wide enough to easily get my bike w/panniers across. one side or the other was rubbing a part of the bridge the whole way across. i was lucky i suppose, that at this point in my trip, i had my knobby tires strapped to the outside of my panniers, so they worked like bumpers. once across, i am on bike route 9d for quite some time. through cold spring. called my old roommate aaron to let him know i rode through his home town. the pictures below were taken right above cold spring. one is the tunnel with generous shoulder that i rode through, the others are (i think)9w where it is cut into the face of a cliff. i couldn't be sure as there was a hudson river between the cliff and myself. then there is a shot of the mountain right before the tunnel, shrouded in mist.         rode right past the road i was supposed to take, and knew it the whole time. ended up riding all the way up to poughkeepsie, where i stopped at a very helpful bike shop to ask for directions. one of the employees offered to fill up my water bottle and bladder(camelback). on the way to the sink, he decided that the hose would be a better idea. so we walk out behind the shop, he attatches the hose, and i go to work filling my fillables full of what fills such things. i thank him, get back on the bike and take off on the excellent connector route they sent me on. only, 100 ft across the parking lot, i noticed this strange and horrible taste in the water from my camelback. so i tried my bottle as well. it was like a mixture of bug spray and rubber, obviously from the hose we used. oh well, press on. it was a ways before i found a convenient stream to filter water out of, but even in doing so, that wretched taste stayed in the water bladder for three days.   once i connected with 44, it was fairly smooth sailing. steady drizzle the entire way, except for that torrential downpour around 5:30, south of millerton. on the one downhill during the downpour, a car pulled up next to me, the guy rolled down the window and shouted "37mph!!" with a big grin on his face. i responded with an equally large grin and we parted ways. millerton is a neat little town. i sat in the gazebo across from their bike path that didnt head in my direction for about an hour. i just sat there, eating grapes and drying off. finally got up and back on the bike, up the short steep hill, and down the road a little bit, where i spotted an american legion post. im SAL, so i stopped in, changed into dryer clothes, had a few sodas, chatted with the locals, signed the guestbook. i asked if i could camp under thier pavillion, but the man in charge said he didn't know if it was ok by the local law, and didn't show any interest in finding out. so i rode off to route 41, which crosses the appelachian trail twice, and brings me through the northwest corner of connecticut and into massachusetts. i cant remember for the life of me if i camped in ct, or ma, but it was in a grassy area right near a trailhead. i dont think it was the at though, just a connector perhaps. 
      
after the sky seemed to come to grips with itself, after lightning struck thier sattelite dish not four feet from my head, i left and rolled down that wonderful 112 downhill, all the way to route 2. the pictures below are on route 2, part of the mohawk trail of tears, on a bridge overlooking the deerfield river.           as i hoofed the bike up one short but pesky hill a little while later, some rednecks in a truck thought it would be proper and good to yell out "get a car!". being a former bike messenger, my initial reaction was to chase after them on my bike and get up in thier face about it. but the weight of my bike, the fact that i was not in the city, the fact that it was just a dumbass making a dumbass comment, and the fact that i would have to walk all the way back up the hill after futily trying to chase them down made me reconsider and resort to simply letting the bird fly in thier general direction. not the most mature response, but it shows restraint from my typical reaction. this was my only bad motorist occurance. a little while further i came upon a farm stand and got a overloaded pint(+) of absolutely deliscious blueberries, a few husks of corn, and some plums. the people that were running the farm stand were extremely helpful and kind. very enthusiastic about the fact that i was riding up to keene. when i told them where i had come from, the were a little taken back. i dont think they had ever met a bikepacker before. a little ways up route 5 from there, a fella out on his daily ride caught up with me and i rode with him for a while. we chatted about where i was going, the best route to get there, etc. it was a huge help to ride with someone, to have someone to pace myself by. after a while, he took off to continue on his way. he hit some pretty decent speed leaving me, probably holding 23-25mph as he accellerated away as far as i could see. the reason i was headed for keene was to visit with my longtime friend steve and his family, who i hadn't spoken to in years. due solely to losing touch. i for some reason assumed that they would be at the same residence, despite divorce. so i pedalled on, i got into the town of keene right around dark, and knew that the house was still another 45 minute ride to the north edge of town, up a bigass hill. so i called my mom to double check what i knew to be the adress. i didn't have a phone number, so i was going on luck. i eventually got going, and it was pitch dark out. i hoofed up that huge hill, and started rolling down the other side to thier old house on peg shop road. when i pulled into the driveway, just after 9, i was so relieved to just be there. i knocked on the door, and peered inside through the window. childrens toys EVERYWHERE. unless steve had a kid in the last year or two, this was not a good sign. sure enough a stranger opened the door to a greeting of "i guess the petersens dont live anymore, huh?". i felt defeated, and quite embarassed. luckily the owner was friendly and helpful, telling me all he could remember about where the petersens had moved to. i couldnt bring myself to ask the guy if i could camp in his yard, or the woods right next to it, i was too embarassed. i played it off like i had somewhere else to go in town, and rode up to the powerlines at the top of the hill. setting up camp that night was a living hell. the mosquitos in new hampshire have intelligence. they are silent, huge, and efficient. your worst nightmare. by the time i got everything together, got out of my riding clothes and got into my tent, i was pissed off, embarrassed and downhearted. just as i was about to fall asleep, the screech owl in the tree right above me decided to do his thing for a few minutes. i knew what it was, but still jumped every time it screeched. 
   VOILA!, an adress in five minutes. i rode over to the house, great rail trail connecting keene and swanzey i would later discover. luck started looking my way because steve's mom had decided to take her lunch at home and was only going to be there for fifteen minutes. i happened to show up during those fifteen minutes. she was shocked to say the least to see me knocking on her front door. i was welcomed as i had been when they lived on my street, and melanie went off to work while i took a shower and snacked a little. after i was showered, and had checked my email, i rode back to keene without any of my gear. i stopped into the friendly's where lauren was working and gave her a bit of a shock too, when she turned around to see me there. i had a grilled veggie sandwich and chatted with her, when she wasn't waiting on others. 

   i was right about the thunderstorms. i could see them over the next range, this big, black ominous sky, flashing rapidly with lightening. i turned off of route 9 to go say goodbye to lauren at work, but as i was riding north, a woman pulled over next to me, rolled down her window and told me that there were mini tornados touching down in the area, and that i should seek shelter immediately. she offered me a ride into town, but i knew that there was no way we were getting my bike in her little hatchback. i said thank you for the information, and turned around, heading back to the petersens for one more night. after the trip, i found out that the area i would have been camping in was declared a disaster area from the damage caused by the minitwisters, and the heavy rain. THANK YOU TORNADO WARNING LADY!! 
        on route 30, here you can see my tires strapped to the sleeping bag. this is usually not the stup i go with. normally, it would be my sleeping pad and tent strapped to the front rack. i just messed up. it really made no difference though.     further up route thirty, which is a very pleasant ride, if you ever have the chance, i ran into this long, beautiful covered bridge. i'm all about the covered wooden bridges now. the smell of the wood inside, the shelter they offer in a storm, you just cant beat them.           i ended up riding too far up on rt 30. up past newfane before i realized it. so i turned aroudn and headed back, got myself directions to where i was headed. rode through some beautiful terrain connecting rt 30 and rt 100 at mount snow. long push up the mountain in west dover. once on 100, it was an enjoyable, scenic ride down to route 9. i assumed that by riding up 30, and down 100, that i would miss the construction i was warned about on route 9, but it wasn't the case. this didn't make rt 9 unenjoyable though, in fact it was the exact oppositte. when i came upon flagmen/women, the almost all waved me through, making the traffic coming from the other direction wait longer or stop just for me. they all greeted me with a smile and a wave, and got one in return. the parts that werent limited to one lane, were like riding on a really big, wide dirt road. i loved it. before reaching route 8, i turned off on **** rd which connected with it. excellent choice. i saw maybe five cars the entire time. which was good, because when you're pushing your 85lbs of bike and gear up a huge hill, the last thing you want is to be inhaling car exhaust. it was a really nice ride/hike to the top, where i was surprised to find windmills. i didn't think they saw much use on this side of the country. from the top, it was a very long, very high speed downhill almost all the way to route 2 in mass. i stopped and shopped at a stop&shop, then continued on down to the festival site. rolling through the entrance, i was greeted by the first fellow volunteer with "now THATS the way to arrive!". it brought a smile to my face. pedrosfest. where to begin? i dont know, so ill let the pictures speak for themselves for now....

About the pictures:  In the midst of all the other preparations we brought the digital camera along, but forgot to get it ready.  The memory was almost full and the battery charge was really low when we took it out to take our first pictures.  It was a couple days before we figured out how to get it charged in camp.  Pictures are a little sparse until the third day.  [This is Connie.  What Bob really means is that I forgot to get the camera ready.  We charged the battery in the back of the shower truck...who knew?] I started cycling 3 years ago (at age 50) in desperation when my knees would no longer tolerate running.  For a long time I did just mountain biking.  Then I started riding the MTB to work.  That led to a road bike.  A year ago I got my wife to start mountain biking too.  [Yeah! Fat, old biker chick...that's me!]  We also got a tandem thinking that would be the most enjoyable way to ride together on the road.  [Do you know that you get absolutely no respect when you're on the back of a tandem?  I tell people about our trip and they're all impressed, until I say we rode on a tandem, and then they say "oh" with a knowing look.  Believe me, Bob's in much better biking shape than I am, but there is absolutely no way he could pull us up those hills if I weren't pedaling like mad.  We're what is called a "big team" and it's not because of the size of our quads.] It was my brother-in-law who got me interesting in bike touring.  He told me about Adventure Cycling and I began to look around the net.  I read journals in "Crazy Guy on a Bike" and joined the T@H (tandem@hobbes) and phred (touring) mailing lists.  (Both of these lists are fantastic resources.)  The idea of riding across the country caught my attention.  Since my longest bike ride at that point had been a 22 mile mountain bike ride, this was a considerable leap of imagination on my part.  My wife Connie gave me that "oh, oh, here he goes again" look. She's been humoring my enthusiasms for 30 years now, so she's practiced at being supportive while maintaining a mild skepticism.  [Oh, is that what he calls it?  I thought I was just looking at him like he was your standard male person suffering from testosterone poisoning.  Doesn't every wife look at her husband that way?]  She admitted, though, that it would be interesting if we could actually pull it off. Connie started riding as well about a year ago and liked it.  We've always been involved in physical activities, but lately we hadn't been able to do much. Our bodies were wearing out and we needed to find different activities.  Cycling seems like the perfect sport to turn to. So now with both of us enjoying cycling, Connie was willing to talk about touring.  That's where this tour comes in.  We knew we needed to start slowly.  First we thought we would do a couple of overnight credit card rides.  In May we rode from Palo Alto to Mill Valley, stayed over night, and then rode back the next day.  It was 55 miles each way and we survived, though we were pretty sore.  [Start slowly?  Part of that trip was on a busy freeway (scared me to death riding across the on and off ramps) and part of it was over the Golden Gate Bridge (beautiful!) on San Francisco Bay.  We stayed in a nice hotel, and talked the staff into letting us take our tandem into our room because we were afraid to part with it.  It was so brand new and so pretty -- it's a light to dark blue fade, my favorite color.  With my first long bike ride under my belt, I enjoyed a huge dinner and didn't skimp on anything.  Obviously that put more under my belt, but talk about guilt-free eating!]  We had only done one overnight, but we didn't want to let the summer get away.  The next step was to try a week long tour.  [More like a leap.]  We wanted to do something supported and had lots of time constraints.  Our kids are both in college and we didn't want to be gone while they were home.  The Oregon Bicycle Ride began to look like the best option.  Connie took some persuading though.  She wasn't sure we could do the distance and climbing, but the big one was the heat.  The ride was in Eastern Oregon and temperatures in the 90's could be expected every afternoon.  Bill Martin and Sandy Green answered a lot of questions by email and assured us that if we had done back to back 50 mile days, we could do the ride.  They didn't sugar coat the weather predictions. [But Bob did!  Well not exactly.  He'd say that it might get up into the 90's, and give me that ever-hopeful, "pleeeese be ok with this" look that I can rarely resist.] Connie's biggest worry was the heat.  [I was imagining hot flashes + 100 degree temperatures + riding a tandem thousands of feet of vertical out in the mid-day sun, listening to "are you pedaling?"  Turned out I was too hot to know if I was having hot flashes, but the rest of it came true for sure.]  I promised her that we would start early every day to avoid the heat.  "No later than 8." I told her.  I am not an early to rise person.  I thought getting packed up and out by 8 would be an accomplishment.  Boy was I clueless.  More about that later.  [I can't get Bob out for a ride on any old weekend before 10 am.  Practicing mild skepticism again.] The single thing that clinched the deal was the OBR's sag policy.  They will allow you in and out of the sag wagon whenever you like within reason.  On the sixth day, there was an 8 mile climb, 6 percent, the 3rd long climb of the day.  We figured we had a reservation in the sag wagon for that climb.   So, against her better judgment, we signed up for OBR.  "Now look at the pickle you've gotten us into, Ollie!"
We got the thickest Thermarest available, the Camp Rest LE.  These are heavy but turned out to be worth it.  They worked well. [Better than just the cold, hard ground better.  But we were jealous when we saw other people with real cots and big air mattresses.  When the truck carries all your stuff, go for it.  As newbies, we dutifully restricted ourselves to two bags per person, for all our gear.  Other folks had several bags, folding chairs, tents, and those shade things the well-prepared parents bring to swim meets and soccer matches.] I hate sleeping bags.  I just can't stand having may legs constrained while I sleep.  I have been trying to figure out how I could sleep comfortably.  My idea was to get a rectangular bag and a sleep sack for a sheet.  Until it got too cold, I would crawl into the sleep sack and try to use the bag as a quilt, completely unzipped.  We got identical bags, 45 degree REI.  They weighed about a pound and half each and were reasonably cheap.  The sleepsacks are polyester and very light.  They provide about 4 degrees of insulation according to the label.  This worked great for me.  I never needed to zip up the bag.  The temp reached down into the 40s, I think.  [I, on the other hand, froze to death the first night.  I had to resort to my sweat pants and ski hat.  After that first night I was fine, though.  Maybe the metabolism kicked up a notch.] We got little head mounted LED lights.  I really liked this for reading and dealing with a dark tent.  Connie hardly used hers.  A wide angle light to hang in the tent was barely used.  We also brought along a big flashlight, but that never got used.  [You have got to picture this: pitch dark outside, with a whole campful of dark tents, and ours must look like there's a madman with a flashlight doing calisthenics inside.  Bob's got this headlamp thing on, and can't find anything in the dark.  He's rooting around in all the stuff, swearing none too softly, headlamp flashing in all directions, looking for his pillow, his book, then his glasses (which were in his hand at least once).  He's irritable because he's tired and I'm lying there with my eyes closed (partly from being blinded by the headlamp thing), trying to pretend this isn't as funny as it looks and trying to keep from laughing.  And he doesn't think I can keep my mouth shut!]  I was really worried about hydration.  I have long noticed that a lot of sweating would give me headaches, often migraines.  Despite trying to heavily hydrate myself, the problems would still occur.  I knew that on a 7 day bike trip in the heat,I would be miserable if I couldn't fix this problem.  I decided that what I was missing was electrolytes.  I had tried drinking a bottle of Gatorade along with my Camelback, but that didn't seem to be enough.  I wanted to try adding a lot more electrolytes while drinking.  To do that I had to find some drink that I could mix from powder and could stand to drink all day from my Camelback.  From three LBSs, I got sample size packages of every sport drink and flavor I could find.  After sampling them all and studying their contents, I ended up settling on Green Gatorade, the same thing I had drunk all along.  It tasted by far the best to me and you can buy it in bulk at Costco.  [I too participated in the great electrolytes blind-tasting test.  I knew I would just drink whatever Bob chose, but he wanted me to try them anyway so I wouldn't complain--who me?.  Some of them tasted like sugar-coated, metal tooth fillings.  We settled on a drink in a nice shade of green.]  I would fill my Camelback with 2/3 - 3/4 strength Gatorade every morning and top it up at the rest stops.  I carried one bottle of plain water for when I just needed some plain water to drink.  This worked great for me.  We rode long hills in blistering heat.  I KNOW I wasn't able to replace all the fluid I lost during the day, but I always felt reasonably good at the end of the day. No headaches.  [No problems for me either, but I felt like I would float away from all the liquid I drank.  I love the Camelback so I can take sips frequently to keep my mouth and throat from getting too dry while panting up all those hills.]
We arrived about 3, in plenty of time to check-in.  A lot of tents were up on the grassy area at the fairgrounds, and people and bicycles were everywhere.  We had reserved a hotel room for the first night.  Not having slept on the ground in more than a decade, it seemed like good idea to ease into it.  We also wouldn't have to figure out how to strike the tent and pack up before starting the first day's ride.  It seemed a little sad to leave the site of the excitement when we went off to the hotel.  [Before we left, we had dinner at the fairgrounds and got to know our 150 riding companions.  We had our story all worked out before we arrived.  We'd be among the "older" riders, entitled to an automatic, "no-fault" pass to the back of the pack.  While the age range of the group was 18 to over 80, the median age was probably in the mid-40's.  There were lots of folks our age and older, and most seemed to know each other, to have done the OBR many times before, to be seasoned campers, with fancy bikes, nifty camping gear, and every piece of biker clothing you can imagine.  We decided our "not too bad for old farts" excuse probably wouldn't cut it, and changed our story to "first-time on tour" people.  Bill Martin gave us beginners (20 or so) an orientation after dinner, and we were introduced to "chamois butter" and "bag balm."  I decided to stick with the diaper rash ointment my sister had recommended.  Yup, that's where you put it.]  We thought we were probably the only ones who were wussie enough to be staying in the hotel, but we should have known better.  Parked in front of the room next to ours was a BMW SUV with 2 Lightspeeds on the back and one inside.  Other cars had nice bikes too.  It was clear we were not alone.   We set the alarm clock for 6 am to be bright and early back to the fairgrounds.
At the end of breakfast, we got our stuff together and got ready to ride.  By then it was about 7:30.  Plenty early by my reckoning, but almost everyone had left.  It was clear these people do not have the proper respect for a good nights sleep. There was some trepidation mixed with the excitement of getting started.  The first two days were both about 57 miles.  Just slightly longer that we had ridden before, so we knew we could do it.  But we would also be a hundred miles from our car when we started out on the third day.  That would be the first time we had ridden significant distance 3 days in a row and the day would be the longest we had ridden by 28 miles and the most climbing that we had done on the tandem, by far.  [We'd only had the tandem about three months, and we were still trying to get used to each other--Bob, me and the tandem.] The morning was beautiful and cool when we started at 7:45.  We slogged up a hill on the way out of town.  Tandems do not climb fast!  By the end of the trip, we would not class this as a climb, just a little rise.  [Looking back on it, I realize that other riders were probably wondering if that big team on the blue tandem was really going to make it all the way.  We had to stop at the end of that first little hill to take off a few layers of clothes as we were completely overdressed.  I was meeting lots of riders that day...but only by watching their backsides as they passed us and rode ahead.  Unfortunately in camp that evening I didn't recognize anyone from the front.]  A couple more modest climbs and we came out along the Metolius River gorge.  Everyone pulled over at the first overlook and spent a while ooohhing and ahhing.  It was a great view.    The route rolled along by the gorge and then off into the fields.  After 25 miles or so we see our first rest stop.  The food is great.  M&Ms, Oreos, canteloup, pineapple, Cheeze-its, peanut butter, chips and salsa.  [Aaah, the food!  This was one of the best things about the ride!  The rest stop people had something for everyone.  More guilt-free eating after all those miles.] The route went through Smith Rock State Park.  This is a great rock climbing area.  Right by the park is a little store that sells huckleberry ice cream.  The store didn't open until noon though, so nobody got to try it.  The rest of the route was flat through pleasant farm land.  [The route went through Smith Rock State Park, but we almost didn't.  The first couple of days of the ride had lots of turns, and we thought we'd missed the turn to Smith Rock.  So  we turned around two or three times, searching, and Bob almost dumped us over discovering that the turning radius of the tandem is about the same as a panel truck.]  When we arrived in Prineville, it seemed like all the tents were already set up.  This would be the pattern for the ride.  [We soon discovered that the tent spaces along the fences were very popular, so you could wash out your biking clothes in the shower or in some buckets available for that purpose, and hang them on the fence to dry.  Others used clothespins to attach their clothes to the ribs of their tent.  Since we were late getting to camp, we had no fence and of course no clothespins (not on the packing list) so we just hung our clothes on our folding chairs.  This was also the day of discovering the joys of showering in a shower truck.  I hit the showers at rush hour, and the humidity was suffocating.  I learned better timing the rest of the trip, and the shower truck actually worked great.  They had rows of sinks with mirrors outside the truck for teeth brushing and shaving.]  The afternoon heat was oppressive.  We found a restaurant and discovered how good a beer and nachos supreme could taste after spending a few hours riding a bike in the heat.  The waitress was friendly and we told about the bike and that we were riding to Paul-ee-na in the morning.  She looked blank and then recognition lit up her face.  "Ah, Paul-eye-na.  That's a long way."  So, its "Paul-eye-na" from now on. We also found some sun hats.  We had remembered all the camping gear and bike gear but forgotten that we would be out in the sun during the hours after riding.  We both left great sun hats at home in the closet.  [Now we were the big team with the dorky matching sunhats.] Dinner was spare ribs.  They were incredibly good!  We couldn't believe how good these ribs were, served out of the back of a U-Haul.  [Sitting in the shade of the dining canopy, I discovered large red blotches covering both my thighs and parts of both calves.  The red looked like little bumps, but didn't feel bumpy, and didn't itch or sting.  I always wear SPF45 sun screen everywhere, since I'm a pale, freckled red head, so I knew I wasn't sunburned.   The camp manager gave me some cream to rub on my legs, but the redness spread further that night, before gradually fading over the next few days.  Someone suggested it was heat rash, and another said it was sun poisoning.  I don't know what it was, but it didn't bother me and it went away.]  The first night in the tent went fine, though it was a little hot.  The thick Thermarests gave plenty of cushion and my idea of sleeping in a sleepsack and using the bag as a quilt worked just as I'd hoped.  [I didn't sleep very well flat on my back that first night.  Made it through the night without a trip to the bathroom though, probably because it was so dry in Eastern Oregon!]  So far so good.  The legs were sore, but not too bad.  We set the alarm for 6 am.
Breakfast was at a church a few blocks away. It was great.  By the time we were done, we were at the back of the pack.  Just outside of town, we started the one long climb of the day.  It was several miles of moderate grade.  Looking at a topo map of the route, this day looked like it would be a long dry ride through the high desert.  The ride was unexpectedly beautiful.  The climb in the cool of the morning was lined with small pine trees.  The top of the climb was followed by a short descent and then some rollers followed by a long fast down hill. This was the biggest descent we had tried on the tandem.  It was very unlike the climb.  It dropped off steeply with a lot of curves through a canyon.  We took the curves so slowly that the singles were passing us.   [Alright I confess.  I'm not supposed to use the drag brake without permission of the Captain, but our first big downhill was scary!  I may have just put that little old drag brake on a little bit without him noticing.  I had to let up, though, when the singles overtook us.  Looked suspicious.]  Then the grade let up a little after a couple of miles and we felt safe enough to let the tandem run.  We quickly caught up with the singles and passed them.  What a blast! This is where the tandem is incredibly fun.  On a moderate grade, a tandem just cuts through the air and you feel like you have Sea Biscuit's legs.  A good tandem is rock solid.  The tires hum and the wind is loud in your ears.  There's a real sensation of power and speed.  [Some of that humming was the stoker yelling from behind against the wind, "Boy, are we going fast!"] We had switched over into an adjacent valley.  This valley was only 200-500 yards wide, carpeted with green from the river and irrigation.  The remainder of the ride wound slowly up the river valley for 35 miles and perhaps 400 of net rise. Coming over a small rise, there was a Y in the road.  OBR to the right the sign said.  We were in Paulina.  This was a little different from Prineville.  There were about 10 buildings total, including a two-room school, a church, a store and a dance hall.  We camped on the grass behind the school, a tight fit.  [Since we were just about last to camp, as usual, we had to lug our camping gear and belongings all the way across camp to the far edge.  After two 50+ mile days, my legs felt like rubber.  It was a slow walk across camp.  But it felt so good to stop pedaling!  Sandwiches were available for lunch, and they sure tasted good.  There was a shortage of shade, so that dorky sunhat was a welcome sight.]  It was very hot again as we ambled... No, ambled sounds too fast.  We shuffled down the road to the store.  Ahh, beer!  The pastor of the church was working on an addition.  Someone asked him about his flock and he said he gets between 5 and 32 each week.  The school has two rooms and handles K-8. We missed the excitement in the camp while at the store.  A gust of wind came and the two tents next to ours had gone airborne and blown halfway across the camp.  The eating tent had also blown over.  Last night our own tent had nearly blown over, so we had staked down carefully today. [After a very good dinner we were entertained by a local blues guitarist who was wonderful.  Most of these early birds on the ride go to bed by 9:00 pm, so folks gradually wandered off to their tents.  The music was a great way to end the day.]
The day began with breakfast in the Paulina Dance Hall.  It was the best breakfast of the trip.  Several ranch ladies had gathered from miles around.  One said she got up at 3 am and came from 17 miles away.  They joked about their husbands fending for themselves, stumbling around the kitchen looking for food.  Bacon, sausage, eggs scrambled with a light touch and ohhh, the pancakes.  There had to be lots of butter in these and they were light, too. Last year we spent a few days in late fall in Minnesota and Iowa.  On a whim I had eaten pancakes every day for breakfast, looking for the best ones.  They were all very good.  But these ranch ladies from Paulina made the best pancakes I have ever had.  The real triumph though, the brilliant innovation in mass breakfast feeding were the two crockpots.  The first was filled with hot maple syrup.  The second, though, mmmmmmm, the second was filled with melted butter.  A big ladle of melted butter, followed by a ladle of hot syrup.  This is the way to eat pancakes [and definitely the way to become a "big team."]    The ride out of Paulina was brown and treeless.  The route rose slowly until we rounded a curve and saw a long sweeping climb out to our left and then right up to a saddle.  We could see riders 20 or 30 minutes ahead of us.  It was a nice warm up climb for the day.  A short steep downhill and then another short climb.  What followed was one of those great tandem downhills, long and gradual.  The hills were now covered with trees and we had 7-8 miles 30-40 mph speeds.  Fun!!! [Alright, this is for the ladies.  All you guys who are squeamish about female anatomy, skip this section.  I had never done so many miles day after day as by now on this third day of our ride.  My butt bones were killing me.  When I looked ahead to that climb up to the saddle, I wanted to climb out of my saddle and walk.  Oohh, those aching butt bones--the ones that used to have lots of padding on them, but now that I'm over 50, the padding seems to have dropped, or drooped, so the bones just feel naked.  I was desparate, and of course, Bob can feel me squirming around on the back of the tandem.  In mid-squirm, I realized I could kind of lift up my butt, tilt my pelvis forward, and "sit" with my butt bones blissful up off the saddle.  Ah, sweet relief!  I will survive!] The downhill always ends.  A few miles of very gradual uphill through another river valley brought us to Izee.  At least I think it did.  I missed it.  It apparently consists of one abandoned building, a former school.  Izee is on every map I have seen of Oregon and is uninhabited.  Makes me wonder what is actually behind all those little named dots in the rural west. Just after Izee, the big climb started.  We entered the trees soon after the climb started, which made it pretty and provided occasional shade.  The grade was steady, but it was getting hot. We stopped a few times in the shade.  It felt great when we came over the top and had another of those wonderful tandem descents for 3-4 miles to a rest stop.  It felt great to have competed the big climb and we were ravenous.  Ate like pigs at the rest stop.  The OBR does great rest stops. After the rest stop were miles of lightly rolling road running through the ragged edge between pine forest and meadow, eventually coming out at highway 395.  We don't have much country like this in California.  If you are in pine trees there you almost always are going either up or down.  Ahead of us we could see the Strawberry Mountains.    On 395 a short uphill was harder than it should have been because we were beat by now.  Then the summit and a screaming downhill.  We feel a little more confident on the downhills now, but still use the drag brake a good bit.  [This was the descent when we were chased by the big rig, maybe a tanker truck.  The driver was not really chasing us, and was actually giving us some space, but I was nervous.  We were on a fairly steep descent, with a large drop-off to the side into a canyon, and taking quite a few curves.  Tandem riding is not for the meek, particularly when you are on the back and can't see where you're going or do anything about it. I guess this is one of the reasons people say tandem riding is a test of a relationship. But at least if Bob takes us off a cliff, I can have the satisfaction of knowing it was his fault!]     At the bottom of the steep descent, we're riding along a pleasant little creek.  Funny, the road looks like its slightly downhill, but I can feel we're going uphill.  Wait a second, the creek is flowing in our direction!  We stop  and check on the drag brake.  Turns out it's overheated and stuck on.  When it cools a little, the bike starts behaving and we resume our descent.  It's great to see Canyon City and then John Day.  It's been a long day. We reserved a hotel for the two layover nights in John Day and there it is right on the main street.  We roll right up and check in.  Kinda cool to do that on a bike.  [Later we rode a few blocks over to the campground to check on the activities.  Bob got to discuss overheated drag brakes with the bike mechanics who promised to check out the bike for us.  We talked briefly to a young man who was riding solo from Canada to Mexico, and who happened to find our campground.  He appeared to have really bad second degree burns from the sun, and listening to him, we thought the sun might have done something to his mind also.  But then, solo long distance biking probably attracts some unusual folks.  Dinner didn't look too great, so we opted for a restaurant in town.  Ahh...a soft booth to sit in for my sore butt bones, a cold beer, and food served with metal eating utensils.  I felt pampered.  And then a soft bed to sleep in! On the one hand, I felt like a wimp staying in a hotel with all those other folks still out there camping, but...it was great!  We even had a laundry room so we could wash our clothes.] 
The only time during the trip that anyone ever complained about an aspect of the OBR planning happened today.  Wanting to provide another, shorter optional ride, the staff proposed a 30 mile out and back ride to a lake.  They would meet the riders at the lake with lunch.  It turned out they underestimated the difficulty of the climb to the lake and many riders turned back before reaching the lake.  The staff overreached a little in trying to provide the best experience possible and it didn't turn out well.  This was an aberration in an otherwise smoothly run trip.    The highlight of our day was a visit to the Kam Wah Chung Museum.  This museum is a perfectly preserved building and its original contents.  The building was owned by "Doc" Hay, Chinese herbal doctor, who also operated a store and an opium den.  The contents are exactly as they were in the 1940s when Doc Hay had to move to a nursing home.  For instance, an orange still sits on the kitchen shrine, more than 60 years since it was placed there.  Doc Hay had lived in the building since the 1880s.    (Actually, my day had several highlights.  The museum was great, and the woman who hosted us there was as interesting as the building and its story.  She had been dedicated to preserving the museum for over twenty years, and clearly loved the history of the place immensely.  I also enjoyed our lengthy conversation with a ten year old local boy on his bike outside the museum. He was very curious about our tandem.  After grilling us and inspecting our machine thoroughly, he rode off to the fairgrounds to check out the camp full of OBR folks.  In the big city where we live, a local kid wouldn't likely talk to strangers so freely, nor would they likely take the time to talk to him.  Even the folks in the Dairy Queen who served up my milkshake were friendly.)  Who was John Day? I was wondering where the name of the town, John Day, came from.  Here's an explanation from the National Park Service's web site for the John Day Fossill Beds National monument. John Day Fossil Beds National Monument is named after the river and not the man. Still, how was the river named? John Day was born in Culpeper County, Virginia, about 1770. In 1810 he joined an overland expedition to establish a fur trading post at the mouth of the Columbia River. The party became divided and widely separated. Experiencing hardships, John Day's group dwindled to two people. He and Ramsey Crooks eventually reached the mouth of the Mah-hah River along the Columbia. There, a band of American Indians took everything they had, including their clothes. They were rescued and reached Astoria (Oregon) in 1812. Due to this incident, people traveling along the Columbia River would point out the mouth of the river where John Day was robbed. By the 1850's, the Mah-hah River was referred to and renamed the John Day River. If you name the mouth of a river, you name every stretch of it upstream. It appears John Day never came within 100 miles of Sheep Rock. Looks like John Day was famous mostly for getting robbed and never came near the town of John Day.
   It started with 20 or so miles along the John Day River in a fairly broad valley.  Then the road and river plunged into the narrow Picture Rock Canyon.  This was the first time we had ridden through a narrow canyon like this and it was great fun.      The entrance to the canyon is also the beginning of the John Day fossil beds, one of the best fossil hunting areas in the world.  The Fossil Beds visitor center became an unofficial 3rd rest stop as almost every stopped.  The short movie shown was interesting. Having a little background made the remainder of the ride more interesting. Riding though this valley brings back a memory from my childhood.  We had visited Boise and were returning to California via Oregon.  In a summer deluge we had a flat tire on a road just like this, a cliff on the north side of the road, a river on the south side.  Blind curve behind and ahead.  I helped my Dad change the tire in the rain while my mother and brother stayed dry.  My brother also has a sharp memory of this even though he was at most about seven years old.    [We actually finished in the front 25-30% of the pack today, and so we met and talked to lots of different people at the rest stop, on the road and at camp.  We had the chance to talk to the three-legged tandem team, who were strong riders, very friendly and inspirational for us relative newcomers.  We also got our pick of campsites for once, at the high school in Spray, and made it to the store/bar across the street before all the good beer was gone.  Some folks went to the local swimming hole just down the road in Spray, but we were too lazy.  Finishing earlier meant we were putting up the tent earlier, and the heat was oppressive.]    It was good that the riding was easy today.  The heat was bad by the time we reached Spray.  We moved like molasses as we set up our tent.  I didn't know I could move that slowly.  We mostly just sat in the shade through the afternoon.  [The school principal was very friendly and distributed fliers listing "things to do" and places of business in Spray.  I don't think Spray has a traffic light, but it wasn't short on hospitality.  The school was open for us to use the internet if we wanted, and the gym for basketball.  I don't think anyone made it to the gym, but it was a nice gesture.  I think our group probably at least doubled the population of Spray that day.]  Later we wandered over to the little cafe/bar and found a dozen or so other riders there.  Beer.  Air conditioning.  This was good.  The group went through every beer in the place that wasn't Bud, Miller or Coors.  The proprietors allowed as how they didn't usually have so much call for microbrews. 
   At 7:15 we came to Station House where the first climb started.  We stopped and took off our warm clothes and stated the climb.  It was very pretty, a steady grade on a good tree lined road.  We were in the shade of the mountain for a long time and got occasional shade from the trees when the sun got higher.  It was pleasant, but it was very long, 10 miles and 2000 feet.  At just after 9 am we topped the summit and right there was a very welcome rest stop.  [Another woman rider showed me how she wet down her bandanna with ice water and put it around her neck. That did help in the heat.]    It was 10 miles downhill into Fossil and then it was back to climbing.  It's one of those cruel ironies of cycling that you spend forever climbing and then the descent is over in a flash.  The second climb is only 5 miles and 1100 feet.  It's steeper than the others and it's now much hotter.  The trees disappeared about half way down the last descent.  We reach the second summit at about 11:00.    (Note Connie's really red face. It's a really hot day and we've been doing a really lot of climbing!) The descent from the second climb was very pretty through a narrow winding canyon with scattered pine trees and craggy rocks.  The drag brake acted up again and we stopped and sprayed some water from a bottle on it as the mechanic said we could.  It was like spraying water into a hot frying pan.  It sizzled like crazy and then you could see the cable loosening up.  Freed from unwanted drag, we continued the descent out of the trees and into a wide, bone dry valley.  Coming into Clarno, it was like a moonscape, nothing but rocks and dust.  At Clarno, by a river and just before a bridge was the rest stop, within sight of the Clarno grade.  It was 100 degrees and right next to the rest stop a farmer is burning off the stubble in his field.  I could have sworn that was illegal for the last 20 years.  Just the thing to clear your lungs. At the rest stop, everyone was moving very slowly in the heat.  Others were wading into the water.  Wetting down your clothes from the ice water was popular.  In 2s and 3s, people were mounting their bikes and slowly crossing the bridge to begin the climb.  The sag wagon left with a full load.    Finally it was time to move on.  We climbed onto the tandem and crossed the bridge at about 12:45.  4 mph.  Slow going.  Hot.  Stop and rest.  Hot.  Try riding on the leftside, more breeze maybe.  Slow.  Hot.  Stop and rest.  Passed by a group that was in the river last we saw them.  They stop, we pass.  Hot.  Stop.  "Hey!"  someone yelling from ahead, "Rest stop right around the corner!" The rest stop folks had set up an impromptu rest stop, right at the half way point.  They just set up their tent, put out water and sport drink and connected up a battery driven fan.  Oh, were we thankful.  [Actually I think they saved my life.  Well, maybe not literally, but I really doubt I could have finished the climb up the Clarno Grade without this break.  Just to be able to have some ice water to drink and a little shade to stand around in to cool off helped me regain my sense of humor and positive outlook.  It was really, really HOT!  And I grew up in Tucson, Arizona.  But as another Arizonan on the ride had commented a few miles earlier, "In Arizona, we don't go out and ride during the middle of the day!" That same Arizonan reported later that he had checked the temperature reading on his wrist watch as he climbed the Clarno Grade and it had registered 110 degrees.]  We wet everything down and started out again.  We stopped every mile or even sooner.  [The sag wagon guy was attentive and kept driving up and down the hill, stopping at least three times to check on us.  At the back of the pack, in all that heat, our big team on the tandem probably seemed like prime candidates for heat stroke.  We just kept slowly grinding up the hill.]  Finally we could see the saddle and began to count the turns.  When we crested the summit, there was another U-haul, another impromptu rest stop.  Water, bananas and chairs to sit in. [SHADE!!!]  2-3 more riders trickle in.  I used to run marathons a long time ago and I was recently at the finish of the Big Sur Marathon.  I realized then I really missed the atmosphere and comaraderie that comes from having all experienced the same exhausting, draining effort.  That's one reason I wanted to do this ride.  Here it was, sitting in the shade of the truck, eating bananas and laughing with the release of having made it up the climb.  It was literally all downhill from here.   It was the same air of happy exhaustion in Antelope when we got there.  Rolling slowly into town, we see the one cafe.  Let's go in and get whatever they have that's cold!  We can set up camp later.  [As we stumbled toward the cafe, we met a small group of freshly showered riders leaving the cafe to head back to camp.  They asked if we had finished the whole route, and when we said "yes" one of the men looked at us and said "That's not an easy climb.  Several strong tandem teams had to get a ride from the sag wagon today.  You have my respect for finishing."  Whoa! We felt like real tandem riders now.  Wait, we ARE real tandem riders now!] Sitting at the cafe counter, we order the Marionberry Cobbler.  "With ice cream?"  Of course.  The cobbler was wonderful, marionberries are a lot like blackberries and the scoop of ice cream was huge.  The place was run by an older couple, he at the counter and she in the kitchen.  They were very nice.  They had made 70 cobblers and had only 7 left, 5 after we got ours.  I asked if anyone had turned down the ice cream.  "Nope, not a one."  Right after that, Ted came and ordered a cobbler.  "Ice cream?"  "No, thanks."  Oh well, 69 out of 70 ain't bad. This camp ground was the worst.  We camped around the old school, the one that was closed when the Rajneeshies came to town in the '70's.  Since it was closed the grass had died and the gophers had a field day.  It was tolerable though, at least it wasn't rocky.  [I spent some time sitting under a tree with ice on my knees.  By now, they were starting to get pretty sore by the end of the day.  No one else seemed to need any ice treatments, so maybe I still need some adjustments to fit my bike better.  Dinner in camp looked great - grilled salmon -- but since Bob dislikes salmon, we wandered gingerly back to the cafe and indulged in the best burgers west of the Mississippi - or so they seemed after a day on the Clarno Grade.  When we got back to camp, we found speeches in progress in celebration of the last full day of riding.  Then we had entertainment, a vocalist with a keyboard, set up outside the abandoned school in the middle of nowhere.]  [Bill Martin is a great stand up comedian.  He was the best of the entertainment on the tour.] It felt great knowing we had made it through the most difficult day.    [After six days on the road, the ground was getting softer every night and I had no trouble getting a good night's rest.  For the first time on the trip, I awoke in the middle of the night and had to visit the toilet.  In the high desert at 3 am or so, there was not a sound, nor a breath of wind, nor a flicker of light or movement from our 150 or so campers or anywhere in Antelope.  I picked my way to the toilet by moonlight, feeling like my feet crunching on the gravel road were loud enough to wake the dead.  Looking out over the desolate landscape before crawling back into our tent, I knew I was a long way from my suburban home south of San Francisco.  It was perfect.] 
   [Our final rest stop!  I hated to leave, knowing that I would have no more excuse to eat all those great snack foods.  The trip was all about basics:  heat and cold, sleep and wake, eat and drink, pant and pedal, sweat and more sweat.  I didn't lose any weight on the trip, but I built some endurance and muscle, both physical and mental.  And boy did I get to eat a lot!]  We were happy to be done.  At the finish, lunch and the shower truck were waiting.  It's great to be able to get into the car and head off showered and clean. 
Shimano SPD Sandals - These worked great.  They are very comfortable for touring, especially in the heat.  I prefer to wear socks with them.  I use them with Speedplay Frogs.  Some trimming is necessary, but they work after that. Brook B-17 Saddle - I was worried how my butt would hold up over the week.  I think the Brooks saddle helped a lot. Thermarest Camprest LE - We bought these knowing that we do not sleep well on the ground.  Even with our aged bodies, we slept reasonably well on these. Camp Chairs - Since it was a supported tour, everyone had brought folding chairs. The ones we brought could have been more comfortable.  It's worth getting good ones.  Many people had something that would provide shade by their tent.  This could have been really nice. Sleeping - I used a square sleeping bag (45 degree) and a Cocoon sleep sack that was made of polyester.  I used the sleeping back just as a quilt. I was quite comfortable this way and never got cold. Camera - We had a Canon digital S30.  It works fine, and the pictures look very good to me, but it works much better WHEN YOU TAKE IT OUT AND USE IT.  We wish we had taken many more pictures!  The Canon software for uploading the pictures sucks.  It was very difficult to set up and get started.  Once up and running, the usability was OK. Camelbacks - We both used Camelbacks, mine filled with water and Bob's with gatorade.  I put gatorade in my water bottles on the bike.  I did well keeping myself hydrated in the heat, and the Camelback worked great because I could take sips of water frequently without fumbling with a bottle. Skin Aids - SPF45 sunscreen and lots of it!  Lip balm with sunscreen.  Desitin Creamy Zinc Oxide Diaper Rash Ointment (don't laugh - it worked great!) Clothes  - I wore a Solumbra Cycle Shirt from a company called SunPrecautions on several days (but not the days we took any of the pictures in this journal).  The shirt is for sun-sensitive people, so it covers completely but has lots of air vents to cool you off.  I had been a bit skeptical, but found that it worked great.  With long sleeves and a collar, it kept the sun off me but I didn't feel any hotter than when I wore my short sleeved shirts.
The Oregon Bicycle Ride was great.  We would recommend it to anyone, the relative beginner or the 20 year tourist. (For once I agree.  The OBR was great--great people, great scenery, great roads, great food (especially the Marionberry Cobbler), and a great feeling of accomplishment.  Now if we can just find a ride without hot sun, big hills, and hard ground.... I've heard if you ride from the West Coast to the East Coast, the ground gets softer along the way, right?  I think Bob told me that....)
  Blue Ridge Parkway map   
Elevation gain: dunno.
6 snakes 2 squirrels 1 porcupine 1 raccoon on the verge of bursting open and spewing forth obnoxious gases and the like. On the first day (or 1/2 day) of the ride we immediately detoured off the Skyline Drive (because of the aftermath from hurricane Isabelle http://www.noaanews.noaa.gov/stories/s2072.htm) and took to this nasty high-speed highway from hell.  I started noticing (or trying to avoid hitting) one dead critter after another....so after the 2nd squirrel I kept track and asked Dave to do the same.  The tallly of our combined effort is listed above. The next day (ready for more roadkill counting fun) we entered the Skyline and amazingly I didn't see another dead animal....a few dead insects...but no more big critters!  I begain thinking there's probably more wildlife in the park but no road kill??  Why??  I thought about it some more and it came to me.   SPEED!!!  Cars in the park are driving much slower and therefore able to avoid obstacles (or animals) in the road. Lesson:  Slow down....you'll save some lives! Just a quick note on the ride from West Chester, PA to Front Royal, VA....ever ride 3 hours with a couple nuts who've got the entire sound track to the movie Spinal Tap on tape and memorized?  Note to self: "Bring ear plugs next time I ride anywhere with Dave and Suzie!"       
             Suzi was nice enough to drive Bruce and I to the start of the trip, Front Royal, VA.  A long drive, but entertaining for various reasons.  We got all of our gear in order at the spacious Food Lion (Food Weasel to some - Rob, care to tell us why?) and Bruce and I shoved off at 3:30 pm, a nice lazy time.        The highlight of the day was arriving at the northern entrance of the Skyline Drive to learn that it was closed for most of its length due to storm damage from Hurricane Isabel.  I felt "D'oh!" for about a second, then started laughing.  So, we had to ride the nasty, busy, no shoulder Rt 340, which wasn't a pleasant way to start the trip, but at least it wasn't raining.  Yet. Rain came later, along with the discovery that my rear deraileur shifter didn't survive the trip from SLC to Philly unscathed.  It wasn't shifting right, in fact it was stuck in the big cog.  I messed with it for a couple of minutes when Bruce came over, laid his bike-healer hands on the shifter, and voila - problem fixed.  From now on I'm taking my broken bike parts to Bruce for him to fix.  He still won't tell me what he did to fix the shifter.   
Elevation gain: 5,500'.
Dave's Method:  As the time approached to settle down for the night Dave would begin looking ahead for possible spots (maybe within a 1/2 hour of the end of the ride for that day).  He would make this distinct sound like low mumbling if an area ahead looked promising.  The more potential an area had for 5 star camping the louder and more pronounced the sound he would make.  Click on the link below and select documents and "Dave's Campsite Signal.wav" to hear my version of Dave's call for a good campsite.  http://www.msnusers.com/TourDeuxMoser Here is a description of the places we stayed each night that I was on the tour: 1) Open field next to closed flea market.  A little close to the highway and somewhat boggy with these weird glowing bugs crawling on the ground.  Had a few mice nibbling at my head during the night.  Not bad considering it was getting late and we needed a place....fast! 2) Sloped wooded area down a closed fire road, across a stream, and back up the other side; probably the worst camp spot of my part of the trip since I had to dig out several big rocks (with my bare hands) from my sleeping area and I kept sliding down the hill all night long.  Woke up with a really stiff neck! 3) Grassy area behind (or in front) of a closed restaurant overlooking a valley.  Had running water (no hot) and was protected from the wind and rain.  By far the best "free" spot on the trip.  Hoping we'd wake up to a nice sunrise but got rained on instead. 4) Down a secondary road just off the parkway but not far enough away.  Pretty good level ground but weird rental cars passing by us a couple times.  Couldn't get far enough away from the wood "chipper" that started operating shortly before 7:30 in the morning. 5) This one doesn't really count because I "forced" Dave to camp in a paid campsite just outside of Roanoke, VA.  Even after volunteering to pay for the site Dave was still looking around for that perfect "free" site within the state park.  I guess it's hard to go back once you've commited to going "free".  Not much better than day 3...no hot water and a gravel box to sleep on.         
   Once we got on the Skyline Drive, the climbing didn't stop.  I didn't expect it to be a flat ride, in fact I know that total climbing on the 470-mile Blue Ridge Parkway (BuRP) is 48,000', but it's always a shock to climb hills while towing a boat anchor (BOB trailer).  My knees hurt, but that's to be expected.      Skyline Drive is something that every touring cyclist should experience.  35 mph max, no commercial traffic, views abound, smooth surface.  It's so lovely that I can barely even stand it.  The leaves are just starting to change, so I've got that going for me as well.  The trees show quite a bit of damage from Isabel - lots of tree branches stripped bare. When we got to Swift Run Gap, MP 66, it was decision time.  Continue on the closed road, or drop off the parkway and ride busy roads that parallel the Skyline Drive, the whole time dreaming what it'd be like to be riding on the Skyline Drive.  As the "Road Closed" sign didn't say, "This Means You", we continued on the Skyline Drive and loved every second of it.  While on the closed portion we really didn't have any auto traffic, and could ride in whichever lane we pleased. Bruce joined me for the first week of the tour last year, and here he is again for the first week of this trip.  He and I make a good match - we ride at about the same pace and we've been friends for almost ten years.     
Elevation gain: 4,077'.
I wanted to write to let Dave (and everyone else) know why his trailer is so heavy.  Please click on the link below and download the list of items that Dave sent to me prior to starting the trip.  http://www.msnusers.com/TourDeuxMoser Dave....this is why your beast is so heavy.  Reduce and reuse! It was actually somewhat amusing that I even volunteered a few times to ride the hog up some of those steep inclines.  Dave and I have the same pedals so it was easy to take turns on the "other" bike.  It took me only two days of saying "I'll ride the hog" that I got smart and kept my mouth shut and on my ass on my bike.  Plus I could only ride that thing up hill....down hill scared me to death! Day 3 was an incredible experience because we got to ride a stretch of the Skyline without any cars!  Beats single file on a busy highway.  It pretty cold up on the ride and for the next several days unseasonably cool weather was on it's way.  The highlight of this segment of the ride was stopping off at the SkyLand Rest Area and getting a big cup of coffee and a sweet cinnamon roll....lowlight was going back outside again and freezing my ass off changing into my long sleeve shirt and vest.               
  See, if you leave the Parkway to go to a town, you're going to drop at least 1,000' of elevation gain.  Sure, it's a fun downhill, but then you have to turn right around and ride up the hill after stuffing your face at the grocery store.  Best to stay on the Parkway and eat mac'n'cheese than drop off of it and have a better selection of food.        The BuRP is kind of like the Skyline Drive, it follows the crest of the Appalachian Mountains, but there are some differences.  The BuRP feels sort of abandoned, like a thing that people just don't do anymore for entertainment.  Maybe back in the 40's or 50's it was the thing to do, but now it's kinda deserted.  That's fine - close it to auto traffic!  Hikers and bicyclists only! We camped beside a restaurant that closed due to lack of business.  Actually, tonight's campsite was great: level ground, a view, a restroom with running water nearby.  Cheap thrills on a bike tour.    As an appetizer, Bruce at a whole can of salmon.  I had a little bit, but it just didn't taste right to me.  I was impressed by how much salmon Bruce ate - I think it was nearly a pound of salmon.  Pass.    The weather has been cool, partly cloudy, with rain off and on.  Clothing is a challenge - put on the fleece for the downhill, take it off for the uphill, short finger or long finger gloves?, etc. Bruce and I are riding the Skyline Drive and the BuRP without the only book written specifically for bike touring along these roads.  Yes, I own this book, but some big jerk didn't return it to me before Bruce and I shoved off.  Hey big jerk, you know who you are, I'm charging you $0.50 for each day that I ride without that book. On that note, Cheers!     
Elevation gain: 4,200'.
   The ride was somewhat short but very scenic off the BRP and down to Buena Vista.  The best part was watching Dave try to negotiate the ~2,000 feet elevation loss and all those hairpin turns with his BOB all going about 40mph!  T'was a good thing we weren't across the center line when that dump truck was coming the other direction, half-way into our side of the road.      Show links to this Hide links to this      We did indeed stuff our "pie" holes in Buena Vista....I got so excited with all the food that I bought more than I could fit on my bike so I had to get "creative with the corn."  The checkout lady made a comment about the type/amount of food I had saying that "she would have to have a big glass of water to get any of it down."  Hmmm....  I had no choice (because of the lack of room) but to eat several things before we starting riding again...including an entire box of powdered donuts!  Boy was it hard to ride for awhile but my stomach loosened up.   
       In Buena Vista we stuffed our faces with cottage cheese, yogurt, a whole box of Krispy Kreme powdered mini-donuts (I made Bruce laugh when he had a whole mouth full of donuts and powder flew everywhere - I think some even came out his nose, it was classic), Doritos, etc.  After that we were feeling a bit sluggish while battling traffic along Rt 510, but we both made it to James River unscathed.      James River is the lowest point along the Burp at 649'.  From there it climbs to 3,950', the highest point along the BuRP in Virginia, in 14 miles.  Even though we were energized by the box of donuts, we didn't climb all 3,300' as we had already climbed 3,000' by the start of the climb.  We climbed 1,200' to save the remaining 2,100' for the next morning. A funny moment: at the James River Visitor's Center I asked the lady at the info desk if there was a phone that we could use at the VC.  She responded by writing the VC's phone # on my map.  Bruce and I looked at each other, baffled.  I asked her again, and she said no, then went back to reading her book.  OK.
Elevation gain: 5,117'. I probably won't get a chance to update the website for a while as I'll be riding along a stretch of the BuRP with minimal services.  In fact, my next stop here in Roanoke is to head to the Food Weasel to buy four days worth of food.  Well, that'll be fun to carry! Also, check out "The Route" page for a link to the Blue Ridge Parkway map, if yer interested.
   As fate would have it I ended up having a potentially trip ending break on my bike.  The wind had really kicked up that night and just before dusk a big gust of wind blew my bike over...ironically I was sitting close enough to reach out and grab it but instead I just watched it go down to a loud crunching sound.  At first I thought my sunglasses broke but upon further inspection the bike had landed smack dab on my front shifter permanently forcing it into the "little ring."  See entry for Dave for a song about my little ring!          Not sure how this came about in our conversations but Dave was somewhat infatuated with the ingredients from a canned meat product from Armour called "Potted Meat Food Product."  So to push it one step further I decided to buy some and eat it in front of him....I told him "tastes like chicken!"  I said I was going to make a poem about the ingredients but instead I'll just list them below in order of appearence on the label (for those that are really interested here's a web site that has everything you wanted to know about the subject and more http://www.shipbrook.com/jeff/potted.html).  My ingredients differ slightly in that mine had more "real" chicken. - Mechanically Separated Chicken - Beef Tripe - Partially Defatted Cooked Beef Fatty Tissue - Beef Hearts - Water - Partially Defatted Cooked Pork Fatty Tissue - Salt - Sodium Erythorbate and Sodium Nitrite   
       The BuRP near Roanoke isn't quite as pleasant as the rest - it passes right near the town, it's busy, and there's more trash alongside the road.  Basically, it's just like any other two-lane blacktop in the U.S. Right before reaching camp, I had myself a little ol' accident.  Bruce and I were just riding along on a flat stretch of road, nice and slow, when all of a sudden the rig veered off the road and onto the grass.  I suspect The Pig is responsible for the move.  So, instead of stopping on the grass (I still don't know why I didn't just do that), I tried to steer back onto the road but the front wheel didn't want to get up and over the 2" lip of the road.  The bike and The Pig fell down onto the pavement and I kinda ran off the bike.  It was kinda funny - the bike stopped and I ran ahead of it for a few steps, shaking my fist at it.  I wasn't hurt, the bike is fine, but it still wasn't pretty.  A D'oh! moment.      At camp Bruce ate a whole can of Potted Meat Food Product.  I couldn't watch him do it, in fact I had to stand away from him while it was happening.  I think he was intrigued by the combination of mechanically separated chicken and partially defatted cooked pork fatty tissue.  Regardless, this is what he had to say after he polished off the can: "I figure, what the hell, you're gonna die of something someday, it might as well be a potted meat product."    Set to the music of "Little Wing" by Jimi Hendrix (Bruce can explain in more detail): Well he's riding, trees aboundOn the Blue Ridge Parkway, no traffic soundLast night, burritos, we're campin'Starin' to spaceWhat were we talkin' about? Then a gust of wind Bruce's bike blew over in the breezeIt fell down hard on some old dead treesIt's not alright, he says, it's not alrightHis front shifter broke in three. Now he's in the little ring. For the rest of this journeyWhether he likes it or not, he's stuck in his little ringIt's alright, I say, it's alrightIt's all up and down anyway
Elevation gain: 3,500'. In downtown Roanoke Bruce turned right to go to the airport to get a rental car for the quick drive back to Philly, and Dave turned left to shower at the YMCA (he doesn't shower much), update the website, and buy four day's worth of food.  After that, Dave headed out of town, got back on the BuRP the hard way (the road out of Roanoke didn't exactly intersect with the BuRP, it went under it, so there was a portage involved), and continued southwest on his merry way, where he'll stop referring to himself in the third person.
   Dave was curious about the bivy sack the whole trip so we ended up trading for the night...Dave in the bivy and me in the tent.  The next morning I asked Dave how the sack treated him and he said "never again!"  I guess it was a little too cramped and claustrophobic.  I actually stayed warmer in the sack than the tent just becuase there is less air to heat between your body and the outside....unlike a tent!  Sorry Dave.  The only bummer with a bivy sack would be if you had to hang out in there for extended periods of time like in the rain.    I really regret that I couldn't have continued on with Dave and I'll say it again...I will go back and finish the BRP!  It was an amazing ride (for the short time I participated) and one that I'd recommend in a heart beat to any biking enthusiast looking for some fun and adventure!
So, Bruce has left me again, the second time in two years, to finish the rest of the Tour by myself.  I'm sure it'll take a couple of days to adjust to riding solo.  I think I can manage, although I'd rather have him along, broken front shifter and all.      Today was the $20 bill day.  I went to the YMCA to shower.  Showers are $1, I offered the lady at the front desk a $20, expecting $19 in change, and she let me have the shower for free - she didn't want to break the bill.  OK.  Then, on the way out of town, I filled up the stove fuel bottle with $0.07 of unleaded.  Again, I offered the $20 bill, and the gas station attendant let me have the gas for free.  I wonder how much other stuff I can get for free by offering a $20 bill?  Stay tuned! During the major climb of the day (1,400') I was joined by a road biker out for a ride.  Even though he was on a superlight bike and could've easily gone twice my pace, he slowed down to my pace and we chatted until the top of the climb.  There, he turned around to head back to Roanoke and I continued on my way along the BuRP.  Riding with him definitely made the climb seem shorter.      Tonight I'm camped in the middle of a big grassy field, just the kind of spot that Bruce was looking for the last night of his ride.     
Elevation gain: 6,322'. Ouch. As today is a Saturday, the BuRP was busier than usual, which means there was a car every two minutes instead of every five minutes.  Lots of rich white couples tearing around in big, new SUVs.  I stopped at Mabry Mill for lunch, and it was swarming with people.  After this one guy saw that I was bicycling, he told me with a straight face that yup, it's gonna rain all day.  It was 1:30 pm, and it hadn't rained a drop.  I asked him when it was going to let up, and he said by tomorrow morning.  Thank goodness!            As I was just riding along (JRA) today, a chipmunk darted out from the side of the road and ran right underneath me.  I don't know if he ran between my front wheel and my rear wheel, or my rear wheel and The PIg's tire, but it was one of those, and it was crazy.  I didn't even have time to react, which was probably a good thing. Tonight I'm staying at the BuRP Hostel.  It's run by a 82-year old guy named Alex, and like most hostels, it's definitely unique.  I stayed at the hostel for two reasons: to meet and talk to other travelers, and to read through the guestbook which was sure to have entries from other bike tourers.  Well, no one else was there except a retired German guy named Detlev that arrived late and left early, and Alex doesn't keep a guestbook because, as he says, "What would I do with it?  Too much stuff!"  However, the views from the common room of the hostel are superb, all forest, good sunset and sunrise (I saw 'em both!).    It's rainy country - Alex said that it's already rained 47" here since the beginning of the year, already exceeding the annual 46" average.  Yikes.
Elevation Gain: 5,210'. Last night I didn't sleep so well.  Detlev wasn't snoring or anything like that, but it was just so quiet in the hostel, with no window to crack!  As David St. Hubbins has said (and probably read): "The hush was almost deafening!" Alex, the hostel owner, came up to the hostel (it's the second story of his two-story house, he and his wife live on the first floor) to say hi.  He sat down and asked, "So, what's happening in the world today?", which lead to a really stupid, long discussion about, well, everything that's happening in the world today.  We touched on politics, economics, agriculture, world trade, corporate downsizing, and the whole thing left me feeling like I wanted to just get on my bike and ride, which I did.    This morning my legs weren't feeling 100% after yesterday's big day, and the sunrise was so nice, and the common room was so pleasant, and I was listening to Weekend Edition on NPR, that I didn't start riding until 10 am.  A nice, lazy Sunday morning. During the ride I stopped at the Northwest Trading Post, and was amazed at the density of schnick-schnocks and bric-a-brac in that place.  It was almost suffocating.      I'm looking forward to buying food from a grocery store tomorrow - it's been a few days since I've seen one of those, and I'm getting a bit tired of eating just pasta, Pop Tarts, oatmeal, and - dare I say it - Snickers!  Oh, the horror!  I want yogurt!  Bananas!  Perishable items! At camp I was shocked to turn on the radio and hear the Cubs playing.  The Cubs - in October!?!  I don't follow baseball much, but after living in the Chicagoland area for a while during high school, I know that the Cubs playing in the playoffs is a big deal.     
   The ride: Continued southwest on the BuRP from The Lump (MP 264) to Linville Falls (MP 316), with a minor detour to Blowing Rock for groceries. Elevation gain: 5,370'.      After a few days on the road without a grocery store, today's lunch never tasted so good.  I ate a pound of cottage cheese at the Food Lion in Blowing Rock, among other things.    The leaves are gettin' really good, lots of color.  Near Grandfather Mountain (MP 302), they were spectacular.        Found a great campsite at Linville Falls, in the picnic area.  It's right by the Linville River, so I'll have that babbling at me all night.  The best part: the floor of the tent is level tonight.  No more sliding downhill.    Blue Ridge Parkway Fact-of-the-Day: The Blue Ridge Mountains are four times older than the Alps.
Elevation gain: 6,245'. Oof. That's a bunch over only 40 miles.            During today's ride I saw a little orange salamander crossing the road.  He was so cute - only about 2" long and he was taking his sweet time getting across the road.  It was moving so slow that I thought it was plastic until, of course, I saw it move.    Tonight I'm camped at about 5,000', near the base of the climb to Mt. Mitchell.  The site is great - it's about 1/2 mile off the BuRP, level grassy ground, trees all around, all that.  It's really foggy here.  Smoky mountains, indeed.      Stopped in Little Switzerland for lunch today - how could I not?  The grocery store has basically two things for sale: candy bars and wine.  The other funny thing about that town is that none of the buildings look Swiss.  Hmm. Math Quiz of the Day: If my descending speed is five times my climbing speed (in road miles per hour) and my average speed for the day is 11 mph, what are my descending and climbing speeds?  Assume that my starting and ending elevations for the day are the same, the road distance climbing equals the distance descending, and that I'm only either climbing at a constant speed or descending at a constant speed all day.  The first one to post the correct answer in the Guestbook receives, uh, a prize!  Good luck.
Elevation gain: 1,910' plus all the hills that I rode in Asheville. It was nice climbing up Mt. Mitchell without The Pig in tow.  It went really quick, and was one of the easier climbs of the trip.  Couldn't see a darn thing from the top, though, as the fog had a firm grip on the hills.          Rode into Asheville, and that's when the D'oh!s began: 1. I planned on today being sort of a rest day, with most of the riding downhill, but when I saw the hills around Asheville, D'oh! 2. First thing, take a shower (I don't shower much).  I went to the YMCA only to find out that they don't offer showers.  But the YWCA does, on the other side of town.  D'oh! 3. After doing a load of laundry in the washer at a laundromat, I turned around to find that all of the dryers were in use.  D'oh! 4. I went to UNCA to update the website at the computer lab, but the lab was closed since it's fall break.  D'oh! 5. Riding around UNCA, I had a nasty case of chain suck when shifting to the largest cog.  The chain wedged itself between the cassette and the spokes.  D'oh!  That hasn't happened to me on that bike on probably five years.  Of course I blamed the new rear shifter that I had just installed that day. 6. Went to the Asheville library to update the website, only to find out that (1) it's $2 for non-residents (D'oh!), and (2) it's a 45-min. wait (D'oh!). 7. When I was unlocking my bike at the library to leave Asheville and its many D'oh!s, I noticed something funny with my spokes on my rear wheel.  Not good.  One of the spokes tore its eyelet out of the rim when I had chain suck earlier in the day.  The spoke didn't break, but the rim was in bad need of replacement.  D'oh!  So, I called up the same bike shop that I was at earlier in the day.  They were about to close, but the mechanic there (Ben) said he'd stay late and replace the rim for me.  Very cool, but on the ride to the bike shop I was wondering what type of rim he'd have for me - the one I had was stouter than a typical rim, for towing the trailer.  Well, he had a downhill mountain bike rim that worked great. The scary thing about the rim that blew up is that at each of the drive side eyelets, there was a small crack in the rim running along the length of the rim.  It's a good thing that the rim decided to blow up in Asheville, with its seven bike shops, instead of, say, Little Switzerland or B.F.E., Tennessee.      Ben finished replacing and truing the rim at about 7 pm, and asked where I was staying for the night.  I hadn't really thought of it, I was more worried about the rim, but he offered his couch for me to crash on at his place.  Southern hospitality at its finest.  As a thank-you for staying late to replace the rim, we went out to eat at a great restaurant.  Then we drank a few beers and watched "American Movie" with his roommate.  For some reason, I liked that movie way better this time than the first time I saw it.    So, the day ended on a great note.  Asheville is a cool town, reminds me a lot of Portland, OR with its rain, good beers, and hills.  I even admire it's D'oh!s now.
The Ride: Left Asheville through the Biltmore Forest, a great road with big houses to gawk at and hardly any traffic, then hooked back up with the BuRP.  Rode that through Mt. Pisgah to camp (at 5,500'). Elevation gain: 5,245'. During the ride I talked to three other bike tourers who were headed north.  Each had a BOB trailer.  One guy had a Surly Karate Monkey bike, a mountain bike with 29" wheels.  It was funny seeing that setup because that's basically the bike that Ben (yesterday's bike mechanic) said he'd want to ride on a bike tour.      At Mt. Pisgah, the top of a major climb, I had a tough time warming up.  It was fine when I was on the bike and working, but when I stopped, all that sweat started drying and cooling me off, a bit too much.  It was fine when I got back on the bike and started riding again.    On the way to Mt. Pisgah I saw a big, red crawdad crossing the road.  At 3,300' elevation.  Only in North Carolina.    At camp I had an appetizer of kippered snacks and crackers.  Ben's roommate, who was our waiter at the restaurant last night, gave me a whole Ziploc bag full of crackers, so I put those to good use.  Found a good site for camp as well - in a beautiful red spruce tree forest, right off the BuRP.    Tonight at camp, I was listening to the radio and heard a guy talking about trans fats and how he thinks they're linked to hyperactivity.  Does that mean that if I eat more Fritos Corn Chips, I'll be more active and be able to ride farther each day?  Well, only one way to find out! The mileposts along the BuRP are triangular concrete posts.  The one for milepost 420 was missing, which was sort of frustrating because I knew the top of a steep climb was at milepost 420.2, so I kept looking for 420 and was confused when I started going downhill without seeing it.  Then I remembered the hippie, crunchy, stoner town that I just left (Asheville), and it all made sense as to why the milepost marker was missing.
Elevation gain: 1,235'. Today's ride was mostly downhill.  Last night I was camped at 5,500', I had a few rolling hills to the highest point of the BuRP (6,047'), then it was C.F.A. all the way to Waynesville.  It didn't rain as hard today as it did yesterday, but it still rained a little.  Mostly it was just foggy, really foggy.          Leaving the quiet, pleasant, scenic BuRP for busy, four-lane divided Rt 23/74 was shocking.  Lots of trucks, fast traffic, wow. In Waynesville I'm staying with my Aunt Juanita and Uncle Joe.  When I got there, at about 11:30 am (nice and early), it was all business with laundry, showering, updating the website, drying out my stuff from the previous night's all-night rain, etc.  Then the four grandkids showed up (Teri and Carl's kids), some with friends, and they kept me busy until dinner playing rollerblade soccer, talking, etc.  After dinner the kids left for friend's houses, and we grownups sat around and watched the Cubs, talked some more, that kind of thing.  It was great to see the whole gang again, especially outside of a big hairy family gathering.          Before dinner I was working on my bike, greasing the chain, checking the brakes, etc. when I noticed something goofy with the rear cassette - the big cog wasn't spinning round, it was more elliptical.  Turns out that the chain suck I had in Asheville bent the big cog in back, so now it's not exactly round.  Should be ok (famous last words?), as I shouldn't have to use that gear much between here and Chicago as it's the lowest gear on the cassette.
Elevation Gain: 5,464'. Despite the Weather Channel's nasty, rainy forecast for the day, I didn't get rained on.  The fog was thick in spots, but I managed to dodge the rain, which is always a good thing. The last six miles of the BuRP were the best of the whole 469-mile road.  Why?  Well: 1. It was just the right grade for me to maintain a coasting speed of 35 mph without using the brakes. 2. The curves weren't too tight, but it was curvy enough to keep the scenery changing and the riding interesting, bordering on challenging. 3. The colors, oh the leaf colors.  Thinking back, I don't know how I managed to keep my eyes on the road. 4. It was the last six miles of the big, long, hilly BuRP, so it felt good to be near the end. 5. Hardly any traffic, even though it was a Saturday.  I think the weather forecast kept the crowds away. 6. No rain, no fog, no wind, dry road, about 65 deg. F.              So, that's why.  Contrast that with the nasty ride through GSMNP.  I've never seen so much traffic, and it was a twisty uphill (granny gear) road with no shoulder.  I found out later that most of the traffic was due to the Tennessee - Georgia football game (Hubba Ho! Shanks Akimbo!) in Knoxvile that was starting about an hour after I hit all that traffic.  D'oh! At around 3:30, after almost being run off the road by an RV, I decided to find camp and finish the climb to the pass the next day, which should hopefully be less busy.   
       The Ride:  Continued northwest on Rt 441 to the top of the road at Newfound Gap (5,048'), then descended into Tennessee, turned west onto Little River Road, northwest on Rt 73 for a bit to Townsend, then hopped on Rt 321 west through Walland and Maryville to Friendsville. Elevation gain: 3,000'. The descent from Newfound Gap was a hair-raiser.  40 mph easy, leaves falling, wet and twisty roads, all that.  Little River Road was a pleasant, scenic ride if you don't count the people yelling and honking at me.  Here's what I don't understand:  if you're in a hurry, why drive along a twisty 30 mph road when there's another parallel road that'll get you there much faster?  And why yell and honk at a bicyclist that's going 22 mph (it was slightly downhill, following a river)?  I noticed that most of the people that were honking or yelling had plates from out of state, or had either a "God Bless America" or "United We Stand" bumper sticker / window decal.      Found a great campsite, in an open field, no traffic noise, with a great view of Ft. Loudoun Lake.  It was nice and relaxing reading my book and watching boat traffic on the lake.   
The Ride: Continued west on Rt 321 through Lenoir City, then turned north on Rt 95 to Oakridge, then west on Rt 62 through Oliver Springs and Coalfield to Wartburg.    Today I rode over the Charles Deadrick "Pete" Johnson memorial bridge, so I've got that going for me. Lots of bramble and run down houses along the ride today.  I heard a wild pig snorting in the bramble, which added to the creepy viney feel. Wartburg is a great little town, I like the vibe.  Found a great campsite, right next to a run down barn.  I've got a tin roof over my head, which might come in handy with the forecasted rain for tonight.      Show links to this Hide links to this     
Thanks, Suzi, for the apples.  I ate one at the post office and packed the rest - they just might make it to camp! The Ride:  Rode north on Rt 27 out of Wartburg through Sunbright to Elgin, where I turned west on Rt 52.  Rode that through Rugby and Allardt to Rt 127, which I took north through Pall Mall, Static, and into Kentucky to Albany. Rain is the word of the day.  The first 25 miles or so were pleasant, no rain but overcast skies, and then all hell broke loose.  I had to seek shelter inside a barn near the road for about 1-1/2 hours because (a) it was dangerous to ride with all the truck traffic and heavy rain, and (b) the rain was stinging my face.  My face is on fire, indeed!  If the rain let up at all, the wind picked up, and it was a headwind.    Today was just plain difficult, both physically and mentally.  After I left the barn and started riding again, my calf muscles were cramping up from sitting still for so long.  Not good.  Also, from today on, I'll be getting my daily mileages from MapQuest as my computer blew up in all the rain.  D'oh! But, after all that tough riding, the day ended on a great note.  I found a great place to camp inside a barn with some tobacco drying, my camp stuff stayed dry inside The Pig, the burritos tasted particularly good after such a tough day, and the sunset was just plain spectacular.         
The Ride:  From Albany I rode west on lovely quiet roads (1590, 1351, 449, 61, 953, 214, 100) to Tompkinsville, where I hooked up with Rt 63 and rode that northwest into Glasgow.    Had my first flat of the Tour today.  I was all ready to go at 8 am when I saw that the front tire was flat - D'oh!  Oh well, I was due. The highlight of the day was taking a ferry across the Cumberland River.  Didn't know it was there until I almost rode right into the river.  Two guys drive the ferry back and forth across the 50 ft. wide river all day.    As I was tooling along at about 15 mph, just minding my own business, a black cat jumped out of the bramble alongside the road and crossed in front of my path - it missed my front wheel by about a foot.  Good thing I'm not superstitious.  Or am I? One of the many differences between cows and horses: when a horse is eating grass and hears me riding by, he looks up but keeps chewing, like it's no big deal - I'm just a bike.  When a cow hears me, it looks up but stops chewing, looking all stupid with gobs of grass sticking out of its mouth.  Duh. There is just not much daylight at this time of year.  When I finally left Glasgow to look for camp, it was only about 45 minutes until sunset.  I found a spot, behind a church way outside of town, and hustled to set up the tent and make dinner before it was pitch black.  Then, of course, I heard the Cubs lose on the radio.  D'oh!  The curse continues?       
The Ride:  Continued north on Rt 90 to Cave City, where I headed into Mammoth Cave National Park via Rt 70 and 255.  From there I exited the park on Green River Ferry Road (RT 1352) and continued west on Rts 1827 and 728 until Rt 259.  I took Rt 259 north through Bee Spring, Anneta, Meredith, and Leitchfield to Rt 737, which I took northwest.  I hooked back up with Rt 259 for a bit and then went nothwest on Rt 105 to camp. I spent some time at the visitor's center at Mammoth Cave, but didn't go on an organized tour because (1) I've seen the caves before, apparently, but only have a hazy memory of the trip, so uh ... (2) steep admission price (3) each tour was about 2 hours long, and with daylight in such short supply, that's a lot, and most importantly (4) it was SUCH a beautiful day for riding that I couldn't spend even part of it underground.  Now, if it were raining, I probably would've taken multiple tours of the cave.    Got to ride another ferry today, this one across the Green River.  The ferry operator told me a funny story about a bicycle tourer whose chain broke right when he pedaled off the ferry.  Funny because it wasn't me, I suppose.      Had a couple big, black, barking, snarling dogs orbiting me for about 30 scary seconds today.  They stopped not because of my screams and shouts, but because they were far down the road and didn't want to have to walk too far back home.  Yikes. The forecast is for rain tonight, so I'm glad I found the campsite that I did - a nice grassy meadow without any trees above me to drip rain water on me even after the rain stops.  And, the best part, it's down a gravel road with a chain across it. At camp I listened to the Red Sox get beat by the Yankees.  Oh joy, what a surprise, the Yankees are in the World Series.  Boy, that'll be exciting and different. Here you go (you asked for it): Math Quiz-of-the-Day:  If my power output drops from 150 watts at the start of the day to 75 watts at the 100th mile of the day in proportion to the square of the distance, and my speed drops linearly from 16 mph at the start of the day to 12 mph at mile 100, how many regular-sized Snickers bars do I need to eat to ride 80 miles in a day?  Assume the following: - The rate of change of power output with respect to distance at mile 100 is zero.- My piehole-to-pedal efficiency is 25% (the remaining 75% is spent yelling at pursuing dogs, thinking about math quizzes, oohing and aahing at leaves of color, etc).- My only food/fuel input is Snickers bars. The first one to post the correct answer in the Guestbook wins a prize, if they want it, of course.  Round your answer off to the nearest tenth of a Snickers bar - yes, it's possible to eat only part of a Snickers bar, but that doesn't happen too often.  Good luck!   
The Ride:  Continued north on Rt 105 from McQuady to Rt 60, which I took west to Hawesville.  There I crossed the big bridge over the Ohio River into Indiana, and got my kicks on Rt 66 into Tell City, where I refueled.  After having a great conversation with a local couple at the grocery store in Tell City, I headed east on Rt 37 for a bit, then took Rt 145 north through Bristow, Sassafras, Birdseye and Riceville to Patoka Lake.          Today's hills were steeper than any I've ridden so far on the tour.  On about five of them (by the way, none of these were over a 1/4 mile long, so it wasn't that bad) I was switchbacking in the lowest gear, and on one doozy, the final climb to Birdseye, I was out of the saddle in the lowest gear.  Yikes.  So much for looking forward to Indiana's flat roads.  I have a feeling that they'll flatten out quite nicely further north.    Tonight's campsite is great - I've got a nice view of the lake, but I had to work for it.  I couldn't get around the Keep Out No Trespassing Private Property gate (pesky gates!), so I had to portage the bike and The Pig over the gate.  As I was swinging my trailing leg over the gate, my foot got caught on a wire and I went down.  Oof!  Not too hard, but the wire did draw a little blood on my ankle.       
The Ride:  Rode north from Patoka Lake on Rt 145 through French Lick to Prospect, where I turned east on Rt 150.  I passed through Abydel then hit Paoli, where I turned north on Rt 37 and rode that through Orleans, Mitchell, Tarry Park and Bedford to Bloomington.        Orleans proudly declares, via a roadside sign, that it's the home of the Indiana State Soils Champions for a few years in the 90's.  Wow! I got to Bloomington at around 3 pm, rode around the campus for a bit, then rode around town with a stop at a bike shop that has the coolest air pump I've ever seen.  This weekend is the Hilly Hundred bike ride - 50 miles on both Saturday and Sunday.  It's not a race, more of a RAGBRAI-style ride.  A guy at the bike shop suggested that I stay in town the next day and ride it.  My twisted line of thinking: "Hmm, maybe I should take a day off of the tour and do the ride.  My legs could use a rest!"  Duh.    Bloomington is a great town.  Although, the weather may have influenced the experience - it was one of those clear, crisp, cool fall afternoons.  Lots of people were walking around, the trees were all colorful on campus, and the shops near campus were lively.
The Ride:  Rode NW out of Bloomington on Rt 46 through Ellettsville, Spencer, Vandalia, and Bowling Green to Rt 59, which I took north through Ashboro, Brazil, Mansfield and Bellmore.  At Rt 236 I turned west through Guion and Marshall, then turned right on Rt 41 to Turkey Run SP. Today was a cloudless, windless, 65 deg. F day.  Doesn't get much better than that for bike touring. After Bowling Green, the hills finally eased up and cornfields became the typical scenery.  Quite a difference from last year, though - last year the cornstalks were green (July / August), now they're all brown.      Ladybugs abounded today.  After cicadas, they have to be the clumsiest flyers I've ever seen.  I'd see them in the air in front of me as I was riding and I'd have no idea if I was going to hit one or not until the last second - very erratic flying.  Also, I learned that it's tough to get by breathing through just my nose while riding since I had to keep my mouth closed or else a ladybug would be sure to fly in.    Found a flat, grassy, open spot for camp tonight, a good site.   
Today was all about the wind.  I woke up and it was windy, but I couldn't tell which direction it was blowing as it was kinda swirly at camp.  So, I rode to the library in Attica to plan out the next few days of riding - I was planning on riding generally west then north to get to St. Charles, to avoid the mess around Chicago as much as I could.  That's when I learned that the wind would be 25 mph out of the southwest today, and 25 mph out of the northwest tomorrow.  Seeing as how I really don't enjoy riding into a headwind, I decided to ride as far north as I could today, taking advantage of the tailwind, then have the last two days be unavoidably into the headwind but not too far of a distance. After I left the library, it was just stupid fast for most of the rest of the day.  The only time I wasn't riding at least 20 mph was when I had to ride northwest for a bit between Atkinson and Earl Park - that's when I had a crosswind from hell.  I was leaning way left to counter the wind, to maintain a straight line, but when a truck would pass it was always a bit dicey (the road was a four-lane divided highway). When a truck would pass, even if they got over into the left lane after seeing my hand signals (I was looking in my rear view mirror a lot) the effect was huge - the wind would cut out when they were passing me and I'd veer left since I was already leaning way left into the wind, then I'd straighten out just in time for them to finish passing, when the wind would come back and I'd get blown to the right. I'm sure it looked funny from behind.  A couple of times, when I saw that a truck wasn't going to get over into the left lane, I'd have to stop and stand with both feet on the ground and hunch over just to stay upright in the strong gusts of wind.  Yikes. Now, that crosswind only happened for a 12-mile stretch - the other 110 miles was spent perma-smile flying down the road with a strong tailwind.  You know you've got a strong tailwind when you're pedaling easy in your second-to-highest gear, you spit off to the side - and your spit takes the lead! It was an unseasonably hot day - the high temperature was 85 deg F.  I drank all three liters of water in my CamelBak and had to fill up along the way with some nasty sulfury water from a gas station that I really didn't want to drink, but had to in order to stay somewhat hydrated.  And, the Snickers in my black rear pack melted - imagine that, on a 85 deg sunny day!    When I finally reached Schererville, the sun was about to set and I still needed to get food for dinner.  I sped to the grocery store, checked my messages really quick (no, Stinky Pants, I still haven't had a chance to get through ALL of yours, but I'm sure you'll enjoy knowing that I was running out of time to get to camp and said "D'oh!" when I heard that I had eight messages), grabbed some food, and rode west down Rt 30 from the big nasty intersection of Rt 30 and Rt 41, wondering what kind of camp I'd find for the night. Well, I found a great spot.  I camped in a grove of trees right next to some cornfields.  The sun hadn't quite set yet and I had the tent set up and the stove going - ok, good, I can eat then go to sleep.  Right when I started cooking dinner I saw a guy round a corner on his ATV and look at me.  I waved hi, he rode over, I asked him if it's ok if I camp here, he said no, and I thought, wow, now what?  It was his uncle's property that I was camped on, but when he learned that I wasn't planning on camping there for two weeks, that I was on a bike tour, and that I wasn't going to shoot him, he said it was ok.  We introduced ourselves (his name's David, and his friend Rob (Ron?) showed up later), then we talked for about an hour about this and that, mostly about either bike touring or bow hunting for deer (the arrows are so sharp that they usually go right through the deer!), which David does on the 100 acres that his uncle owns.  It was weird to be camped on this beautiful 100-acre land, with deer and geese everywhere, and it's located right next to the big, nasty intersection of Rts 30 and 41.
The Ride:  Continued west on Rt 30 through Dyer into Illinois, where I turned west on the Sauk Trail Road.  I rode that through Sauk Village and South Chicago Heights to Park Forest, where I joined the Old Plank Road Trail, a rail trail, and rode that west through Frankfort to New Lenox.        In New Lenox I'm staying with my cousin Cathy.  She has a shower at her big fancy house, and as I hadn't showered since Kentucky (I don't shower much), you can best believe that I showered at her place.   Today was a short easy ride - the trees alongside the rail trail blocked most of the wind, so it was relatively easy cruising.  It was fun hanging out with Cathy and her daughter Elizabeth for the afternoon.  Elizabeth wants to be a butterfly fairy princess for Halloween (she's three), but when she learned that her friend Megan, who is four, is going to be a cheerleader for Halloween, Elizabeth declared that she wants to be a butterfly fairy princess cheerleader instead.  Ok, so a wand in one hand, a pom pom in the other ...    After eating dinner (Elizabeth loves to slurp spaghetti, and she declares that she's good at it), Cathy and I hung out, talked, and watched the World Series.  A nice lazy day, which was a welcome change.
   Show links to this Hide links to this      The Ride:  Rode west on Laraway from New Lenox to Rt 52, which I took northwest for a bit to Briggs Road.  Rode that north through Joliet and Lockport to Rt 7, which I took west over the Des Plaines River to Rt 53.  I rode dumptruck-hell-Rt 53 north for far too long, through Romeoville, to Bolingbrook where I turned left on Lily Cache Road to Rt 19.  I rode Rt 19 north through Naperville, across the East-West Tollway (Rt 88 on maps), west on Warrenville Rd to Warrenville, then north on Winfield Rd to Central DuPage Hospital in Winfield, where I checked myself in for carbon monoxide poisoning from all the trucks. No, no, at CDH I met my Mom (she works there) and my brother Dan (he met us there), and they joined me for the last 11 or so miles along the Illinois Prairie Path rail trail through West Chicago to St. Charles, the end of this tour.  We left the hospital at around 1 pm, stopped for lunch at a great mexican restaurant in West Chicago, then chatted while riding the last miles along the rail trail to St. Chuck.          Dan's bike was in need of some repair before the ride, so we spent about a half hour or so pumping up his tires and adjusting his brakes right in front of the main entrance to the hospital - it was kinda funny.  It was a beautiful day for a ride, bright sunshine and 60 deg F, and it was great riding with them for the last miles into St. Charles.   
As a side note, I weighed the bike and trailer in St. Charles.  The fully-loaded trailer weighs 50 lbs, and the bike weighs 55 lbs.  Yikes.  I knew that I don't travel light, but I didn't know the rig weighed that much. In SLC I get to sort through the 332 photos and short movies that I took along the tour.  Aren't digital cameras great?  If you're interested (and you should be, 'cause there are some great photos, like the one of Bruce eating his potted meat food product), check back in a few weeks to look at the photos.
Important side note: I don't make empty (albeit drunken) promises.   That said, the days since that night last October crept ever closer, even as my roommate's devotion to the trip quietly faltered at nearly the same pace.  However, the looming reality (or unreality) of this trip finally asserted itself.  About two weeks ago, my roommate admitted she had neither the time or money to be gone six months, much less the physical preparation to spend all that time on a bicycle.   Fine.  Myself?  Nervous, excited, unprepared... green.  But I can not imagine NOT taking this trip... 
I've modified it (and am still modifying it): with  Nimbus Armadillo Tires - 700x28c, pedals with toe clips and straps,  Jandd expedition rear rack,  Jandd Mountain Panniers,  3 water bottle racks,  Jandd Touring Handlebar Pack II. CLOTHING:  2 pairs riding shorts (tights w/ chamois),  1 pair touring shorts w/ built in liner,  1 ss wool jersey (expensive, better be worth it),  1 pair regular shorts,  1 pair pants for dressing up,  1 collared shirt for dressing up,  4 pairs wool socks,  1 Cannondale windbreaker,  1 biking jacket,  Specialized Rockhopper bike shoes,  sandals,  2 pairs underwear (boxers and tighty-whities, so you know),  sunglasses,  cap w/ bill,  wool sweater. STUFF: compass.   oh, and sunscreen,  toiletries,  travel towel,  Eureka Zeus 2-person tent,  Moonstone sleeping bag,  jack-knifing bike tool,  needle nose pliers (thanks Galloway's Mom),  swiss army card (like the knife, but the parts come out of a blue credit card size card!) frame pump (like that sits squeezed btw seat tube and headset), helmet, journal (thanks Eva!), passport (and copies), traveler's checks (and receipts), behind-the-shirt hidden wallet, insect repellent (w/ deet), aloe vera (for sensitive skin), all purpose citronella soap (cleans hands, hair, clothing, dishes...but i haven't tried it yet), carabiner watch (thanks Whitney), first aid kit (thanks Mom!  for the diarrhea medication!)wooden clothespins (several),cell phone (that takes pictures, hopefully for this site)      Show links to this Hide links to this     
 Sunday September 14, 2003--  Training-- Thirty-five mile ride today with Dad.  From here to Southaven, MS and back. Monday September 15, 2003 -- Training--  Twenty mile solo ride.  [Central(E) to Highland, Southern(W) to Cooper, Cooper(S) to S Pkway, S Pkwy(W) to 3rd, 3rd(N) to Union, Union(W) to Front, Front(N) to Auction, Auction(N) to Harbortown, Harbortown(N) to 2nd, 2nd(S) to Chelsea, Chelsea(E) to Evergreen, Evergreen(S) to Belvedere, home] Tuesday September 16, 2003 --Training--  Twenty mile solo ride.  [Central(E) to Ellsworth, Ellsworth(S) to Southern, Southern (W) to Cooper, Cooper(N) to Peabody, Peabody(W) to Mclean, McLean(N) to N Pkwy, N Pkwy(W) to 2nd, 2nd(S) to Vance, Vance(E) to Peabody, home]   Tuesday September 16, 2003 --Journal-- : Also today... tried to figure out about crossing the border on land (after taking the Greyhound) as opposed to flying.  Flying is easier, and you're allowed to bring more.  Also, Mom is willing to donate some of her frequent flyer miles to the cause.  Probably, that's how I'll go.  Also, it starts me off already in the country and creates more potential to get farther during the actual journey. Got my tent today (Eureka Zeus 2 person).  I set it up (really easy) and sealed all the seams. Wednesday September 17, 2003 --Training--  Fifteen mile solo ride WITH LOADED PANNIERS [Central to Highland, Highland to Broad, Broad to E Pkwy, E Pkwy to Jackson, Jackson to Bellevue, Bellevue to Jefferson, Jefferson to Cleveland, Cleveland to Peabody, home].  Still not carrying a lot of stuff, including pump, tools, camera, tubes, tire, etc.  Even still... a heavy ride.  And heavy, specifically, in the back.  Getting a handlebar bag will really help even things out.  Possibly even, or instead, a front rack with maybe only a single pannier.Wednesday September 17, 2003 -- Journal -- In the absence of company, having already biked for the day, I felt impatient to buy more gear... even though I don't have the money.  I've got to wait until my drive train class with Bobby at the Peddler tomorrow.  Then I can look at exactly which tools I need.  And based on their weight and space, I'll possibly look at handlebar bags.  Instead of actual preparation for the trip (I could still be researching Mexican communities, studying Central American history, practicing bike repair), buying more gear is the temptation because it feels like getting something done.  But it's a waste of money if you don't know exactly what you need!  Speaking of... my extravagantly expensive wool jersey from Rivendell arrived today.  Just goes to show (and I am proof) that bike companies (catering primarily to the rich and frivolous) will make their products as expensive as the (poorly budgeted, but exhaustively thorough) shopper is willing to spend.   Thursday September 18, 2003 --Training--  78KM/48MI with panniers [Central to Highland, Central to Peabody, Peabody to Vance, Vance to Main, Main to Florida, Florida to ??? far south Memphis, Jewish cemetary, neighborhood near interstate, Elvis Presley Blvd, back to midtown.  THEN... later, instead of having drive train tutorial with Bobby at the Peddler, had a beer and chat, did a twenty mile ride with Hal Mabry, the owner, and his friend Phil. Talked about Memphis's heyday as a tv town with on-air personalities like Wink Martindale, George Klein, Dewey Phillips plus costumed, southern accented scary movie hosts on weekend nights.  Did all towns once have their own tv culture...?]Thursday September 18, 2003 --Journal--  Bought plane ticket today!  October 6, I leave on Northwest for Houston, then subsequently Continental for Monterrey.  Before then, I've got to figure out how to put together and take apart a bike, and how to fix basic drive train and wheel problems that might arise.  Tonight, man oh man did Hal and Phil give me a workout.  I don't know if they were just testing me, since I had panniers on as well, and we hadn't ever ridden before.  Testing my mettle...  stamina...  Not so difficult, when you get tired is when you aren't being efficient anymore with your movement.  At least, before you're totally whipped, you can fire back up just by finding your efficiency again.  But it was dark... and I hit some bumps.  A good test for my new tires.. but not the kind of riding I hope to do too much of.  At least not without a full size headlight on the front of my bike.  Or maybe a friend just to follow me on nighttime rides in an SUV as an escort...?  Also checked out a couple of books from the library about Central America.  But, man, it's really happening now.  It's hard to focus much on reading books now... It's almost time to go!  Tomorrow, I'll buy tools maybe... Or I could wait until the actual tutorial on Monday.  Before then, ride, ride, ride! Friday September 19, 2003--Training--30KM/18MI SOLO, with panniers(w.p.) [Peabody(W) to Vance, Vance(W) to Main, Main(S) to S Pkwy (indirectly), S Pkwy(E) to Willett, Willett(N) to Madison, Madison(E) to Avalon, Avalon(N) to N Pkwy, N Pkwy(W) to Second St, Second(S) to Vance, Vance(E) to Peabody, home]Friday September 19, 2003 --Journal--An amazing ride just as the sun was going down.  Spent the entire day, from the moment I woke up until I got ready to ride at six pm, reading "The Da Vinci Code," a fascinating book... transfixed me the entire day.  Then I suppose that made me more thoughtful as I was out riding.  As I rode downtown and headed back the first time, I was aware for the first time of fall weather-- and felt reminded of college in Chicago.  At the same time though, something in the sky and the early evening reminded me of Peru.  And something about Memphis, specifically the South Memphis I was riding through, is down and out--the boarded up buildings, the burned out houses, the decaying porches-- yet at the same time invigorating-- kids riding bikes, people cooking out on their stoop, an empty but well kept park with green grass as the sun goes down, the smell of much cotton candy being spun at the Mid-South Fair not too far away... but far enough that it must be a lot of cotton candy if you can smell it from here...  and it's Friday night!  People come out on the weekends here like they don't really do on weekdays.  Of course, the biker, racing by it all, you feel removed.  But uplifted nonetheless.  And I felt even more tantalized, almost disbelieving of the awesome trip I'm about to take.  !! Saturday September 20, 2003 (NO CYCLING TODAY)--Journal-- While I didn't ride today, I prepared for my imminent Mexico trip in a different way... I acted as translator for the minister at a wedding for a Mexican couple.  Thanks Ephren!  Ephren (who has family in Monterrey) helped me translate the vows several days ago over beers at Bosco's.  Over beers...mmm... Monday September 22, 2003 (LITTLE CYCLING TODAY)--Journal--Some boring things today that didn't really fill the entire day... (These days before I leave, not working, offer almost too much time) but things that had to be done.  Ordered new copies of credit cards.  Don't get stuck in a foreign country with a scratched, stripped credit card as your only form of payment (from experience)!  Purchased a cell phone and calling plan (may come in handy... but hopefully not due to emergency)  Significantly, I did a drive train session with supreme bike dude Bobby at the Peddler bike shop tonight.  With instruction, I took apart the entire drive train - removing the chain, chain rings, cassette, crank arms, even bottom bracket - and cleaned everything.  Then put everything back, relubing the chain, putting locktite on threads and noting the direction of the threads on all bolts.  We went over basic maintenance that can be done on the road to avoid having to take everything apart very often (since a drive train overhaul cannot be done on the road).   Tuesday September 23, 2003 --Training-- 78KM/48MI SOLO RIDE w.p.Good long ride on Mississippi River Trail.  A good trail b/c traffic is mostly very low, and you get to cycle on some surprisingly country roads for so close to such an urban area.  Actually, you're still in Memphis on much of the trail, which is even more surprising.  At least, I was surprised.  But I'm kind of a Memphis nerd.Tuesday September 23, 2003 --Journal-- Also, ordered handlebar bag, straps and glow strips off internet today.  The bag should balance the weight of the back a little and give me room for whatever else I'll still need to pack.  Oh, and I decided yesterday to tape up the bike frame with electrical tape so it won't be so obviously the space age wonder that it is.  Then this morning I thought it'd be cool to put a few bumperstickers over the tape.  Maybe some representatively Memphis stickers. Thursday September 25, 2003 --Training-- 30KM/18MI SOLORode my bike without a lot of gear and the speed was exhilarating.  Also, for the first time (and this sounds really cheesy ((and probably should since I was stoned)) I was biking back from someone's house last night and really felt like the bike was an extension of my legs.  Like I was running down the street at 20mph.  I think biking probably does have to be the most productive use of the human body's potential for movement (to quote an educational bike video).  Did a training session last night at the Peddler, truing wheels, replacing spokes... not so much fun.  But vital to understand.  Then the tube under the front tire I put back on the rim blew out.  Oops.  That'll never happen again. .... Saturday September 27, 2003 --Journal--Loaded panniers today as close to actual weight as I could.  Rode downtown and back just for a sample ride... pretty heavy in the back.  But probably not so bad I'll have to put them on a rack in the front.  Realized today that, based on my average of 25 miles/day at 5 days/week, it will take me almost four months just to get the 2000 miles I've estimated from Monterrey to Merida(thanks Henry).  So who knows if I get that far, what I'll do... maybe fly to South America, keep on biking to Panama City and then fly home...?  But these are petty in the moment decisions, to be decided when I get there. Tuesday September 30, 2003 --Training-- 35MI SOLOCentral(E) to Goodlett, Goodlett(N) to Tuckahoe, Tuckahoe (E) to Shady Grove, Shady Grove (E) to Humphreys (Wolf River Pkwy), Wolf River Pkwy(E) to Germantown Rd.  Found great park alongside Wolf River on way back.  Tuesday September 30, 2003 --Journal--Spent an incredible morning out on the road.  Made the excellent discovery of the Wolf River Trails.  Information about people who once lived along and on the river, info about the Tennessee Valley Authority (which, did you know is the country's largest distributor of electricity).  Also traded my non-functioning trip cell phone today for a picture-taking phone.  Now, I can post every photographic detail of my trip online (did you know this can be done?!)  So be looking for grainy, off center shots to accompany my ramblings.  Just five days until the trip...  Nothing to do now but, go!  Thursday October 2, 2003 --Journal--Boxed the bike today at the Peddler (thanks to Bobby and a free box and packing materials).  I do hope I'll remember how to put the bike back together in Mexico.   Sunday October 5, 2003 --Journal--I leave... tomorrow!  After a year of planning -- and the leisurely month I've spent at home since I quit working -- I leave at 6:50AM tomorrow morning for Monterrey.  People ask me if I'm nervous, and I don't know what to say.  It's not that I am or I'm not.  It's that I've stopped looking at the trip in the "macro" -- the furthest I'm thinking right now is getting my bike put back together tomorrow in a hotel room in Monterrey.  I need to get there (to Monterrey), then find a cab that will fit the bike box, then find a hotel, then assemble the bike... then whatever comes next.  Including how exactly I'll get to my first destination.
 
 
The past two days in Monterrey were cool.  I began by putting my bike back together when I got in on Monday.  My hotel, though very nice and very expensive, was in a "dangerous" part of town.  Lots of "homosexuales," my taxi driver explained.  I didn't have any confrontations, however.   My two favorite moments in Monterrey were both last night.  I was wandering around downtown and the Barrio Antiguo last night when I heard amplified classical piano music echoing loudly across the plaza.  And this is a sprawling, green, statue-covered plaza that covers many city blocks.  I followed the sound to the Palacio del Gobierno del Estado de Nuevo Leon.  The Palace was beautiful, brilliantly lit, and the music, it turns out, was being played over a sound system from inside.  There was a small room with a man inside, whose sole job I guess was to choose the music.  I sat outside for a while on the steps, listening, checking out the Monterrey skyline, checking out the many, many couples PDA-ing on benches all around the plaza.  If only there were such a place in Memphis.  If only couples in the United States did that.  If only I had a girlfriend!    The second awesome moment came just as I was ready to turn in for the night at my new hotel after walking all over downtown.  I was staying in the Barrio Antiguo.  Just as I approached the corner of my hotel I heard live music - latin music this time.  Drums, like several drummers, trumpet, keyboard, guitar, etc.  There was no sign over the door, but just then people walked past me and right inside.  I followed them in.  Inside was a packed club with only men inside.  The band was playing at floor level in the corner of the room.  And they were rocking out!  It was refreshing to wander into what sort of felt like a Mexican Wild Bill's (Memphis blues bar) after wandering past countless trendy, more commercial bars in the area.  It turns out that this club only has music one night a month, and that it is a member's only club.  I never figured out if I was really allowed to be there or not, but the patrons were very friendly.  The Argentinian band jammed out, and a couple of people who had brought instruments joined the band for a song.  Mostly young, the group had come to Monterrey out of the dire economics of Argentina.  They gave me their cd, so if I can hold onto it the whole trip, maybe I can listen to it when I get home.  Maybe book them at next year's festival, Judy? Tomorrow, hopefully, towards Zacatecas.  Two hundred thirty five miles across high desert plains.  If I push it, over two days, get there by the weekend.  Again, I question my choice of route... PS. My camera won't transmit pictures over email from Mexico.  So much for that idea.  Also, I did cover my bicycle with black electrical tape and stickers a couple of nights ago.  So at least now it sticks out like a sore thumb.  Or wait, is that a good thing?   
I woke up yesterday feeling guilty about taking another night for free in a lavish hotel.  Also, I didn't really feel like I knew what to do with myself.  I'm still a little too intimidated to do much walking around by myself.  I ate at McDonald's next to the hotel twice while I was in Saltillo - for dinner and breakfast.  Now that's embarrassing.  But it was so good. So, today I chill out and let my legs rest over a few Corona's.  This is a very pleasant small mountain town.  And it's bright and hot, and there's guitar music playing over the plaza in front of the iglesia.  And tonight, Amorres Perros is on television!  You're thinking, he's watching a lot of television...  But I might have to camp tomorrow, so I'll take it as it comes.  Then again, I may take the bus tomorrow, depending on how I feel.   Zacatecas is the next big town that I really want to see.  I'll probably spend a few days there.  I should get there tomorrow (if I give up and take the bus) or the next day.  After that, I should be entering a much more inhabited area.  I'll get to visit a lot of small towns up in the Central Highlands: Guanajuato, San Miguel Allende, San Luis Potosi... perhaps meeting a few tourists along the way?  I certainly wouldn't mind the contact.  At all.
Zacatecas is beautiful.  Very much like Cusco in Peru.  I'm sure I'll have more to say of it in the next few days, since I plan to stay here a while.           
I left Zacatecas and headed for Aguascalientes, an unexciting destination, according to what I'd read.  Anyways, I get very far, like fifty five miles, within about three hours.  On the left side of the highway I see this sort of exotic looking cabana with an adjacent beautifully kept garden.  A sign like would be on a restaurant or hotel advertises "Villa Santana."  I did the indecisive thing and drove by it and back and by it again a couple of times.  I finally decided it looked too friendly and potentially ripe for camping to pass it up, so I walked up the driveway.  After much dog barking, three guys came out from behind the house.  I explained my situation and that I thought maybe I could camp and they invited me in.  We sat behind the house for a couple of hours, drinking tequila with fresca.  The namesake of the bar was Sergio Santana, incidentally a first cousin of Carlos Santana, of "Black Magic Woman" fame.  There were three other guys.  One of them was Salome, a ranchero who tended to Sergio's property.  The other two were Felix and Eloy, who co-operate a "massage" business, providing "massages" by "chicas de Sonora, Chihuahua and Guadalajara" for seven hundred pesos an hour.  They were trying to arrange a party for eighty men (and paid professionals) in Sergio's palapa in the upcoming weekend.  I just so happened to get to sit at the table and listen to their conversation at length over cheap tequila.  Finally, we dropped off Sergio at his place, and I ditched the camping idea in favor of staying at Eloy's place for free in Aguascalientes.  There begins a very bizarre detour in my bicycle adventure.  I spent the night, uneventfully.  The next day we set out - Eloy, his girlfriend Carmen and Salome - for some sightseeing.  We took in a tour guide's explanation of some fairly impressive murals in a gov't building.  We took in the major church.  Eloy bought me a rosary.  We dined tapas-style over several beers and snapped a couple of pictures.  Like variations on the theme "fried," with a few beers.  Very nice.  At home, the streak continues with dinner and more drinking, tequila of course.  Eventually, I pass out on the couch.   The next morning, Eloy walks in the living room with two severe black eyes.  The story goes, after I fell asleep, Eloy thought Carmen was drinking too much, so he said so.  Salome, who apparently had definitely been drinking too much, defended Carmen.  He and Eloy got into a fight.  Carmen fled the apartment before Salome battered Eloy severely before leaving himself.   When I woke up, Carmen and Salome were gone, and I was very confused.  How had I slept through the whole thing, and how had what was good gone so bad?  Felix explained that you never let a ranchero drink too much.  Sort of like pouring water on a gremlin, or so I related.  I spent the day with Felix and Eloy.  We went to pick up cash after a "massage."  We had lunch in some empty political campaign offices where we met some girls, who were looking for employment.  We took them to be shown to the manager of a restaurant.  We took one of them to a house and waited the allotted hour for her to complete her work.   All in all, it was a safe, but very bizarre, very out-of-a-movie detour.  I left the next morning while Eloy was asleep.   
  

Downtown, and all throughout and underneath the town, run a series of tunnels.  Occasionally, the tunnels open up from above and you can see houses hanging on the edge and trees growing on the walls.  Guanajuato has a law forbidding any new building be built within city limits, so imagine a perfectly preserved colonial hillside mining town with its defining architecture dating from the early 1800's and earlier.  If you can take all that in...   Last night after settling in, I watched Casablanca (in English) on a screen outdoors at the foot of the steep steps to the university.  Then beers with a few girls I met as the crowd was dispersing.  Until the end of the month Guanajuato celebrates the Cervantino festival, a major Mexican and international tourist event with theatre, dance and music performances from all over the world.  I should be here about a week, so I'll probably take in some of the performances, many of which are free.  Also, take in a few more beers, relax and meet some more folks.  More to come... Here's a link about the Cervantino festival: http://www.festivalcervantino.gob.mx       
The way it goes is they actually surrounded me while I was sitting on a bench and started chatting me up.  One of them took my glasses and asked for ten pesos.  I didn't have it - at least I didn't think he'd make me change - and I was so surprised/angry/humiliated I just told them to go away.  But next time I'll just beat somebody up.  This just happened about an hour ago... A couple of links:  http://digestive.niddk.nih.gov/ddiseases/pubs/diarrhea/index.htm http://cdl.library.cornell.edu/moa/browse.author/m.122.html

While confused about how to get to Tzintzunzan, we met Vicky, with whom we shared a cab.  When we arrived to this small village, the "party" had definitely already started.  American rock music playing out the open windows of pickup trucks as young locals tailgated alongside the highway.  The irrelevant, drunken SuperBowl side to an otherwise traditional celebration was definitely in effect.   There was a lit dance stage and risers.  We sat and watched the dance of the Viejitos (Little Old Men), accompanied by live, poorly amplified Purepecha music (the Purepechas are the indigenous people in Michoacan, this state).  The men were dressed all in white, wore smiling pink masks, carried wooden canes and topped it all with sombreros that dangled colored streamers.  To the festive sounds of the native Purepecha music, they circled and tapped and doffed their hats around the stage.  We sat and watched until the risers made a cracking sound and everyone got off.   We first saw the lights in the cemetery from high above, from the grounds of the ruins the town is best known for.  When we reached the bottom, the cemetery grounds were crowded.  It was like Christmas Eve meets Fourth of July meets major sporting event.  Even more families jammed around single plots.  Children roaming the grounds looking to clean or re-paint sepulchres for money.  Adult vendors hawking pink cotton candy from six foot poles leaned on their shoulder.  Tourists with cameras on tripods.  Candles amidst flowers amidst framed photographs amidst bananas and apples and chocolate and sugared skeleton candies.  As I stumbled down a muddy section in the dark, a female voice called out "Armando!" definitely in my direction.  It was Vicky from the taxi.  I spent the next four hours of wet candlelit cold with Vicky and her daughters, huddled around Vicky's husband's grave, stoking the fire they'd made, enjoying hot fruit punch.  I got to participate!  I wasn't just a meandering photo-tourist politely asking to reap the multitudinous coffee table book photo-ops (and a fantastic Dia de Muertos coffee table book could have been produced).  But that's in a way exactly why I didn't bring a real camera, why I had a simple disposable jammed in the single pocket of my Camelbak.  Around four am, I accepted the offer I'd initially refused to spend the rest of the night in Vicky's house.  I thought I wanted to watch the sun come up, but I found my stamina lacking.  The next morning, Vicky woke me up and paid my taxi to Quiroga, from which I took a bus back to Morelia.  And this was an awesome Day of the Dead.
The volcano was incredible.  As if it could have been any other way.  It is the youngest, or one of the youngest, volcanoes in the world - and the only volcano for humans to have witnessed being created (in 1943).  It destroyed two villages, Paricutin and San Juan.  The volcano took the village directly beneath its name.  San Juan was entirely destroyed, but for the church that was partially covered by lava.  It's a striking site to come upon.  Then, we got to run down the side of it.  Sort of feels like running on the moon if you jump while coming down, because your feet come down "weightlessly" into soft volcanic ash.  You really had to be there... Due in part to the open sore the horseback riding left on my behind, but mainly to the incredible vistas, this was an unforgettable experience.
I didn't know then when or if I'd be back, or whether I'd still be a crazy guy on a bike.  And, as it turns out, I will be merely a fairly average guy on a bus.  Sigh...  Too many variables.  Solo bike touring is very hard (or so I felt).  Though I do think I was almost over the hump.  After crying on the side of the road in Guanajuato because one of my bags fell off - and I was going to miss the early bus to Morelia from Guanajuato! - something clicked.  Some realization of the right - and THE WRONG - ways to experience a bicycle tour.  Then the next day I had a seizure.  Add to this crazy, open-ended, educational biking adventure the possibility of another seizure, and you've got even me convinced.  I'll shelve the biking adventure, for a while.   Thanks for following my trip!  Going out of the country on a bicycle - and letting everyone know about it - is a great excuse to get in touch with EVERYONE you know.  Though it does make the moment of giving up that trip only a month in a little more embarrassing.  My de-bicycled trip starts next Wednesday in Mexico City.  Again, I'll stay until the rest of the money or the travelin' spirit is gone - or until the next seizure.  If I find another journal website, I may continue my travel log.  If so, I'll be certain to let all you vicarious travel groupies know the address.  Thanks again for all the attention!    -Drew (you should still email me often at click to show email)
In Fall/Winter 2002/2003 as I was contemplating my next touring adventure, Alaska came to mind. I wanted to do a self-contained tour in a beautifully exotic place. We'd visited Alaska in late Spring 2000. I had a 'feel' for the terrain and the road conditions from that trip. Also, the 2000 visit had whetted my appetite to see more of this huge and wild state. I would not have had the nerve to do this trip had I not been to Alaska previously. To avoid the worst of the Alaska bug problem, I scheduled the trip for late May-early June. I would have liked to have toured for longer than two weeks but my employer frowns on anything longer than that. I anticipated temperatures for this time of year to be anywhere between 20 and 80 F. It wasn't far off this mark. I decided to start my ride in Valdez and to take the Richardson Highway to Fairbanks. From Fairbanks, I had the option of catching the Alaska Railroad back to Anchorage if pressed for time. This indeed happened and I took the train from Fairbanks to Denali National Park where I camped two nights. I concluded the trip by taking the train from Denali N. P. back to Anchorage. Getting to Valdez involved a day of travel on the Alaska Railroad (Anchorage to Whittier) and on the Alaska Marine Highway (Whittier to Valdez).    I flew from Greensboro, NC to Anchorage with plane changes in Chicago and Denver. I was fearful of the airlines misplacing my baggage with three flight segments so I shipped everything by UPS to the Anchorage Hampton Inn. 'Everything' consisted of three boxes: bike, BOB trailer, and BOB trailer bag. While touring, I kept family and friends up to date by email using a Pocketmail device. The daily accounts in this travel journal were the daily email postings I had sent during the tour with minor editing. 
Judy Colwell's trip with Adventure Cycling Association in 1995 was a good primer on Alaska touring. Ed Noonan reports on a 1996 trip from Alaska to Florida. Janet North offers an excellent overview of what Alaska touring is like. Susan Walker and her daughter Jessica celebrate their 60 th and 30 th birthdays while touring the 49 th state. Books that I had read or consulted included: The Milepost Alaska, James A. Michener  Lonely Planet Alaska, Jim Dufresne (I carried this with me)  Delorme's Alaska Atlas and Gazetteer (I cut out the maps I needed for the trip)  Coming into the Country, John McPhee  Against the Wind, Marty Basch What else did I do? I cycled up and down the mountains around home as much as time allowed.
I arrived around 8:30 pm to warm (relatively) sunny skies. My bicycle and gear were at the Hampton Inn waiting for me. I had shipped it up UPS for fear of something getting lost if I had checked it as baggage (three flights to get here with changes in Chicago and Denver). I assembled my bike this evening in my motel room. Tomorrow morning I'll reassemble my BOB trailer and repack for hitting the road. Tomorrow is another travel day (well, mostly a non-bicycle travel day) as I take the train and ferry to Valdez. I'll cycle to the train depot, about 3 miles from the motel. Weather's looking nice. Regards,  Roger in Anchorage
There wasn't much cycling today as it was a day in transit. I left the Hampton Inn at around 8 am and biked to the train station in about half an hour. Got my bike and trailer loaded  onto the train with the help of a baggage handler and the conductor. The conductor said, "Don't tell them inside you have a bike or they'll charge you extra." I confessed that I'd already paid the extra fee but thanked him for his help and advice. The weather was overcast, but visibility was good. At one point, ram Dall sheep were fairly close to the RR track so the train stopped so everyone could have a look. Where else but Alaska! Got to Whittier a little after noon and offloaded my gear. The ferry terminal was just across the way from the train drop point (no depot in Whittier). Headed there and checked in, locked up my bike, and had lunch at the Swiftwater Cafe (Halibut, cole slaw, and a few beers). The weather in Whittier was getting real nice--I believe it must have been the nicest day ever in this town that gets 176 inches of rain and 22 feet of snow every year. The word "weird" comes to mind with Whittier. It was built during WWII to serve as an ice-free port for Anchorage. But it's cut off from Anchorage by mountains and glaciers. Until recently, the only access was by rail through a tunnel or by ship via Prince William Sound (now motor vehicles alternate through the tunnel with the trains). Now it's home to a few hundred residents, most of whom live in the same WWII vintage apartment building. Whittier nestles at the foot of a glacier which spills cold air down on the town winter and summer. Someone said, "If God wanted to give the earth an enema, Whittier is where He'd insert the hose." What with earthquakes and all, I think I'd live somewhere else. However, this day was beautiful in Whittier.     The ferry ride started out great but soon overcast skies and rain in the Prince William Sound chased all but the hardiest inside. Saw some Steller's sea lion colonies. The ferry--the M/V Bartlett--took a route close to Columbia glacier and a sea strewn with hull thumping ice burgs. Kept looking around for Leonardo Di Caprio. I arrived in Valdez around 9:30, rode to the Eagle's Rest campground and set up camp in a light drizzle--not too cold, high 50's. Went to sleep following a nip of brandy. Roger in Valdez 
I woke up early in Valdez; thank goodness for the Totem Inn restaurant that opens at 5 am. I ordered a short stack special which was two pancakes and two eggs (over easy). The waitress served my order; I didn't say anything but the eggs were a little too firm. As I was preparing to devour this assembly, the waitress came back with two more eggs: "The cook thought those other eggs were too firm," she said. Well, I knew it was going to be a long climb up to Thompson Pass so eagerly I dug into my expanded breakfast. Valdez is at the head of a long fiord. The town is surrounded by snow capped peaks and is very attractive. The morning was partly cloudy and offered hopes of a nice day. I broke camp and headed out at 8. The Richardson Highway begins in Valdez and I would be following this same highway all the way to Fairbanks (it's hard to get lost in Alaska if you're on a paved road). A bike path paralleled the highway for the first several miles out of town. At first, the road was level and pleasant.  About 10 or 15 miles out of Valdez, the road runs through Keystone Canyon, a real dramatic section with high rock walls and misty waterfalls. I stopped in the canyon to adjust my trailer load. I had strapped both the bear resistant food canister and the tent on top of the trailer bag, parallel with the length of the trailer. The load was not balancing correctly so I re-secured the food container laterally across the trailer and held it in place with some creative strapping and bungee cording. This arrangement felt better and was the loading method I'd use for the rest of the trip. On the ferry yesterday, I'd met a couple from Anchorage who expressed interest in my plans and route. "Have you ever been to Valdez?" he asked. "No," I replied. "Ah . . . , there's a long hill after you leave town," he cautioned. Thompson Pass--I'd read about it. Gradually the climb began, gently at first, then in earnest. And it climbed, and climbed, and climbed. It took hours to get near the top and then I had a flat tire. On the good side, the weather was splendid and the scenery awesome. I finally peaked over Thompson Pass, a little shy of 3000 feet (this place is the snowiest in Alaska and there was still a considerable amount along the roadside).      Then, DOWNHILL! I had about 30 miles yet to go to my intended campground, and it wasn't all downhill, unfortunately. And it rained off and on. I used the last of my water so stopped to filter some from a stream; from now on I'll be drinking glacial runoff and snow melt. Got to the campground only to find it closed and posted, "No Overnight Camping." At this point I was really tired. So, I went a few more miles and stealth camped in the woods. Set up camp in a light rain and was too tired to fix dinner so, with my bear spray handy, I crashed to bed at 7. Roger, somewhere in Alaska. 
Slept well in my stealth campsite in spite of a visit from my old nemesis: leg cramps. Woke up thinking a grizzly bear was gnawing on my thigh. And here's a problem: How do you deal with a cramped up leg in a cramped up tent? With a rash of intense massage, stretching, and cursing, I relieved the cramping and returned to blissful sleep. Woke up early (I'd fallen asleep around 7), had a peanut butter burrito, broke camp, and was on the road by 6. This day was spectacular. The weather was not only nice, it boosted my peddling with a tail wind all day long (thus my average speed was so high). I stopped at the Copper Center Roadhouse for a late breakfast. They feature pancakes made from a 100-year old sourdough starter; which of course I had.    I stopped at the Dry Creek Campground about 4 miles from Glennallen. Arrived around noon, set up camp, and rode into Glennallen to do a laundry. I wanted to wash everything and was hoping there was a restroom in the laundry mat so I could change into my rain gear and wash the clothes I was wearing. No restroom. I stripped off as much as modesty permitted and pranced around in cycling shorts and rain jacket while the washer and dryer did their thing. Must have been a big thrill for the laundry ladies of Glennallen. Back at the campground I cooked dinner over my handy-dandy wood-burning Sierra Zip stove; fuel this evening was twigs and pine cones. This has been a very pleasant day of cycling. Turned in early. Regards, Roger near Glennallen. 
Left the campground near Glennallen at about 7:30 this morning. Another nice day for cycling: nice weather and a tail wind, although not as strong as yesterday's.    Today I was planning to ride to Paxson and stay at a lodge there (three days, no shower--you understand). About twenty miles short of Paxson, I stopped at the Meiers Lake Roadhouse for a late lunch. Also late lunching there were two ladies from Washington, DC. They were staying at a lodge in Paxson and reported the only place to eat there was the Paxson Inn and then advised not to. In fact, they'd driven the twenty miles to Meiers Lake to avoid eating in Paxson. On the spot, I booked at room at the Meiers Lake Roadhouse. Nice place, a mixture of old classic Alaska with modern conveniences. Room is new and clean. The shower sure felt good. I washed out those few items of clothing that modesty prevented me from washing yesterday. Today was a lesson in local variations in climate. I was riding through terrain equal in elevation to the Thompson Pass and nearly 200 miles further north. But unlike the Pass, today's terrain was below the tree line and there was no snow in the vicinity. Amazing difference. A few weeks prior to taking this trip, I was having breakfast with my two work companions, Mitch and Steve, in a Perkins Restaurant in Orlando. Spying the tray of jellies and jams, I pocketed several thinking they'd be handy on this trip. Mitch, observing this action, attempted to turn me in to the Perkins Jelly and Jam Security Guard but I managed to escape the restaurant before getting handcuffed. I am using a hard plastic, bear proof container to store my food items. Before leaving for Alaska, this container was packed very full of stuff. Well, when I opened my stash up here, everything was sticky. Investigation proved the culprit to be a leaking packet of Perkins orange marmalade. The result has been that everything I've eaten from my food stash has had a certain flair: gorp a l'orange, peanut butter burrito a l'orange, cous cous a l'orange. . .well, you get the picture. I hope to get everything wiped off and destickified this evening at the Roadhouse. There must be a valuable lesson here. With a sunburned face, Roger at the Meiers Lake Roadhouse 
Had a nice stack of pancakes for breakfast at the Meiers Lake Roadhouse. Rule 1 when road tripping in Alaska: never pass up a stack of pancakes. As I was assembling my kit, I found a flat tire on the bike. There was a fine steel wire in the tire that probably caused the problem but I couldn't find the leak in the tube (must be a slow leak) so I just put on a new tube. Left around 7:30.    About 3-4 mile north of the Roadhouse, three grizzly bears (mother and cubs, no doubt) started to cross the road about 50 yards ahead of me. Not wanting to discuss who had the right of way, I braked to a stop. The cubs crossed and headed into the brush; momma bear paused, turned, and looked straight at me. I THINK I heard her say, "Hey kids, here's our meal on wheels." Not wanting to become bear breakfast, I waved my arms which in bearspeak means something akin to: "I am an unthreatening and thoroughly tasteless human." Satisfied with that, momma followed her two cubs into the brush to saunter on--or set an ambush. Well, no ambush and I survive, remaining potential bear meal rather than the less desirable alternative. Today I rode through the Alaska Range. Isabel Pass was considerably easier than Thompson Pass. The climb was shorter and a gentler grade--didn't even have to use my lowest gear.    But, it became payback time for those tailwind days. Once up to Isabel Pass, it was strong headwinds. Isabel Pass is near the headwaters of the Delta River: this valley forms a funnel for wind and it was all directed at me. How windy was it, you ask? It was so windy, I had to peddle downhill. It was so windy, I couldn't whistle. It was so windy, I had to blow my nose down wind. Etc. It was a nice ride in spite of it with great weather and more magnificent scenery. There was something unexpected I observed while peddling beside the Delta River. I had to climb hills in order to cross streams feeding into the Delta. These side streams have carried huge amounts of glacial debris down from the ice fields and have built alluvial fans like those I've seen in Death Valley. So, the streams are running down on top of this mass of till and the road has to climb up to cross them. Riding away from these streams was fast and fun but climbing up to them was, ah, glacial. ("Oh, how could he have stooped so low?") This evening I am at the Donnelly Creek Campground, it's virtually empty. There's been a chattering red squirrel to keep me company. Also two large birds (larger than bluejays, smaller than crows) keep hanging around. I understand they prefer peanuts to almonds. This area is supposed to be within the grazing range of the Alaskan bison herd but I have yet to see any. I'm now about 130 miles from Fairbanks. I could do this in two days but I think I'll extend it to three and drop my pace a bit. After sixty or seventy miles pulling my load, all I want to do is eat and sleep. There are some towns up ahead and a slower pace will allow some time to explore. We'll see how it goes. I'm ready to trade in my front wheel for a pizza. Getting stronger every day, Roger along the Delta River. 
Set out from Donnelly Creek Campground arond 7:30. There was some hill climbing until I passed a geologic feature called Donnelly's Dome. After that, it was downhill or dead flat. All in all, a leisurely day.    I stopped in Delta Junction for lunch and a few grocery items. My final destination was only another six miles to Big Delta (actually much smaller than Delta Junction). I'm semi-stealth camping at the Big Delta Historical Park. The only "camping" here is a parking lot for the motorhomers to overnight in. I've just set up my tent near some picnic tables at the edge of the woods on the banks of the Tanana River.      This park is set up around Rika's Roadhouse (now a museum of sorts rather than a functioning roadhouse). Historically, this spot is significant for being at a transportation/communications hub in the old days. It's at the confluence of two major rivers (Delta and Tanana) and it's where the Richardson Highway (which I have been on since I started this ride) and the Alaska Highway (formerly Alcan Hwy) cross the Tanana River. Formerly, a ferry operated at this spot. The park caters to the tourist crowd as there have been several bus loads of people in and out since I've been here. There are some fowl at the park including a peacock whose yelping calls I hear from time to time. Camping, I have observed, has a rhythm about it, much like breathing. In the morning, it resembles an inhale as all my gear gets placed into organizational bags (like alveoli) which then get placed into the larger packing bags. All of that is secured to trailer or bike and the breath is held for the day. Then in the evening, everything is exhaled out of the bags and scattered about for the temporary convenience of this camper. This park has a restaurant where I ate dinner (a very interesting reindeer sausage sandwich). Unfortunately, they don't open until 9 in the morning so I'll likely be gone before I can sample their pancakes. I purchased one of their specialty pastries called a bear claw to eat in the morning. Relaxing with the peacock, Roger at Rika's Roadhouse 
First, let me advocate that should you ever find yourself near Rika's Roadhouse, do not skip the bear claw pastry. A great breakfast treat. Well, this day was so splendid for cycling, I rode to North Pole. This little community capitalizes on its name by offering all sorts of Christmas theme things all year round. This afternoon here, the temperature at the local bank was 78 degrees yet there was Santa Claus hanging on to the proverbial barber-striped north pole offering boundless Christmas goodies. Apparently, North Pole, Alaska survives on its name (and a lot of consumers from nearby Eielson Air Force Base).  Today's ride was a cyclist's dream. There were some hills this morning but all afternoon was flat as an Alaskan sourdough pancake with frequent views of the Tanana River and the Alaska Range beyond. For the first since being here, I rode in tee shirt and shorts.    When I arrived in North Pole, I checked into the Beaver Lake Resort Motel for the night. My room has a FULL kitchen and a wonderful shower (well OK, any shower at this point would rate as wonderful). Also, there is a laundry facility on premises and a restaurant that serves pizza within walking distance. Truly a touring cyclist's dream come true. I've sorted out my schedule for the next few days. Tomorrow I will cycle through Fairbanks to Ester (about 7 miles the other side) to camp there in order to go to the show at the Malamute Saloon tomorrow evening. Then on Sunday, I'll tool around Fairbanks checking things out. Monday, I've booked train passage to Denali National Park. What happens there will depend on availability of campground sites, etc.  According to my trusty GPS, sunrise where I now am is a little before 4 am with sunset around 11:30; I'll have to trust the GPS because so far I have been awake for neither. Of course, it never gets dark. I packed a flashlight but so far it's been only ballast. The other evening I awoke around 12:30 and began thinking about the next day's stop and campsites. I reached for Lonely Planet's Alaska guide, which I am carrying, and had no trouble reading, without flashlight, in the tent. Warm in sunny Alaska, Roger at North Pole 
I left that little bit of paradise at the Beaver Lake Resort Motel at about 8 am after breakfasting on my leftover pizza from last night. It was a 15 mile ride to Fairbanks where my first stop was the visitors center. I picked up a bikeways map so I could traverse the city with minimal problems with automobile traffic. My next stop was the bike shop to pick up a patch kit and an inner tube. My gear stirred up much interest at the shop from customers and shop people alike. I was headed west to Ester to camp at the Ester Gold Camp and took a somewhat circuitous route in order to stop at the large animal research station. There was a tour scheduled for later in the day so I proceeded to Ester (about 5 miles further) and set up camp. That accomplished, I returned to the research center and got to see musk oxen, caribou and reindeer up close. Musk oxen are some of the most awkward looking animals I have seen but they are amazing to watch--they play, butt each other and cavort around, apparently, just to have fun. They are an animal that looks like it enjoys life.    Returning to Ester, I took a nap (aah) and then a shower (aaahh). Ester Gold Camp is a funky little tourist trap that went from being a gold mine to becoming a gold mine. The roads are dirt and dusty, all the buildings are authentically original--it's very unpretentious yet offers some neat things to do and see. There's a hotel/restaurant and nearby bunk houses and shower houses that date back to the '30's. For entertainment there is the "photosymphony" which is a panoramic slide show of the aurora borealis set to symphonic music. And of course the "world famous" Malemute Saloon with it's presentation of humorous skits, music, and reading of Robert Service poetry.  One little musical ditty was about a drunken Scotsman who fell asleep beside the road. Two curious and mischievous ladies spot him and wonder what Scotsmen wear under their kilts. They peek and having satisfied their curiosity, one of the ladies pulls a blue ribbon from her hair to leave with the Scot. Presently, the Scotsman awakes and needs to relieve himself. Off he goes behind a tree and lifts up his kilt. Noting the unexpected accouterment, the Scot exclaims, "I don't know where ya bin, laddy, but ya won first prize." A good time was had by all. Roger at the Ester Gold Camp 
Count today as a rest day. It rained last night at the Ester Gold Camp and continued to rain into the morning. I just relaxed in the dry, warmth of my tent until the rain let up. Then I went over to the camp office for a breakfast of coffee and muffin (this was included with the camp site!) and gradually assembled my gear. Headed out of Ester back to Fairbanks at about 9.    I checked in at my campsite in Fairbanks (Rivers Edge Campground) about an hour later. This is a full service campground accommodating RV's, tents and  offering cabins. It has a classy restaurant, gift shop, showers, laundry, etc. My tent site is right on the Chena River and very pleasant, if not completely private (I'm no longer in the wilderness but in a city). It's significantly cooler today--low 50's. It must have been a cold front that moved through here last night. No shorts and tee today! As I was setting up camp, a man and his two young daughters came over to chat. They'd driven up from Texas, seen cyclists on the road and wanted to know how it was possible to travel that way. So, I got to do what every touring cyclist loves to do: talk about bicycle touring!  After setting up camp, I rode to the museum at the University of Alaska Fairbanks. Though small, the exhibits were well done and informative. Real interesting gold display. After that, I traversed Fairbanks's bike paths exploring the town a bit. Then I headed back to the campground for the always satisfying shower. Read a bit before heading to Chena's, the campground's restaurant for a dinner of grilled salmon. I met a couple of touring cyclists at the campground this evening. They 're German. They are touring the world and will be cycling for several years. I'll need an early start in the morning to catch the train to Denali. Check in is at 7:15 so I anticipate heading out of the campground by 6:30. The weather has recovered during the day and this evening is nearly cloudless. I hope it will be a clear day for tomorrow's scenic train ride. Your intrepid traveler, Roger on the Chena 
Rode to the train depot in Fairbanks with a stop at McD's for breakfast. A letdown from Alaskan sourdough pancakes, but convenient. The train left Fairbanks at 8:15 and arrived in Denali around noon. The train was clean, modern and comfortable. The car had a dome section for great views. This was a nice way to travel. At the Denali station, I got my bike and gear all back together and headed for the Park visitors center. I arranged to get a camp site for two nights at Sanctuary River Campground which is 22 miles into the Park and about 10 miles further in then where we camped here three years ago with the rented motorhome. The guy who sold me the campground ticket didn't know the Park rules and tried to tell me I couldn't ride a bicycle into the Park, that I'd have to take the bus in. He finally checked with a supervisor and I was all set to go. The ride in was a lot of uphill, as my average speed suggests. The last 10 miles were gravel which is also the road surface further into the Park.    There is one other couple here at the campground--they took the bus in and are here for several days doing day hikes. They are from Chicago. The campground has a food locker (for bear protection), a port-o-potty but no water (the dummy at the visitor center told me there was), so I'm glad I have my filter. Had New Orleans style dirty rice and a bottle of cabernet for dinner--Ah, wilderness! Yours back in the wilds, Roger in Denali 
This morning began clear and crisp. I bundled up and set out from camp to explore the Park. Access to the Park is fairly restrictive. Visitors must travel on school bus style park vehicles or hike or bike. Campers can sign up for the camper bus and travel from site to site that way. On a bicycle, the only restriction is that you must stay on the road. Well, this is no restriction at all. The road is primarily hard packed gravel and a very suitable surface for my touring bike. A mountain bike would be ideally suited for this road. I rode in about 23 miles from my campsite to Polychrome Pass (this makes a total of about 46 miles into the park). I saw the great one, Mount McKinley. Although I'd seen it several times on the trip three years ago, it was still an awe inspiring sight.    Saw lots of caribou grazing on the tundra vegetation. As I was climbing the last curve to Polychrome Pass, two Dall sheep rams came onto the road about 50 feet in front of me. I looked at them and their horns which come out, curve down and terminate in points. I looked down at my handle bars which come out, curve down and terminate in points. I'm thinking, "Are these guys at all territorial? Will they think my Trek is some sort of robo-ram?" I didn't want to get much closer. At that moment, a park bus approached from behind me. I pulled in behind the bus. A mini-van with two photographers came in behind me. So, now we had a motley parade slowly progressing up Polychrome Pass: two Dall rams setting the pace, a bus full of excited and camera clicking tourists, a cyclist, and a mini-van. After about a quarter mile of this, the rams decided to abandon the road. As I passed the rams (I was at this point perhaps 15-20 feet from them) one gave me a sheepy eye-to-eye look. I gave him a bear tooth smile and kept real close to the bus.    All of this, as I mentioned, occurred at Polychrome Pass. All of the park is postcard scenery but this pass is a postcard's postcard. I ate lunch (I'd packed a peanut butter burrito) at the pass and then headed back to my camp site at Sanctuary River. It was virtually all down hill back to camp; a fun ride, a Tour DeNali. I was the only cyclist on the road this day (at least I didn't see or hear of any others). Cycling is a great way to see this park, much more up close and personal than the park bus service. Saw no bears. Ramming right along, Roger in Denali National Park 
Cold this morning--frost on everything and thin ice on the still waters.    Packed everything up and bundled up for the ride out of the park. The sky was pristine and I knew I'd be stripping off clothes quickly as the sun rose and I started peddling uphill (the ride out of the park was mostly downhill but there were a few uphill sections early on). I was rewarded on this clear morning with several views of Mt. McKinley. It was distant, cloud-like; a ghostly presence, peeking over the Alaska Range.  Also, some caribou were feeding along the road so I got to see them real close (20 or 30 feet). As I was coming down an incline, there was a bus stopped heading into the park. If there's a stopped bus, there's wildlife nearby. I could not see anything and was concerned there might be a bear near the road. I stopped to ask the driver what people were watching. "Dall sheep up on the mountain," he replied. Well, I'd seen Dall sheep so was about to go on when the bus driver asked about my trailer. He apparently had cycled some in the park and was researching options to carry equipment. After a vigorous downhill run, I stopped at the visitors center and made train reservations for tomorrow back to Anchorage. That meant spending the night in the tourist community of Denali Park (all it is is hotels, cabins, RV parks, shops, restaurants, etc. to handle the park visitors and park overflow). I'm staying at the Sourdough Cabins. I very much needed to do a laundry; since Sourdough Cabins lacks this facility, I went to the hotel next door. After loading my things in the washing machine, I sat outside the laundry room working on email messages. A man stops by, intrigued with my Pocketmail device. I explained to him what I was doing and that as I was cycling this device was a lot easier to carry and use than a laptop computer. He commented that he'd seen a cyclist in the park this morning who had talked to the driver of his bus about the wildlife they were watching. I asked, "Was the cyclist pulling a trailer with an American flag?" He said yes and I said that was I. As I think about that, I likely saw and waved to hundreds of bus riders over the last three days, some of whom I observed taking my picture. I guess I've become an anonymous celebrity of sorts. Sourdough Cabins are on the Nenana River. (For a little perspective, the Chena, on which I camped in Fairbanks, flows into the Tanana near Fairbanks. The Tanana joins the Nenana which then flows on to the Yukon River.) Here, the Nenana forms a canyon. I strolled down to the river and watched a slew of rafters bouncing through the rapids. There's a huge assortment of rocks in the river bed--granite, basalt, schiss, quartz, conglomerate. It's like the Nenana is the bottom of the glacial funnel and all the debris drops here. I didn't see any gold nuggets peeking out of the sand. Had a great pizza for dinner. I am taking the train to Anchorage tomorrow. Weather is GREAT! Your showered and rested traveler, Roger on the Nenana. 
Today was an all day train ride to Anchorage. I arrived at the Denali train depot about 11 to get my ticket and check in. I hear behind me, "Hey Roger!" It was the couple from Chicago with whom I camped at Sanctuary River. They decided to break camp a day early, head to Anchorage, rent a car and drive to Seward. The train ride was 8 hours, but better than an 8-hour flight. Train seats have lots of room, you can move around and you can eat/drink whenever (and pretty much whatever) you want.    On a train ride like this, you can't help but noticing that there is a lot of wilderness up here.  We arrived around in Anchorage around 8 pm. Here I was, back at the same train station I'd started out from on my way to Valdez. Seems like months ago. I rode to the motel where I had made reservations. This is "John's Motel & RV Park." It looks quite the dump from the outside but the room is quite clean and nice. There's even a TV that gets multiple channels, a telephone and a refrigerator. And this is the least expensive placed I've stayed and it's in Anchorage! John, himself, checked me in. Tomorrow is going to be a busy day of errands, boxing the bike, shipping the bike, etc. As today will be the last of my cycling days (and not much of one at that), I plan to terminate my trip reports with this note. I'll write a summary/epilogue on the plane ride back home and fill you in on anything exciting that happens Friday and Saturday. Yours having completed the circle, Roger in Anchorage 
On Saturday, my flight was scheduled for 8:40 pm, so Saturday morning I checked out of John's Motel, and drove south out of Anchorage, down the Kenai penninsula to Seward, a nice little town at the head of a fjord called Resurrection Bay. Alaska continues to amaze me with its vast beauty and utter wildness. There are two philosophies of bicycle touring. Some tour to primarily get somewhere and sightseeing only as it presents itself. Others mainly sightsee, using a bicycle as their mode of transportation. I think this tour consisted of two phases. The first, getting to Fairbanks, held traveling primary and sightseeing secondary. Once I hit Fairbanks, sightseeing became primary with travel secondary. The second phase included my excursion into Denali National Park. Combining the ferry and train with cycling allowed a very flexible schedule and allowed me to do and see things that I could not have otherwise fit into a two week schedule. Animals I saw were: Steller's sea lions, bald eagles, marmots, foxes, grizzly bears, moose, caribou, Dall sheep, beaver, porcupine. Many were up close because I was on a bicycle. Alaska's a great place to tour on a bicycle. I only had two flats and both were while on paved roads. I did ride considerable distances (mostly within Denali National Park) on gravel but had no problems with this (except for dust, my bike got pretty dirty). I would have been happy to continue on. I didn't feel exhausted (on the contrary, I was just getting warmed up!). From the time I uncrated my bike until I boxed it back up, I rode 562 miles. Some of those miles were tough, some were easy; all were spectacular as new vistas and experiences opened before me. Camping went well although I ate in restaurants as often as possible. I had been worried about packing too little or too much stuff. It worked out about right. A few things I never used and a few things I wished I had. I enjoyed keeping this journal, sharing my experiences and getting notes from those follow my adventure. So, what's the next big adventure? I think I'll stick closer to home. The logistics of getting stuff (and myself) to and from Alaska absorbed a lot of time and added complications. Starting a bicycle touring trip from the end of my own driveway is considerably simpler. Killin' time between flights, Roger in Chicago
  Basics:      Specifics:  Camping  Eating  Rack Pack  Handlebar Bag/fanny Pack  On Bike  Clothing  Off Bike First Aid Kit  Miscellaneous 
   We knew things we were getting serious when it rained for the weekly ride just before the big weekend- Larry picked us up in his 4x4 and shouted us brekky at a great little cafe on the Esplanade- with the explanation that we really needed the planning time!! This guy really was going after all!! Steve had no back rack and the rear suspension system ruled out a conventional rack- he manufactured one from some aluminium lying round after being told by a bike shop it couldn't be done (trust an Aussie!!). Steve had a pair of ancient panniers picked up from a garage sale- tad small but material tough as boot leather and a very useful item. Larry had no rack either and simply opted for a back pack. I took all my panniers and tried to pick up some of the surplus. This was a credit card trip (my first) which minimised gear. Larry was looking for a good night meal (weren't we all??) and also a mixed grill brekky. Wow!! I initially tried to book into the Theebine pub but all beds were taken by macadamia-picking backpackers. So it was a few more k's south to Gunalda pub for the night- dearer- but they looked after us pretty well. (When we finally got to Theebine it turned out the nut picking had finished and we could have stopped there anyway!!) The extra distance put a little more pressure on us but we survived! Hit the Road Jack...er Larry Steve and Dave...   
It was rather amusing that because country police stations are now only open limited hours I found the front door locked  and had to ring the station on my mobile phone (standing literally only a few feet away) to tell the duty officer what we were doing. Larry suddenly realised we were about to depart civilization and rushed around to the local cafe to stock up on Rocky Road bars and cans of Coke (his thoughtfulness was greatly appreciated!!) We rode down the Bruce Highway for the first few k's to the Bauple turn-off. The shoulders are pretty wide here and there was no great drama. We'd hardly turned for Bauple when the worms made their presence felt.    From memory it was only a few more pleasant k's along tree-lined roads before we reached Bauple. Our destination here was the Museum. Walkers Band played here during the opening ceremony by the Queensland Governor Major General Peter Arnison in 2001 and I wanted to check it out more thoroughly. It is set in a long narrow island in the middle of the road between the traffic lanes with beautiful parklands, old machinery and BBQs and picnic tables. This road originally was the main highway passing through the town.    Show links to this Hide links to this        It seems hard to believe looking how small the town is now that there was once a busy sugar mill processing cane from a wide area. There was a series of cane tram tracks for transporting the cane from the farms to the mill and one of the old locos is now in the Museum grounds. We found one of the cuttings for one track as we rode south out of town. There was also a branch line to the Queensland Railways at Gundiah which was used to bring in cane from other areas and take bagged sugar out. all of this can be seen at the Museum.    The Museum folk looked after us wonderfully well even sharing a cuppa with us. We realised though we would have to finally make a move and we set off south thorugh a stand of tall pines heading for the highway. Here we clipped on our tail-lights and rode straight across the highway and headed down the Bauple-Woologa road as far as the Paterson turn-off. Sight of the century was watching Larry riding the double-line in the centre of the road on the crest of one hill. Seems he has been dying to do that ever since he was a kid. Then going downhill he threw his legs over the handlebars and let out a hari-raising "Whoopee"". Very therapeutic for all of us!!  Finally we turned left at the Gundiah-Theebine crossroads and headed south for Paterson. Seems hard to believe that some railway sidings which gave their name to districts have disappeared to the point where you can't even find a couple of old stumps to mark their existence. Lunch was eaten beside the road near Paterson, and then on to Kanyan and Theebine.      If only buildings could talk! I have a feeling this pub could certainly tell some yarns!! In its heyday it had a reputation. Thankfully little has been done to the pub over the years and so it is pretty original. The current owners are working hard to restore it to its heritage splendour. Below is the coloured glass window behind the main inside staircase.     Many of these country pubs now are making a comeback catering to busloads of tourists and Theebine often has a dining room full of locals for dinner on the weekend.      The run from Theebine to Gunalda was fairly uneventful apart from a couple of doozy hills that certainly knocked the stuffing out of us coming at the end of the day. One hill I noticed cramps starting to set in so I hastily skolled some sports drink. Interesting to ride over a new major rail cutting on the edge of town- the former railway yards in town (along with station and residences and other buildings) all disappeared when the line was straightened and all minor railway  stations were closed.    We were well-looked after at Gunalda pub- sumptuous buffet dinner for only a few of us- they certainly knew how to cook. The Gunalda pub is very old although it has had major renovations over the years. Somewhere along the line I realised there was no centre hallway- the bedrooms opened straight on to the verandah. I've seen many shearers quarter like that before but never a pub. Speaks of the times (not long ago) in the country when you never locked a house- never needed to- and often couldn't lock many houses. It was a cold night but I slept with the bedroom french doors open so I could hear the trains pass through the edge of town. I drew the short straw for the double bed in a room on my own- might have been mistaken but thought I heard muttered comments about snoring. The lies some people spread!! 
   As we wended our way north again I felt a deviation to Dickabram Bridge on the Mary River at Miva was in order. Neville and I had passed through here in reverse direction on our earlier trip through here  (see http://www.crazyguyonabike.com/doc/Broweena2003 ). While we were enjoying an early smokoh a bellow of diesel engines climbing a grade at Sexton behind Miva made us sit up- instantly we knew it was something far bigger than a semi and I quickly grabbed Steve's digital camera and bolted for the bridge. Sure enough before long came this double header train with an incredibly long string of cattle wagons.          As we headed north we bypassed the detours to Theebine and Kanyan and headed straight for Paterson. There is quite a climb behind Theebine with beautful views of the mountains to the west and to the east we could see Theebine township and the two-storey pub in the distance.    Show links to this Hide links to this      Back to the point where we turned off the Bauple-Woolooga Rd to head south the day before. Now we were heading north for Gundiah and Tiaro again. Last trip Neville and I had ridden out to the Mary River at Gundiah but we were pushing for time now so I gave it a miss and we headed straight for the pub. Larry stunned the publican by asking for tea and toasted sandwiches- first time ever apparently- but he produced same in style and we had high lunch on the pub verandah. At one point we were entertained by the antics of a carload of guys who had spent the previous night investigating the inside of a large number of bottles of grog out at some obscure campsite. It seems they were in town for some of the "hair of the dog that bit them"!!      The trip back to Tiaro was fairly uneventful apart from one last mongrel hill not far from town. We were all still in pretty reasonable shape- and Larry was even quite chirpy. No telling these suited businessman- more to them than meets the eye. We were pushing the bikes about halfway up this hill when a Scotsman rockets past- he was much older than us, in athletic gear and still riding like the clappers. "Och what be wrrrrong with you lads- I be much older than you and I still be riding!!" Yeah whatever!! We admired his physical condition but I could never ride like that- no matter how much I rode!! Nice to dream about I suppose!     
This was my first credit card trip and I enjoyed it. Because it was winter I still seemed to carry too much stuff- mainly clothing (I hate being cold and it sends my asthma haywire). I found credit card touring is great for the change of pace- someone else does the cooking etc- edmittedly for many people now such a holiday is the norm. However for me from a single income family I couldn't justify it on a regular basis- particularly when it is only me (and not the two of us) getting the benefit (unless peace and quiet for the spouse is regarded as a benefit- maybe there's a thought!!).  One interesting discovery- credit card touring is much more affordable if you head for the out of the way places- Theebine pub for example the three of us could have doshed down for the night in their three-bed room at $25Au for the room for the night- $8 a night each. Motels vary from $50-$80 a night for a room. Pub meals are often cheap too- $6-$10 Au- and in these quiet country pubs you often get well looked-after. So in future as I plan trips I will consider cheap accomodation in pubs as a possible alternative. Perhaps the economic approach would be to self-cater through the day- ensuring appropriate food for riding and economy- and buy a night meal and bed. Steve's garage-sale panniers and home-made rack worked well. Larry's "garage sale clunker" was a tad low in gearing for cruising but rode well and never hesitated. I had borrowed the bike earlier and wrecked the original saddle- the replacement gel seat made it much more comfortable to ride. However a rear rack at least is a must- Larry found the backpack uncomfortable over any distance. There are a couple of places here where I am sure we can pick one up second-hand easily. I was using home-made panniers in the front for the second time and apart from a tendency to slip they performed well. The slipping was rectified by changing how I tied them on. My daughter-i-l made them from a couple of old fishing bags and I found they needed to be kept pretty well full to keep them in shape and out of the spokes. Perhaps I need to put a stiffener in the back. Just putting this journal together has made me quite nostalgic- I think I'll ride the area again before too long- and sample Theebine pub's hospitality!!
http://www.users.bigpond.com/museduca/murray%20to%20mtns%20rail/murtomountains%20rail%20trail.html I've always enjoyed bike-riding as a kid- very occasionally in adult years- somewhere over the last few years I became interestd in the concept of touring- particularly encouraged by websites such as Ken Kifer's. 2002 and the M to M Trail was the spark that ignited the flame. Christmas 2002 saw me succumb to a fit of shoppers fever as the Christmas music rose to a crescendo and I rushed off to our local bike shop to put an Avanti Discovery crossbike complete with racks and panniers on lay-by. A thoughtful tax cheque from Mr Howard shortly after saw my Avanti home and me on the road.  I was planning a three day ride at Easter near Brisbane- but I needed something shorter locally to test everything out while having a good time in the process. Where we live at the seaside we are almost out on a peninsula- there are a couple of local rides to nearby beaches around 40 to 70 K return but nothing of an overnight nature. To ride anywhere else means going on busy highways back to the hinterland. So my short ride would entail a car ferry to the start point. I found Peter Gordon's site http://homepage.powerup.com.au/~gordonp/ a great inspiration- he has created these rides around South-East Queensland which use mostly secondary roads to dodge the traffic and find places of interest. So I pored over endless maps of the Wide Bay region vectoring in factors such as length of ride, possible camp spots, points of interest etc. The ride I finally created is shown here.    The Brooweena-Woologa Rd is comparatively remote but scenically very attractive with hills either side of the road (plus we discovered some crossing the road!!) The short stretch on the Bauple-Woolooga Rd is narrow and hilly and does carry quite a deal of traffic as it is a shortcut between the Bruce and Wide Bay Highways. The Theebine area is easy riding and minimal traffic- past Gundiah heading to Tiaro the hills pick up. The last stretch Mungar to Maryborough is very hilly. I decided to take pot luck on a camping spot along a creek somewhere (since discovered this is called "stealth camping")- the final outcome of this was quite funny. Next question- who to ride with?? Tried a few mates but they broke out in a cold sweat and hot flushes just thinking about it. Finally conned Neville a long-suffering mate and fellow muso who was half-used to my crazy ideas. He has a Repco (I think??) bike about 10 years old which still rides very well- it had a rear rack which Nev supplemented with a backpack. We were both busy with work right up to the last-minute so planning was minimal- I offered to bring shared gear such as cooking gear, tent and the like and Nev his personal gear and some nibblies.  Hit the Road Jack... 
We picked up Nev bright and early and headed off for Brooweena. I wasn't impressed when I realised we had a fairly stiff hill within sight of the car- wouldn't look good if we walked it no matter how steep. I remember looking forward to the trip with anticipation mixed with apprehension. Great time ahead- what if we have a breakdown?? We would be out of mobile range for most of the time (geographically most of Australia is out of mobile range!)and farms were pretty scattered along the first part of the trip.    My fears were groundless. It took around four hours to cover those 44 k's- almost all bitumen road, and including a lunch break by the side of the road. Traffic was minimal so we had a peaceful meal. It seemed to me that even with downhill and uphill the land seemed to gradually fall towards Woolooga. Some of the downs were spectacular for us little ducks- 50 k's with laden bikes rocketing downhill with a tiny single lane bridge at the bottom and no side rails. Little scope to swerve off at the last minute. From memory we arrived on the Bauple-Woolooga Rd somewhere after 1pm. At this point we turned towards Bauple. This stretch of the road required vigilance- it is hilly, sometimes single lane and always narrow, and cars seemed to materialise from either direction out of nowhere. When we reached the Miva turn we took a breather on a gravel heap and sucked out the last Mars bars out of their packets. By this time of day it was pretty hot.  While taking a rest we saw a spectacular error of judgement- could have been nasty. The visibility is poor here and the two side roads- Miva and Glen Echo have "give way" signs. A van roared up the Miva turn and shot straight across the main road down the Glen Echo turn without even slowing. Not many seconds after a car doing 100 ks'hr came down the main road towards us. A few seconds earlier and it would have collected the van- and thrown it straight onto us.      After the bustle of the Bauple-Woolooga Rd we appreciated the quiet gravel Miva Rd. As we came down the hill into Miva township we stopped to chat with one of the locals and gain a picture of the area. Miva now is just a few houses and a CWA hall- hard to believe once there was a very busy general store, butcher, cream carrier and garage, and railway station (on the Kingaroy Branch Line). Just after Miva is the historic Dickabram Bridge and picnic area on the Mary River where we stopped for a cuppa and a breather. The bridge was built in the 1880's with a steel centre span and timber spans either side. As I remember it is one of only two combined road/rail bridges left in Queensland. Up until the 1970's a gatekeeper lived in a Railway House on the far side of the bridge and they used to open the road gates onto the bridge every time a car wanted to drive over. When rail traffic dropped and the gatekeeper was removed the Railway fitted a timber kerb to the bridge which separated the road from the rail. On a later ride we were fortunate enough to see a train crossing this bridge. (See        By now the afternoon was well advanced, we felt like baked potatoes and we were hanging out for a cold drink. As we left Dickabram for Theebine pub I noticed a long low cloud mass to the south- storms well away from us I thought. The riding here is comparatively flat and quite enjoyable. Eventually the two-storey historic Theebine pub and surrounding township hove into view and we parked the bikes along the front paling fence and staggered in for well-earned cold drink.     The current lessees have only owned the pub for a short time and are doing wonders to restore it to its former glory. Fortunately it has never really been altered much over the years so it is pretty well original and loaded with character. The Kingaroy branch line turns off the main Northern railway line here. I have heard riotous stories about the Theebine pub from folks riding the Kingaroy line- travelling from the south they had to wait at Theebine for the Kingaroy train to arrive from Maryborough. Nev and I would liked to have lingered longer but we needed to find a camp spot so we stepped outside to push off. When we reached the bikes I looked up- and gasped. The storm which recently was down on the horizon was now right overhead and ugly. Find somewhere to stop and find it fast- certainly nothing outdoors now!! In hindsight- why didn't we just stop at the pub? We've since discovered their accomodation is very cheap!! We headed for Kanyan and pedalled for all we worth. Somewhere down the road Neville called out "Car behind- I can see the lights"   Brief pause  "Hang on the lights have moved to one side!!" Suddenly the north-bound Sunlander passenger train roared past- oops!!  At Kanyan we spotted an old farm shed- hmmm- pretty bleak- passed it up. Around another corner and there was the familiar cream shed found at so many farm front gates where in past years the cans of cream were placed for the carter to pick up. Beggars couldn't be choosers- Nev was still shy but I could hear the storm rumbling and banging right overhead. We turned in and headed up the track to a very amused farmer. Twin brothers lived on this farm and they were most hospitable. I discovered I had worked at the same school as one of the farmer's wives once- although on different days. The other brother was a bachelor with his own house and a very palatial back patio complete with comfy furniture and hot and cold shower. Nev and I accepted his offer with alacrity. We had barely wheeled the bikes in under the patio when all hell broke loose overhead. The storm swung around and came back several times in the course of the night. However we were snug as bugs in a rug. A good hot shower, leisurely tea and a pile of books. What an evening. When our host had realised we were interested in the history of the area (including the Miva store where he had worked for many years) he dug out all his local history books (and a spare pair of specs for Nev- I always have an old pair of reading glasses in my panniers). We sprawled out in the comfy arm chairs and read to the music of the rain on the roof. I slept well for the night on my Thermarest self-inflating mattress I bought at Wangaratta in 2002. Neville only had one of those thin foam mats and in the early hours I heard him drag the armchairs together for a makeshift bed. Whatever works!! 
  Morning looked ominous with heavy cloud but within an hour or so of sunrise the cloud had burned away and it was another glorious day. We had nearly finished packing when our genial host surfaced- so we chatted some more before pushing off.       As we came towards Patterson the hills started to appear again- however they still weren't too bad. Before long we had reached the major crossroads on the Bauple-Woolooga Rd and a couple of kilometres across was the the one-teacher Gundiah State School with Bauple Mtn in the background. I have fond memories of teaching music here one hour a week for about 6 months in 2000. In front of Gundiah State School is the local Sports Ground- the old timber Theebine Railway Station was moved here as a clubhouse some years ago.       While teaching at Gundiah I used to drive sometimes down to the bridge on the Mary River- not far- only a few k's so I suggested we ride down there and check it out. I had forgotten the three steep hills in those few kilometres!! However it is a very pretty area and it has been a popular camping spot for many years- not too sure about now looking at the "no camping" sign on the gate. By the time we mastered those hills- twice!!- a quick trip to the Gundiah pub was in order. When the publican sensed our interest in the pub he brought out a folder of pics and newspaper clippings which held our interest for an hour or more. The original pub at Gootchie (which I think would have been a Cobb and Co coach stop) was shifted up to Gundiah when the railway was built from Maryborough to Gympie in the 1880's. This original pub seemed to be in the Railway yards and doubled as refreshment rooms. Later after it burnt the pub was rebuilt in its present spot just off the yards.    Tiaro on the Bruce Highway was only a few k's up the road with only a couple of really nasty hills near town. Neville I think never pushed his bike up any hill- rode every one to the top and then did doughnuts at the top waiting for me to catch up. El Slacko- never mind I got there! Interesting riding into Tiaro from the southern end- the Bruce Highway veers off to the east but the Gundiah Road points straight up the main street. Seems the original highway to the south actually passed to the west of Mt Bauple straight through Gundiah, Patterson, Theebine and Gunalda. Later rebuilds saw the highway built on the eastern side of Mt Bauple and bypassing all the towns. Tiaro is one of the few towns with the Bruce Highway still passing through- very busy- cyclists beware. We cooked a good pasta lunch in the park and rang home to our pick-up agency.  "Tiaro already?? Well you can ride yourselves into Maryborough then!!"   "Uh huh!!" Nothing like encouragement!!    Mungar here we come. The Mary River runs behinds Tiaro and there was a very steep run to the bottom (easy on the brakes) and then across a bridge with no side rails (quite a novel sensation). The first part of this ride was flat and easy. By Antigua Hall the hills were picking up again and we had a breather on the landing of the Hall. We'd bought a map of Tiaro Shire at the Information Centre and I was looking for a track to the steel Railway Bridge on the Mary River at Antigua but no luck.  Mungar township we did a quick lap of honour to check out the town. Like so many of these towns as the shop, pub and various other businesses closed the towns really dwindled. Mungar still has a fairly large State School (I taught music here at the same time as at Gundiah- and thoroughly enjoyed it) and the Monto branch line leaves the main northern railway in the railway yards here.  Mungar to Maryborough has some doozy hills and we were really starting to feel the pinch. However Nev is never one to complain and I always seem to keep chundering on. When I taught at Mungar I remember one visiting teacher who used to come out from Maryborough on his racing treddly and I remember passing him on the way back into town many times- he seemed to eat those hills. Admittedly he was ex-PE and very fit!! One interesting sight on the way in was Yerra Hall- built in the 1880's in prosperous times when there was a local sugar mill and the railway was going through- I think it is the only country hall I have seen in Queensland made of brick. Finally Maryborough West Railway Station and the Biggenden road hove into view- we had beaten the last hill and more or less completed a circuit (we had been dropped off about 40k's down this road the previous day). The rest was history- coasted into town and felt quite good about weekend out!! 
Equipment wise I based my gear on my Victoria trip and we seemed to have everything. Second morning in Vic I rememember rummaging around on my hands and knees in my tiny tent almost having panic attacks lost in this welter of gear everywhere. So I spent an hour grouping everything together and using a set pattern loading the packs. Haven't had a wobbly since.  Packing order roughly is one rear pannier- sleeping bag, mess kit, tin billy other rear pannier- mainly food grouped in several plastic shopping bags-            easy to find- just grab the right bag one front pannier- clothes and first aid kit in large pencil case other front pannier- skivvy, flannel jacket, spray jacket etc plus various sundries scattered around the pockets rear rack bag- heavy stuff- tent, fly, gas stove and cylinder, padlock and chain, pump, nibblies in pocket nearest saddle Stove needs to have windshield made- takes forever to boil and wastes much gas when wind blowing. Also gradually getting into habit of measuring exact amout of water needed into billy- again saves time and gas. Trip successful?? In my opinion definitely- and had a ball.
     Why am I doing this? I have always had a streak of wanderlust. Some of my fondest memories of my misspent years are of my hitch-hiking trips across the US, a summer spent climbing in Yosemite, campfires in the Rocky Mountains, etc. Lately, the need to recapture the spirit has grown in me. (I know what you thinking... Mid-life crisis (note to self: burn the AARP card)). So why am I taking a 13 year old kid with me? Hey, someone has to carry all the gear. Besides, It will be good to have someone responsible along with me. I will try to update this journal as often as possible from the road, so please comeback and check it out.

Note: Washington doesn't have a bottle law and the shoulders are loaded with broken glass. I had forgotten what a benefit NY's bottle law has been for cyclists.         
    
  
    
      
    

  
Honeyman has some dunes that are supposed tobe a lot of fun, but we got into camp too late to enjoy them. The idea of more climbing wasn't all that interesting anyways. The girls from last night were already at the campsite as were 2 non-biker guys, and another non-biker with a dog. I say 'non-biker' instead of 'hiker' because it was not clear to me that any of the non-bikers were not just taking advantage of the system and either hitchhiked or parked nearby and walked into the park. At dusk another biker showed up on a mountain bike pulling a Bob (BeastOfBurden) trailer. His name was Mike McCann (www.MikeLikeBike.com) and Cal and I quickly became friends with him. The girls, Mike, Cal, and I stayed up till midnight shooting the breeze. After 11:00 a transient couple appeared at the hiker/biker site with their 3! dogs. Didn't sleep well with the ensuing cacophony. The pre-dawn coughing fit by one of the smokers didn't help either. The transients moved out a little after dawn.     



                

  
          
    
    
Camp was interesting this evening. When we registered we were told there was a family squatting in the Hiker/Biker area and a ranger would be along to move them out. Thomas and Sarah, a young couple from Portland heading to SF, were already there, Bill, a single guy who was the only coastal rider we could keep apace with, and Max from last night. Free Showers! (Especially since there were no showers last night.) The squatters walked thru the campsite a few times but when the ranger came they were nowhere to be found.  Ramin and fruit for dinner. At bedtime Sarah's sleeping bag came up missing.  I had been on the picnic table. Under the assumption that the squatters had a  hand it the bags disappearance we searched the surronding trees and brush  thinking that maybe they had just chucked it to be retreived at a later time,  but no luck. Made sure to lock the bikes together before we went to sleep.  Max talked on his cell phone for about an hour arranging transportation in  SF (I could have killed him.)     
 
At last we reached the Golden Gate Bridge. The first half was in sunlight and the second was shrouded in fog. We stopped partway oveer so Cal could spit off the bridge. I have to admit this was pretty interesting. A good gob would drop 30 or 40 feet and then would get caught by the wind coming under the bridge and would take off horizontally. There must be someplace over in Oakland that is covered with spit. Cal was annoyed by all the tourists on  rented bikes but we got behind a maintenance vehicle which plowed through all  the gawkers. In the Parking lot on the other side of the bridge, I gave Cal  a congratulatory kiss, but this disgusted him. Rode thru quiet residential  areas in SF out to the coast, watched some surfers, climbed a big but easy  hill over Daly City, and dropped down Pacifica. We got directions from one of  the many people who have stopped and asked Cal about his trip. Ate a pizza,  and rode toward my brother's house. I missed a subtle turn off and ended up  climbing a very big hard hill. Had to ask directions from a lady in her yard  and she said " oh no, you have to go all the way back down the hill...".  Drat. Back tracked and got to my brother's street. After 1100 miles of never  having to surrender my pride and push the bike up a hill, I was defeated by  the last 100 yards. How ignominious. Cal, however, made it up (but with no  whistling). Finito.
Another good reason was Peter Gordon's superb website http://homepage.powerup.com.au/~gordonp/ which comprehensively details all sorts of tours through South-East Queensland. My trip was an amalgam of about three of Peter's varied to suit my tastes and time. http://homepage.powerup.com.au/~gordonp/Ipswich/Harrisville/desc.html http://homepage.powerup.com.au/~gordonp/Ipswich/Century/desc.html http://homepage.powerup.com.au/~gordonp/Ipswich/Boonah/desc.html This trip was also significant for me because it represented my first solo trip on my own bike and was a test of the ideas and gear I had accumulated to date. I had ridden a weekend a couple of weeks earlier with a mate (see "RIDING MY OWN BACKYARD- Brooweena to Tiaro the Long Way") and this Ipswich ride took my abilities and stamina another step forward. Forward ho.....   
Quite a novel experience for me riding through the One Mile in Ipswich and out through Churchill past the old saleyards (and what was the start of the Fassifern Valley Railway before it was pulled up!) Finally reached the Boonah Road proper- and it really was "head down and tail up"- headwinds for most of the day!! Traffic on the early part of the road was busy but bearable. Still can't quantify my feelings that day- third long ride so no great problem but I think it was still all very new for me. First break was at Peak Crossing store. Finally reached Boonah early afternoon- 44K's. Been hearing about Boonah for thirty years from in-laws so did "lap of honour" around town. Checked out the great little Information Centre and then headed for Kalbar. Fascinated by Kalbar- whole town seems to be strung out along either side of one road. Then off to Harrisville. Discovered going through this stretch one vital principle- if a map shows minor roads with major roads some distance away either side- you can bet your bottom dollar there are mountains in the middle, the major roads are skirting them and the minor road goes straight over the top!! Some doozy hills on the way to Harrisville.          Harrisville is particularly important in the in-law saga. Grandfather (paternal side) lived there for many years along with other rellies from both sides of the in-laws. Somewhere between the wars grandfather found some brass band instruments stashed away in the Harrisville Hall and formed up the Warril View Band of a dozen or so players- grandfather on bass and my father-in-law on cornet being two of the players. They played at all sorts of functions including a wedding once and the Warril View Show (I think it was called). My wife and two of her brothers were born in the little cottage hospital there. Much of the farm business including livestock sales were transacted there and even today one cousin-in-law still grows lucerne on an irrigation block on the edge of town. By the time I rode out of Harrisville the light was waning but I knew I was nearly at my destination. It was only a few k's to Warril View (on the main Ipswich-Warwick Highway) and then a few more k's to Trevor and Myra's farm- and my long-suffering better half!! After 83 klicks a hot shower went down very well- and Myra even had Voltaren for a dicky knee!! Bed never felt so good but I was pleased with my progress to date.   
  Regardless of what I have done the previous day I seem to rise early- must be the ADD- the body can't stand still- and today my hyperactivity was rewarded with a beautiful (if rather drought-stricken) picture postcard landscape looking back towards Cunninghams Gap and the Fassifern Valley. I pushed off early knowing this would be a fairly long day also, and I was riding through new territory so I needed time to make (and correct!) a few mistakes. I was encouraged with a steep hill straight off the farm over Cunningham's Lookout. I passed the T-junction leading to Coleyville where my wife grew up- before I left we had spotted one of the cousins driving back towards Harrisville so I didn't turn to Coleyville but kept on for Rosewood. Discovered later he merely went to the shop at Warril View and had in fact then gone back home and waited for me. Oops! The 27 K run to Rosewood was uneventful- I loved the long downhill run into town. Rosewood fascinated me. On the way through town I passed the school where my better half and her brothers used to come once a week in late primary school for manual arts and domestic science- their transport a truck covered in at the back and fitted with forms- ala 1950's school bus.     The locals mustn't have seen anyone in bike shorts before- they seemed rather stunned when I asked where there might be a barby to cook lunch. They were probably even more stunned later as I departed the main street- after locking the bike I had chucked the keys down my bike pants (well I had no pockets)- time to unlock again I couldn't find the keys- and there is a definite limit to how much you can scratch around inside your bikepants in a busy country main street and remain respectable- and free. I finally dragged my rack bag off the bike and sat down to rummage through it (finally deciding that was where I must have put the keys- short term memory loss!!). As I sat down I noticed a marked lump in the leg of my shorts just above the elasticised hem. Ahhh- they had slid down and almost out!! Ooops!!    Rosewood to Marburg was certainly cardio-style exercise. The climb to Tallegalla was little short of horrendous but the views from the top rewarded the effort (so did the run down the other side to Marburg). In that short distance there were some interesting sights. A flight of F-111's from Amberley Air Force Base thundered overhead. There are several open cut coal-mines up this road; and also the Rosewood Railway Museum (unfortunately not open when I passed through).  http://www.arhs-qld.org.au/rosewood/rosewood.htm A spur railway line ran from Rosewood to Marburg for many years (I am sure I can remember seeing the Marburg rail motor times up on the board at Central Station when I was a kid) and the line was also used to haul coal out from the mines. After the line closed the Rosewood Railway Museum took over a large portion of the line and they run steam trains and railmotors on it. As I climbed to Tallegalla Lookout I could see one station below- think it was Cabanda.    Marburg I have driven past countless times on the bypass- and never checked it out. A fascinating little place. The historic main intersection in town sports - a grand old pub (1881), a 1911 General Store (now a fascinating collection of bric-a-bric) and a similar-age community centre. Further up the main drag (formerly the through Toowoomba Rd) a plaque marks the spot where the local hospital stood. After Marburg I lost my bearings (sort of- well according to Peter Gordon's directions anyhow). I realised in hindsight I should have taken the road under the highway. Oh well. I headed for Minden- via the main highway! Oh hell!! Head down, tail up- lowest gear possible and ride like the wind hugging the guard rail. Minden was only over the hill and I was soon off the highway heading for Tarampa and Atkinsons Dam. This stretch was fairly flat and I quite enjoyed it. Again the sun was lowering but I was confident I would make it in time. Within a few miles of Atkinson's Dam one knee started playing up (I had chalked up 140 k's on a loaded bike with some heavy hills in two days- not too bad for this unfit duck). So out with the Voltaren- a couple of doses got me enough relief to reach the Dam. Atkinson's Dam is a small earth-wall dam built in the 60's for local irrigation. It has a large picnic area and was a popular skiing and fishing spot- until the drought. Now it is a small puddle. The campsite was reasonable- good price and store; but basic BBQ and no picnic table or light. Later in the evening however I cadged a folding chair and table so that helped. I camped near of pen of goats and found their company quite enjoyable!! 
  Fortuntely the goats slept well and so did I. I packed fairly quickly and headed off for Coominya. Somewhere around here I experienced a couple of interesting reactions from people on two wheels plus. Can't remember the exact place of the first but I do remember a semi-trailer approaching and hunkering down waiting for him to pass. Much of the road around here is pretty narrow two lane made interesting with quite a few trucks because of the small crop farming. The truck finally passed me but before I could relax a brief toot behind me warned me I had another semi waiting sitting square behind me (hadn't heard him)- he had been waiting for the first truck before overtaking me. His consideration placed him high on my list of "good blokes". The second occurred on my to Coominya next morning. Again I was waiting for an approaching car to pass and I knew this time I had a car right behind me. The bitumen was narrow, edges were very rough and while hugging the edge I wasn't going into the gravel for anybody. On these back farm roads you couldn't drive fast if you wanted to!! When the car behind was finally able to overtake me I found it full of young guys who abused the hell out of me for getting in their way. Also noticed a youngster in with them- good role modelling- nothing like perpetuating arrogance across the generations!! I'd heard of Coominya for years in connection with grape growing- folks used to come and fill their buckets when the season ended- but it seems now all the vineyards are gone. Also very disappointing to find the famous Bellevue Homestead being sold by the National Trust and no longer open for tours. However the old railway station was a sight to behold. The Brisbane Valley Railway apparently never formally closed in late 1970's- just ceased operations- so there was never a formal winding up of assets. There are railway stations and even whole railway yards left pretty much as staff walked out of them (apart from interior fittings). I had never seen such a small station before but have since realised these were the norm for small branch lines. The Coominya Station seems to have been refurbished as a Community Centre.    Lowood Railway Station is similar except that it sits in the middle of quite a busy CBD. I found this small station- almost like a dolls house- quite a novelty amongst all the shops. This station has been converted into a clubhouse for a service club. As I was there the local Council was busy pulling up some of the old Railway yards to extend the CBD car park.         If the Rosewood folks found a guy in bike shorts looking for a BBQ a trifle disconcerting- some of the Lowood folks were downright rude in their stares and comments (at least the guys working on the car park). Seems no-one ever rides a push-bike long-distance through here. Here again I found the "be suspicious of the road in the middle" idea came into play (see day 1). I had no intention of using the Brisbane Valley Highway to ride into Ipswich and there was another road in the middle- of course I would take that.  Asked a local about it- "Errr it's a bit hilly!"  "No probs- I've ridden plenty of hills!!" The local knew more than I did. To go through Glamorganvale I had this helluva climb over a range- two or three peaks in fact- and it took forty five minutes to push the bike up walking (in fact I was getting chest cramps towards the end from sheer muscular effort) but when I got to the top- the view was spectacular. If only I had known I would have eaten my lunch up here instead of in town!!    It took about forty-five seconds to rocket down the far side to the Glamorganvale Pub and as I staggered into the bar one of the locals said "Ah you finally got here!!" Seems he had passed me one stage as I was pushing. Also discovered the road beside the pub went to Marburg- the one I had missed the previous day!! Oh well file for future reference! I had a good half-hour chatting in the pub but realised I needed to push on. The road I took from here finally came out on the Brisbane Valley Highway near the new prison and I realised I had been right- no-one would want a leisurely ride very far on the this road.  Blacksoil on the Warrego Highway came all too soon and as it was approaching peak hour in Ipswich I took the chickens way out and phoned my sister-in-law for a pick-up!! I'd had a great ride and came back with plenty more experience, some good pics and some very good memories.   
It was interesting- crossed at least parts of three valley systems- Fassifern, Lockyer and Brisbane Valleys. I checked out parts of four railway systems- three defunct (Fassifern Valley, Marburg Branch, Brisbane Valley Railway)and the main Western Line to Charleville through Toowoomba. I enjoyed the unknown aspect- even if I did deviate from Peter Gordon's maps and found myself on the main Warrego Highway. Somehow I seem to have this organisational fetish where by the time I leave on a trip I have the whole thing mapped out day by day night by night which instantly creates pressure. Perhaps these Christmas hols I need to go off for a few days letting it all hang out (well not quite literally!) - follow my nose and see what happens. As always stupidity cost me money (goes with ADD- had 52 years experience there!!)- had to replace tyre and tube after burning them with exhaust; and when sister-in-law picked me I left my helmet sitting on a brick wall beside where we pulled up. Duhhh! Bike performed well and my loading seemed satisfactory. I put my heaviest gear to the rear because my front rack is light and so are the panniers so I usually put clothing and the like in the front. Also my first aid kit which is in a large pencil case. Rear pannier one side mainly food; other rear sleeping bag, billy and mess kit. Heaviest stuff in rack bag on top- tent, fly, gas stove and canister, security locks and chains. Nibblies I put in a pocket on rack bag straight behind the saddle. Debating getting a handlebar bag- don't like bumbag around my waist with wallet, mobilephone etc. However curious to know if that would affect steering. The ride has whet my appetite for more places in the area visited. There are heaps of good rides around Boonah and Moogerah Dam- discovered later an old pub at Rosevale (not far from Warril View) which could possibly be worked into a trip for accomodation. You could spend an entire hols pottering around the dams, mountains and camp areas here. Brisbane Valley well worth a visit- although would need to follow Peter Gordon's routes which would keep you on back roads off the Brisbane Valley Highway- I would call that murderous. Also found an interesting spot behind Laidley- Centenary Park which is a Council camp area and seems there would be quite a deal to see here in a short distance. It is beside the Little Liverpool Range and a mate who knows the area warned me it is hilly- adds to the interest! 

So, I have to say I am feeling totally out of place with my hybrid bike. Everyone there had road bikes. But I really *like* my hybrid. So off we went. I don't know the names of all the roads we took.  Andrejs told me it was a 22 mile ride all together, averaging about 13mph. I actually made it up all of the hills this time, instead of having to walk my bike up, like I had to a couple times last week. I had quite the workout trying to keep up with the people who showed up, and I kept up pretty well until maybe the last 5 miles. But Andrejs and Dan were very good about coming back to check on me. Thanks guys :) I felt really spent by that point. It was a lot of fun riding with a group, and Andrejs gave me some pointers about riding behind people to lessen wind resistance. It really does make a huge difference. There were a couple times where I pulled out to pass someone (those times when I wasn't the last person), but the effort of going into the wind was too much for me, and I would end right back behind them again. There was one point where I was preparing to turn left, and there was a car coming up behind me, and a car coming from the opposite direction, and I totally panicked. Not wanting to run into a car or get run over by one, I veered off the shoulder of the road right into this huge ditch filled with muck and dirty water. ACK! The car behind me went right on by, but the woman coming from the other direction stopped and asked me if I was alright. I told her I was fine, just my pride was damaged. Oh, and my shoes and socks were soaked. Oh well. That occurred about a mile away from our return point. I was glad we were almost done, because I was starting to get cold and I was exhausted. But all in all it was a wonderful ride, and I'm looking forward to next Thursday. 
Here's my public service announcement: Use your sunscreen. I'm only 27 and I had skin cancer removed this past January!! I poured about half a bottle of sunscreen on me yesterday, and surprisingly I didn't get burnt at all, even though I was out for 3.5 hours. Usually it takes me about 15 minutes to burn to a crisp. The joys of being fair-skinned..... 
I mentioned that I had all the necessary equipment to fix a flat tire, but had no idea how to do it, while another group member whipped out a few sheets of paper entitled, "How To Fix A Flat," but professed that she didn't have any equipment. We decided that between the two of us, we could probably figure it out. After a successful transplant operation was performed, we headed right on Taughannock Park Rd. and up to rt. 96. We crossed and headed up Rabbit Run Rd. This was a very peaceful, scenic portion of road. There seemed to be a lot of dogs outside last night determined to rip the tires off these strange, two-wheeled creatured that dared to invade their territory. Luckily, they were all rudely contained by their ties and runs.    At then end of Rabbit Run, we turned south onto Podunk Rd. By that time, we'd broken up into two groups. Surprising myself, I managed to stay with the lead group. We looked to our left and noticed a mass of very dark and very angry clouds making their way down the lake. We kept going and stopped at the intersection of Podunk and Perry City. Andrejs had told us to turn left, but he hadn't said which left... or we hadn't heard. So, as he caught up to us, someone said, "Do you mean this left?" To which he replied, "No, I meant the last left. But let's go up Iradell Rd. Let's do something...... heroic." The rest of us looked at each other skeptically and told him that we really could turn around and go back to the last left. It wasn't that far!!! Andrejs just smiled and continued on. Okay, so there was a pretty good size hill on Iradell, but it really wasn't all that horrible. After I reached the top of the hill I caught my second wind. The rest of the ride seemed pretty easy, as it was mostly downhill. Those few flat miles along Dubois Rd. on the way back always crush me, though. A few of the other riders also concurred with me on this. We arrived back at the meeting point at approximately 7:40pm and went our separate ways. All in all, another beautiful ride, and my most enjoyable one yet, I think. 
We took off in our usual direction, down DuBois Rd., where we were met by another biker, waiting for us at the end of his driveway! I don't know if we were going slower than usual, or if I'm just getting stronger, because it seemed like we were going at a really leisurely pace down DuBois Rd., turned left on Kraft, and went up this killer short, but very steep, hill, which I'm getting much better at with each ride. Took a quick right onto Willow creek. We sped down Willow creek, as most of that is at a slight decline, took a left onto Gorge Rd and started up a fairly challenging hill. We went down some more back roads until we came out in Trumansburg, where Not My Dad's ice cream stand is located. Sarah and I were ready to stop and put in an order! But we continued on, across 96 and into "farmland." I not quite sure what the roads are we took out there. I'm looking at Mapquest right now, and I still can't quite figure it out! Oh well.... I know we went by a big dairy farm and upset all the cows. They were all standing there peacefully chewing their cuds, minding their own business, and then we rowdy bikers came along and sent them all into a mini-stampede away from the road. Then there was a really tough little jack russell from the same farm that ran along side the road barking at us. I think he was protecting his cows. :)    The ride was pretty uneventful, but it was very pleasant. We came up to the top of one fairly long hill, and Andrejs encouraged us to stop and look back, to see what we'd accomplished. The view was amazing, and it was really great to know that you can climb a hill like that. About 2/3 of the way through the ride, I realized my foul mood had been completely replaced by a much better feeling of exhileration. It's amazing what some fresh air, exercise, and good company can do for your spirits! 
So, I arrived at the supermarket in Moravia, after a late start, thanks to the ATM machine at the P&C on Hancock St. that ate my debit card this morning. (No, I didn't get it back.) I arrived and there was only one person there, so I was worried that they had already left!! But no, we waited a few more minutes, and a whole gaggle of FLCC'ers came round the corner of the market. So I waited 'til most of them passed and fell into line. We went up a gradual ascent out of town. I think you go maybe 5 or 10 miles, and then you can see Owasco lake for most of the ride. It was very calm today, silver and shimmery, and smooth as glass, almost. Perfect for water skiing, although a bit cold still, I'm sure! The eastern side of the lake has really great terrain. It's very rolly, so we were constantly going up and down little hills. It makes for very fun riding. There isn't too much traffic on Rockefeller road until about 5 miles from the intersection with 38A, so I was able to get a lot of talking done with Dan, heh. We discussed everything from our Romanian roots, to bikes & components, to our kids. Along the tops of some of the hills, we looked down on Owasco lake and kicked ourselves for not having brought our cameras along with us. I have an idea to someday perhaps write book, or something, with photographs of the area. Although, I know someone's already done one of the FingerLakes area, so it'd have to be something more unique. Anyway, I just can't express with words how absolutely beautiful this area is during the summer. It almost makes putting up with winters like this past one worth it.  Dan and I eventually turned onto 38... A? I think it is, and caught a straggler who thought he had made a wrong turn somewhere. So, he rode on with us a bit, until we came across a group of FLCC'ers who were helping repair a flat tire. After a harsh reminder of sudden braking techniques (translation, I was going a lot faster than I thought I was and almost flew over my handlebars), we stopped and offered assistance. Or should I say, we stood around and mused at the old joke of "How many FLCC'ers does it take to change a flat tire?" since there were 6 of us there, and only 2 people were actually fixing the tire! After that was fixed, we continued on our way and met up with the rest of the members at the little mini-mart on the traffic circle in Auburn. We started back down the lake towards Moravia. Although the terrain is not as fun on this side, the scenery is better, in my opinion. It's very flat for about 5 miles, and then there's a long, gradual hill that lasts a couple miles, and then of course the really cool descent on the other side where one can build up quite a bit of speed. There are quite a few little waterfalls along this side of the lake. There probably are on the other side as well, they just can't be seen from that road. We caught up to a few more FLCC'ers closer to Moravia... one woman who was having trouble with her chain and shifting, and a few more guys further down the road. We came back into Moravia and parted ways at the market. I'm looking forward to next Sunday, and hoping the sun will come out to play with us again!
Sarah F. and I headed up to Geneva to go for a ride. I'd found a map online for an "easy" ride for us. It was taken from "20 Bicycle Tours in the Finger Lakes" by Mark Roth and Sally Walters, and the url is located here: http://www.interlakes.com/flp/flptourbike/flptourbike04.html Well, the terrain itself was fairly easy, but the map was really horrible!!! I hope the map in the book is better than this one, because if it's not I certainly wouldn't waste my money on it. We never did find the starting point for the ride. We rode around Geneva trying to find South Main Street. We couldn't find it. So we stopped in at a Subway fast food shop, showed the guy behind the counter the map, and said, "Can you tell us how to get to ANY of these streets??" So he directed us towards the nearest one, and finally, almost an hour later, we were on our way. We decided to take a slightly different, shorter route than was on the map because we got off to such a late start. So that was fine.... we went down County Rt. 4 instead of going up to Phelps as the map directs. The road had a decent shoulder, and traffic was fairly light. Then we turned left onto Seneca Castle road, which is one of the roads on the "official" ride. That was a quiet little road with lots of farms. This road and the next one both had no shoulders, but they were fairly straight roads (no blind corners) and very lightly traveled by cars. Next we were supposed to turn down Ferguson Rd. Well..... they'd recently dumped a blanket of gravel about 5" thick on that road, so that wasn't happening. So we continued on down Seneca Castle road until we hit Rt. 5&20. How the heck we ended up there, I'll never know. Last I knew, we were heading due west, which meant we never should've hit it.  Oh well. We turned left on 5&20, because it looked like the next road we wanted to take, Old Mill Rd., was down further, and it was! Woohoo! So then we turned down that road, where my bike was practically engulfed by a pot hole the size of the Barringer Crater. You have to be really careful when riding in the shade of trees because it's very good at disguising pot holes, I learned. Luckily I was able to ride right through it, though, with a very surprised choice explicative, while Sarah almost fell over laughing at me. Payback for me laughing at her when she was learning the clipless pedals last week, I guess. :) So we continued down this road, keeping an eye out for Charleton Rd, which we were supposed to turn on next. Guess what? Never saw it! We eventually ended up on Rt 425. Like Co. Rt. 4, that had a nice wide shoulder and wasn't too busy with traffic. We couldn't find that Lake to Lake Rd. that's shown towards the bottom of the map, so we just stayed on 425, hoping to see Hastings Rd, which of course we never found, until we got back into Geneva. We had to ride maybe a mile of 5&20 through Geneva, and that was hairy. Tons of traffic and no shoulder whatsover.  But the drivers were *really* nice and moved into the other lane to pass us whenever they could. No one honked at us or tried to mow us over, so that was good. All in all, we ended up riding 27 miles, so 10 miles shorter than the original route. So despite getting lost and having no clue where we were going half the time, it was a really nice ride! If we had more concise directions it would've been excellent. As I said, hopefully the book that this map came from has a cue sheet or something to go along with the map!
"What do you wanna do?" "I don't know, what do you wanna do?" heh. We thought meandering over to upper Robert Treman park would be the thing to do, so we headed up (and up and up) Hayt's Rd. I put my new road bike to the test; those granny gears work really well. I'm quite impressed with the bike. It's much lighter and faster, though a lot more squirrely than my hybrid is. I suspect as I get used to it that will go away, though. In the meantime, don't ride right next to me. :)  We turned left onto Sheffield Rd. and continued until Bostwick. We flew down into a little dip, climbed the hill on the other side, and turned left onto Van Dorn Rd. That was a really pretty little road, and the views of the hills surrounding us were beautiful. We reached 327 and headed down into Robert Treman. It was very quiet last night. There were very few people there besides us. Despite the heat of the past week, the rains (downpours?) from last week have the creeks running high and fast. This is my favorite state park out of any of them in the area. I went to check out the waterfall behind the old mill, which was running fiercely. We all loitered around for a about ten minutes, deciding where we would go next. We eventually continued on 327 back into Enfield, crossed rt 79 and headed back towards the "usual" Thursday night stomping grounds. We rode up Halseyville Rd, and the view down into the valley on the left was really cool. The humidity and haze made it look as though there was a light fog cloaking the valley. Brendan parted ways with us at Iradell Rd., as he lives on a road somewhere off that, and next Charles and I turned right onto Swamp College Rd, leaving John and Mark(?) who continued on to Trumansburg. I was feeling pretty spent by that point due to a too vigorous workout the day before, so I didn't think I had it in me to go the extra miles. The roads were so quiet up there last night. I think the heat was keeping everyone inside, though Charles and I both noted how we weren't getting too overheated, since we were creating a pretty good wind on our own. The lack of a headwind last night was REALLY NICE!!!! I think it's the first time I've been out since I started riding 2 months ago that I haven't had to fight the wind. What a welcome change, along with warm, dry weather. Okay, HOT weather, and only dry in the sense that it wasn't raining, but I'm not complaining!!! We ended up back at our cars, where I mentally congratulated myself for completing my second ride using clipless pedals without falling over and making a fool out of myself. Yay!!! LOL, you watch, now I'm going to fall next time I'm out, just for writing that. I'm going to give my body some time to recover, and then I'll be raring to go for the Sunday ride. The weather looks favorable so far.....
So I slowed down into a comfortable pace, and began to enjoy the scenery. But not too much.... as I knew that road bike's tires would not be quite as forgiving as my hybrid's tires if I happened to run over broken glass because I wasn't paying attention.   Ann S. was waiting for me just across rt 79. She'd noticed that I'd been dropped.  Then she told me not to worry about dropping her, since she was really slow and was fully equipped for emergencies. LOL, another girlscout like me! We rode within eyeshot of each other for a while. We rode down White church road together, which has some really cool views of the valley that is between that and Coddington Rd. I had two interesting dog experiences, the first of which was along this road. I heard a vehicle coming up behind me, and just continued on as normal. It started to pass me, and a huge canine let out this deep, bellowing "WOOF!!" which just about gave me a heart attack! LOL, I mean, you just don't expect cars to bark at you! So Anne and I traveled together down 96B to just outside of Candor, where we took Gridleyville Crossing road over to rt. 96 instead of going into the small town to stop at the convenience store. We stopped for a snack and a stretch right before we turned from Gridleyville onto 96.    I continued down 96 and turned left onto Straits corners rd., and started up a long, gradual incline. Most of the other riders must have went on into Candor and stopped at the convenience store, because as I neared to top of the hill, a bunch of them started to pass me... again.  :)   We were almost at the top when I saw a large-ish dog standing in the middle of the road. But since a bunch other cyclists had just passed the dog without incident, at least as far as I could tell, I just kept going. As I neared it, I called out "Hi puppy!" to the dog. He was a cute dog.   Uh oh, here comes cute dog right at me. Uh oh, is that cute dog growling at me? Yep, definitely growling, with some snarling in there. SLIME! SLIME! Dog's wet nose is on my calf!!  AAAAHHH!!! Okay, what did my _Cycling for Dummies_ book say about dog encounters? Go as fast as you can? Not happening, since I'm still going up a hill, ummmm...... oh yeah! I deepened my voice and yelled out a stern "NO!" and cute-turned-territorial doggie went back into his yard. Phew. Compared to that, the rest of the ride was pretty much without incident.  Well, except for falling a couple times. I caught up with about 4 other riders where Halsey Valley rd. intersected with 96. We went up Crumtown rd, which has 4 pretty good hills on it. Going up the first hill, my chain gone caught when I tried to downshift, and splat, went Brenda on the pavement. Not too much of a problem. My seat got knocked out of whack, so it took me a few minutes to fix that. Started going again, and I was spent. Just totally bonked. Man it was hot today, and the sun was pretty intense on top of it. I started up the third big hill, and about halfway up I knew I couldn't do it. So I tried to get off, but somehow managed to get tangled up with the clips and splatted a second time. This time I landed in gravel, so I did quite a bit of damage. I'm sitting there on the side of the road, debating on whether or not to go to my mother's house, which was about a mile away off on Peter Rd., or whether to tough it out and keep going. I looked down at my knee and I had blood running down my leg. Didn't even care. Yeah, whatever. LOL! I had some bandages in my bag, but my skin was so sweaty and dirty I knew they wouldn't even stick. Oh, what's that? I just sucked the last of my water out of my Camelbak. ARGH! So, I walked the rest of the way up the hill, and decided to just keep going. I was so tired by this point, when I came to the last hill, I didn't even bother trying to ride up it. I just got off my bike and walked it up. Another girl passed me, and at the top she pulled over, apparently having trouble with *her* chain. I came up to her and we talked for a couple minutes, and she was out of water too. She was afraid of passing out, and I said, yeah, I'm pretty dehydrated, too. We were right next to a house with a bunch of people out front, so we decided to ask them if they'd mind letting us refill out water bottles. They were happy to help us out, let us use their bathroom, and a woman gave me a washcloth to clean my scrapes out. They were so nice. :) We got down to 96B, and I just couldn't bear the thought of having to climb any more hills to get back to East Hill Plaza, so I told the girl I was just going to keep going down 96B into town and home. I figured Icould get my husband to take me to get my car later. So I did that. By the time I got to the intersection of Aurora St. and State St., my whole body was shaking. But I was soooooooo happy to be home! WOOHOO!!!! I was pretty happy when I saw that I'd shaved off a half hour from the 60 mile ride I did a month ago! I finished it in 5 hours, including stops, whereas the Tioga county ride took me 5.5 hours, maybe a bit longer. So I was pretty psyched by that. PLUS, the Tioga county route was flat, and this one had tons of hills on it. So I think I did really well. :) Anyway, I got home and passed out on the couch for about half an hour, but other than that, I feel pretty good! The wonders of ibuprofen....
As per the norm, we headed off north, this time going up into Trumansburg and turning left once we entered town. We headed out a couple side roads until we ended up on route 227, and followed that out a ways. Nice, peaceful, quiet... and just like last week's right, there was a thick haze from the heat and humidity hanging in the air, giving everything a foggy appearance. I find it quite beautiful, myself. We went through lots of rolling farmland, went through Perry City, and finally headed back to the meeting point via Iradell Rd. Andrejs, Charles and I started up a gradual, long incline, chatting away. "God, Andrejs, doesn't this hill EVER end?" I demanded about a mile into it. Charles responded cheerfully, "Oh, it ends, and we coast downhill for a while, and then we go up another!" I just shook my head and groaned, wondering why am I doing this again? Oh yes, there it is, as we crest the top of the hill and the world: it's that breathtaking panoramic view we indulge upon once we finally pedalled up that last huge wall of hill, panting and gasping for air, yet feeling as though our entire bodies have been purged of all toxins. And the wonderful rush of excitement as "WOOHOO, I did it!" rages through my mind once again.    As we neared our end point, we rode past a huge meadow where four or five deer were grazing. They saw us coming, and decided that racing us from afar seemed like a fun idea. They all began running through the meadow parallel to us, white tails flipped up, gracefully bounding through the tall grasses. What a perfect end to a perfect ride..... 
Off we went! After settling into our own individual paces, I started out riding with Anne Shapiro, and two other people I'd met earlier that morning, another Anne, and Owen, for about the first quarter of the ride. I really enjoyed East River Rd. It had a beautiful view of a deep valley off in the distance, all green and lush looking. We almost missed a couple of turns, but luckily I had burned the names of some of the roads into my memory, so when I saw the road signs, a little voice would say, "Hey! I think I'm supposed to turn!!" Going down Taylor Valley Rd., we caught up to Alex, Jack, Andrejs and Charles. The Flat Tire Demon had decided to pay Alex a visit, so they were helping him out with that. I stopped briefly, but figured that they were stronger riders than I, so I went on ahead with Owen and Anne, figuring they'd catch up. Charles and Andrejs also decided the same thing. From that point on, I rode with Andrejs and Charles for a good bit of the ride.  This part of the route involved a lot of gently rolling hills. There wasn't anything too strenuous, and I was feeling quite hopeful for the remainder of the ride. At the end of Taylor Valley, turning onto rt. 26, we all stopped for a short break. Apparently my body decided I wasn't torturing it enough on this ride, so as I came to a stop, I unclipped my right foot, but somehow ended up leaning over to my left and landed on the pavement.  UGH NOT AGAIN!!!! Ya know? One of these days, I WILL get the hang of this! So I had to fight with my bike a bit to get my left foot unclipped so I could get up. I got up and surveyed the damage, which wasn't too bad. Just a small cut across my ankle from the derailleur, right next to the lovely gash that I received from a fall a couple weeks ago. Okay, so back on the horse, or something like that. By that time, Jack and Alex had caught up to us. We started up route 26 and fell into a haphazard paceline. I've never really ridden in a paceline, so Andrejs yelled at me to notice the reduction in wind around my head, and I definitely noticed it. He said it would work wonderfully until we hit the hill coming up, because he'd never been in a paceline that could overcome gravity *grin*. We started up the hill, and I came out at the top feeling pretty strong, thinking, "Oh, well if *that's* as bad as it gets, them I'm all set." Little did I know the pain that lay ahead.... We came down the other side and I saw Alex pull off to the side. Apparently he's such good company that the flat tire demon decided to pay him yet another visit. I stopped for a few minutes, but realized that he, Jack, and Charles were all much stronger riders than I, and that if I didn't get started again I'd get left behind. So I started off and met up with a guy in a maroon shirt I hadn't previously seen, Andrejs, Owen, and the two Annes again in Willet. Charles showed up soon afterward, as Don and Alex had the flat tire just about changed. We began a steady ascent up rt. 221 at this point, where Andrejs foreboded that this was the beginning of the climbing. I really need to get a cyclometer with an altitude reader.... About halfway up the first hill, Alex and Don came charging past us. I did pretty well going up these hills. I reached what I  hought was the top, but looking ahead I realized it just flattened and then started going up again. So I made it to the top of that, still feeling good, when I noticed that it was just flattening before going up yet again! Grrrrr!! Andrejs passed me at this point, and I said to him, "I hope this is the last 'bump'!" He replied "I'm not going to say ANYthing!" Which I knew was just bad. Bad, bad, bad. I got to the "top" of that hill and saw that AGAIN it had flattened and was going up, although this one was not as steep as the last couple, so I panted out, "Oh, that wasn't so bad, " to Andrejs as we crested. He just kinda smiled, and soon I saw why. We flew down the other side of that hill, when I noticed the mother of all hills looming ahead, seeming to go straight up. As I reached the bottom of the hill, I thought to myself, "Oh, it can't be *that* bad! They always look bad when you're coming off another hill. It won't be so bad once I start up it." And then I reached it and looked up, and I was right... it wasn't so bad, IT WAS WORSE!  ARRRRGH!! So I shifted down into my lowest gear, but even so, amazingly I managed to pass a couple other people. Of course, by the time I reached the top of this hill, I was spent. Andrejs passed me towards the top where it flattened out, as I was trying to catch my breath. He stopped a bit further down the road, and so I stopped. I just kinda slid off the seat and planted my feet on the ground, my whole body shaking like crazy. Someday I will learn to pace myself. Probably after I pass out from overexhertion one of these days. I finally got my breathe back, and we started down the hill into Marathon. Andrejs warned me that it was a steep descent, but I didn't find it too bad. We stopped at a Mobile station and met up with the rest of the FLCC'ers. We stopped for about 15 minutes, where I loaded up on more Gatorade and ate another power bar. I think my stomach is finally beginning to tolerate Gatorade, as it didn't make me too nauseous this time.   Andrejs told the group that we (he and I) were planning on just taking rt 11 back to Cortland, shaving off 5 miles and more climbing from the ride. We picked up a couple people this way, Dana and David, the same David I'd met last Sunday. Although I didn't realize it at first, because he and Owen both had similar bright red jerseys on, and my confused brain thought that they were the same person until I saw them riding side by side. Huh, what? Duh. LOL!!! So it was a 10 mile ride up to Cortland, straight into an unrelenting headwind. I'd noticed it as a crosswind on the top of some of the hills when we were heading west to Marathon. A couple times I thought it was going to knock me right over, and I found just how strong it was trying to ride right into it. We had a small group: Owen, Anne, Guy in Maroon, David, Andrejs, Dana, and me. We pretty much tried to stay together and form a paceline into the wind. Finally we arrived back into Cortland around 1:15pm, finishing our 50 mile trip in about 4 hours, including stops. I am totally psyched that I was able to keep up with a group of strong riders. That feels like even more of an accomplishment than "just" riding 50 miles.
I turned onto 327 and then turned off onto Trumbulls Corners Rd, beginning a long steady ascent. This was truly a beautiful road, going through a thick, dark, green forest, with some nice streams going under and along side the road to provide distraction from the climb. As I neared the end of the climb and could see the end in sight, I consulted my heart rate monitor, which had me in the 180's. I recalled Andrejs telling me there were no "memorable" climbs on this ride. "Memorable!  This isn't memorable?" I thought to myself. "It'll be memorable when they find my 27 year old body in the ditch, dead from premature heart failure!!!" But alas, finally I reached the top of the hill and turned into a nice flat, finally catching up to a small group who was waiting around for us slow people a couple miles later. I am truly convinced that Andrejs was a shepherd in a former life. :) We continued on once we had everyone, and headed out on Protts Hill road, which also had some wonderful views of Connecticut Hill and the surrounding hills. True to Andrejs' word, there weren't really any memorable climbs in this ride. There was, however, a memorable *descent*, and it was at the end of Protts Hill. I started riding down it, saw that it literally turned into a sheer drop, pulled over and got off my bike. And began to walk it DOWNhill! Now THERE is a first.   I mentally thanked Gary Weidberg for recommending mountain biking shoes instead of road shoes as I gingerly made my way down this hill. It was REALLY slippery! Everyone was down the hill, and so we took off down 13, and back up Trumbull's corners rd, over to Sebring, and back out onto 13. Andrejs and I decided to burn a little rubber out on 13, and we tore our way down the highway until the next turn, onto CR 14 in Alpine Jct.   Just before we turned from CR 14 onto CR 15/Church St., there was yet another breathtaking view of the surrounding hills and green countryside.    We stopped at the convenience store in Odessa for about a half hour, and watched some of the goings-on of the locality. These little towns sure do have a lot of personality, that's for sure. Having gone to school in Spencer Van Etten, I'm pretty familiar with little towns like this. I'm sure they were just as intrigued by us as we were of them, heh. After our break, we remounted and embarked on our last 27 miles. The long break didn't do me any favors, and my legs felt like pure lead as we started. On top of it, the Winnie the Pooh song my son has been listening to constantly began replaying over and over again in my head at this point. I trailed behind the lead group for a while, but in doing so, I was treated to a really cool scene. When the group turned onto CR 6, the road that goes around Cayuta Lake, they were up on a ridge. It looked as though they were riding a tightrope, and only the sky was in the background. So it provided a really cool image, of these riders on their bikes, silhouetted against the blue backdrop. Really neat :)   (Oh yeah, the sky cleared up and it turned into a beautiful day about an hour after we started). CR 6 is another really beautiful road that goes through forest, and then farmland. We reached a "minor inconvenience" (hill) as Andrejs put it, and worked our way up that. We stopped at the top, and Charles said this was his favorite view of the entire ride. It was a really nice view, a grand vista of a valley with some houses and a farm, plus really pretty mustard plants along the side of the road, and some other blue flowers I don't know the name of... We came back through Mecklenberg and then Perry City, and decided to turn off of Perry City Rd. in favor of some other roads that would take us around the ridge rather than over it.   We crossed 96 and were in the homestretch. At this time, my bike decided the ride had just been far too mundane and it was time for some theatrics. As we went up this short, steep incline just before Gorge Rd., I didn't shift down far enough soon enough. I got toward the middle of the hill and tried to shift to the smallest gear, and the chain fell off! Ugh! Not having any momentum at all, without any time to even think of unclipping, I went down. So there I am, lying on the pavement, unable get my shoes unclipped, mentally screaming "AUGH! A CAR'S GONNA COME AND I'M GONNA DIE!!!"   I looked up and sure enough, there's a car coming to a stop behind me! Oh, HOW EMBARRASSING! I mean, bad enough when you fall in front of other cyclists who understand the whole concept of clipless pedals, but I can only imagine what was going through this couple's head as they saw me struggling to get away from my bike. So this woman came bolting out of the passenger side of the car crying, "ARE YOU OKAY??!!" as I'm floundering around like a fish out of water. FINALLY my right shoe unclipped and just like that, the left one came out, too. I got up, and assured her, "Really, I'm fine. This is just a normal day for me. See, look, I'm not even bleeding!" LOL!!!!! After getting the chain straightened out and spouting off a bit to no one in particular, I got back on the bike and continued on back to my car. I imagine that there has probably never been another person in the history of clipless pedals that's fallen as much as I have! "They" said, Oh yeah, after a couple of first timer falls, you'll be fine!! Yeah, right, whatever. You obviously don't know who you're dealing with, here!! ~wry grin~ Until I do some really serious damage to myself, I'm going to keep at these things. A few scrapes, bruises.... ahh, it's just like being a kid again! Anyway, another nice long ride, which all in all, was very beautiful. The weather was great. Another Sunday well spent, in my opinion! 
There was a time, and it wasn't that long ago, maybe a month or so.... when I thought riding 30 miles on a weeknight would be an act of total and utter insanity. I mean, that's a ride best left for weekends, when one has all the time in the world to finish, and one is not racing darkfall home. As I rode the Thurs. night easy ride last night, we reached T-burg and pondered about whether or not we would go 20 or 30 miles that night. I found myself mentally rooting for the 30 mile journey, and feeling like major disappointment would be experienced if we chose to do the 20 mile route. So... does that mean I'm insane now? Come now, what is 30 miles, anyway? It only took us a couple hours to complete, and yeah, it was getting fairly dark when by the time we reached our cars.... but insanity? No, I'm thinking *progress.*  Progress in my climbing skills--I'm able to go up hills in larger gears than I could just a month ago, progress in speed--my average speed has been steadily improving, progressing endurance--I'm not dog-tired after riding 30 miles anymore, progress in that I haven't fallen/crashed in over two weeks now!!! .... But not necessarily insanity. Except for the fact that I'm actually beginning to *like* hills. What? I didn't just write that, did I? Definitely nuts.... I've been climbing hills all week, which is why I strongly suggested we *not* take Iradell or Perry City Rd. last night, and took it upon myself to lead the group on a route around the ridge instead. Was it cheating? Yeah, probably, but there are plenty of hills around here to climb if you were really feeling deprived. :) Anyway, our ride last night was really wonderful. It was a bit muggy starting out, but by the time we were 5 or so miles away from the end, it was getting a bit chilly. We had a good group starting out, 8 people, and then picked up another rider on Dubois Rd, and from out of nowhere, Charles came charging through like a train gone wild on Gorge Rd. We went on a little jaunt through the side streets of T-burg, as we missed our turn onto 227 and had to backtrack a bit. We headed our Searsburg Rd. to Stillwell Rd., came back 227 towards Perry City, and stopped at the intersection to decide which way to go next. I was not in favor of Iradell at all, was on the fence about Perry City, but was much more incensed to use my powers of persuasion to convince people to go over Waterburg and a few other roads in order to avoid the ridge. It really wasn't that difficult to persuade people. :) We took a few roads here and there that Andrejs had shown me and a few others on the ride back from Odessa a few weeks ago, hoping I would remember all the turns.   And I did remember the turns, so at least I didn't lead an entire group of people astray. It's one thing when you get lost on your own, but a whole 'nother story when you've got a bunch of people following you. heh!      We made it back just as it was getting dark, what with the overcast skies and all. I guess it's time to invest in a tail light... does the spending $$ EVER STOP??!!! Rhetorical question, I know. We saw a herd of deer in one field, made some wild guesses at the types of plants growing in the fields. "What do you think that is over there?" "Umm....... crops?!" as Kerry responded. Had a run in with some sort of field mower/hayer/tractor/something or other the size of a small house. That was kinda interesting. No ornery dog encounters (the word must've traveled that I am fully prepared to deal with them now), but there was a little fuzzy black kitten standing along the side of the road that was really cute! I would've like to have stopped and taken it home, but the cat I already have probably wouldn't appreciate that much. All in all, another fun ride! 
My first picture was of an inquisitive, friendly horse that was curiously peering at us from behind a tree as a group of 6 of us stopped briefly to refuel. I never realized how many horse farms are in the area until I started biking! We continued down some rural roads west of Seneca lake, many of which provided some really great views of the lake.  Although not very blue because of the cloudy, hazy skies, it almost looked like glass, it was so calm. Sometime along the way, we realized that we weren't on a road that was on the cue sheet or the map.  Obviously we'd missed a turn or taken a turn that we weren't supposed to! But it was all good, since someone had a map of the area, and we were able to hook back up with the route on the cue sheet. We began seeing quite a few Amish people in horse drawn carriages and riding bikes as well. We went down Ridge Rd, where there was a huge hill we sped down; I topped out at 43mph and about scared myself to death. :) It was fun though.... roller coaster, anyone? There were a bunch of kids and some adults riding their bikes around here in a leisurely fashion, and they seemed quite surprised when we came blazing through. Of course, on the other side of the descent, there was a huge hill, like a wall. I tried using the momentum from going down the hill to get up the other side, but I downshifted a little too enthusiastically and dropped my chain and jammed it up. Lucky for me, I was able to get unclipped both feet safely on the ground before my body met pavement. The chain was jammed up pretty good, and it took me a good three or four minutes to get it all straightened out. Ack, then I had to take off in the middle of this monster hill! But I made it without another incident. Finally, we were getting close to Geneva and preparing for our rest stop. We stopped at the lakefront park for food for about a half hour before heading on our way. I think I could've laid down and taken a nap at that point.... it was a very tempting idea! We were a little over halfway through our ride and ready to finish though. We were in the middle of the hottest part of the day, and the heat was getting intense.  We headed up rt 96A and turned off onto East Lake road near the psychiatric center. This road took us down the eastern side of Seneca lake, but the views from this side weren't as grand as from the other side. Or, maybe at this point I was just getting too tired to enjoy the scenery. I swear, this road, although the cue sheet SAYS it was only 7.6 miles long, it seemed to take an *eternity* to ride, and the group was setting a pace that was just too much for me. My head felt like it was going to explode, and my stomach was complaining quite a bit as well. So I slowed down and decided, hey, if I get left behind, oh well.  I've got the cue sheet & map, I'm all set. But Carl slowed down and kept me company, which I truly appreciated. Toward the southern end of East Lake rd., it goes through Sampson state park. Since most of the road was blocked to car traffic, it was peaceful, and SHADY, which was a welcome relief. We regrouped at this point and 6 of us rode together. The roads were a bit rough, but this section of the ride was quite nice. After getting off this road, we took a few other county roads. Around mile 60 or so, it started raining. Lightly for a while, but then it came down fairly hard for a few minutes, and then it was over. It was actually kind of nice and cooling, and I actually wished it would rain a bit more. After the shower, it became muggy and oppressive, and again, my head began to throb. Soon my right leg began to join in on the chorus of complaints and threatened to start cramping up in various places, so Carl and I stopped for a few minutes. I downed a Gu gel, yech, that was pretty nasty! But it seemed to do the trick, as suddenly the world, which had been a bit fuzzy and faded, became brightly lit in technicolor!  Alright, 20 more miles, NO PROBLEM! But it was a bit of a problem. I had run out of all fluids, and my left hand was so numb I couldn't shift my gears anymore. ACK! I thought there was something wrong with my derailleur, but we stopped and Carl was able to shift it without any difficulty whatsoever. Now if that isn't embarrassing, I don't know what is. So, he shifted it into the big gear for me, and finally we found a convenience store where we could get more water/gatorade, and the last 10 miles were a piece of cake. We stopped at Hector Falls where I did the tourist thing and took more pics, and came down the hill of rt. 414 and made it back to the Wal-mart parking lot. Phew. 82.5 miles later, and here I am! Yay! I did it! 
When we got to the turn-off for Sheldrake, Carl decided to take the loop, and I decided to follow Charles and keep going straight up rt 89.  I rode maybe a half mile behind him for the next few miles, and we met up with some of the riders from the main group coming out of the loop down into Sheldrake back onto rt 89. There were really nice views of Cayuga Lake from rt 89, and the shoulder of the road was in good condition and quite wide, so it was good riding. I'm not as nervous about riding with traffic as when I first started back in May, so the cars going by didn't bother me too much. At one point, I was following Charles, about 20 feet behind him, perhaps, and I noticed him swerve, and then saw why. There was a thick plastic lid from a cooler sitting in the middle of the shoulder. I missed it by millimeters, I think, while visions of hitting that thing and going flying at 20-some mph flicked through my head. Other than that, the ride as a whole was fairly uneventful. The pretty parts along this section were going through Varick and another little town, where 89 goes right along the shore of the lake. I could see people out on their docks fishing and swimming and just basically having a good time. I lost Charles again, and turned off 89 down the road which led up to Cayuga State Park at the northern tip of Cayuga Lake. This was a nice quite little road that went right along the lake again, with a view of the railroad bridges going across the tip of the lake.   I finally rolled into Cayuga State Park, and pretty much the rest of the group was there already. They'd been there about 20 minutes. We quickly took off again, after about a 10 minute rest for me. Charles, Chris, and a couple others decided to go up through Montezuma Refuge to get their extra miles in and make the ride a full century.  At first, I thought of going with them, since I was still feeling pretty good. After a couple miles, though, I realized I wasn't going to be able to keep up with them, and I really didn't want to hold them back.  So when they turned left at the intersection of rts 89 and 5&20, I headed right, going directly for rt 90. I was headed south, back home!  I was halfway through my ride! I was still feeling pretty good by this point, about 40 miles into the ride. I stopped for a moment in the middle of a hill, as I thought I saw some road markings indicating a turn. I was about to get my cue sheet out, when I heard this whoosh coming up behind me. I looked up and saw the main group of riders coming, passing, gone! "Oh, okay, I guess I AM heading in the right direction," I said to myself. So I remounted and took off.   A few more miles down the road, around mile 50 or so, I started to tire. The heat was beginning to bother me quite a bit. I began to feel like a 4 cylinder engine running on 3 cylinders, faltering and sputtering. I pulled over for a short break, and another rider pulled up next to me.  I asked him if he had any idea how far Union Springs was, but he wasn't sure. I never got his name, but learned that he was a grad student in engineering at Cornell. We rode together for a while, finally getting to Union Springs. Yay! Food!! So, we stopped for about 20 minutes and watched a few more smaller groups of riders pass by. We took off again, but unfortunately, the food didn't seem to refuel me very much. The grad student went on ahead, and by now I was feeling like I was running 2 cylinders! I turned off rt 90 onto Lake road just south of Aurora. This was another nice little road, right along the lake and shady, providing relief from the relentless sun. I came up upon Long Point State Park, and stopped there for water (maybe this should be called the NY State Park day-tour). However, they had big signs up on the mirrors stating that the water was only for washing, please do not drink. Oh MAN! That SUCKS! So, I hosed the dirt and grime and bugs off myself and headed back on the road. The road curved and turned into a fairly steep upward climb. I just looked at it and said to myself, "Yeah, I don't THINK so! And why can't this damn sun go behind a cloud?!!! Puh-LEAZE RAIN or SOMETHING!!!" I rode up it a bit, but when it got to the steepest incline, I got off my bike and walked it up the rest of the way. I crested the hill and saw a rider in a red jersey with a camelbak. "Hmmm....... that looks like Carl!" He had stopped underneath a tree for shade, so I caught up to him, and it was, indeed, Carl. After another short break, we started off again. Augh, by this point, I was just in agony. My feet were alternating between numb and hurting, and my saddle, well, I'm not getting back on my bike for a few days, let's put it that way. Luckily I'd remembered my gloves this time, so my hands weren't numb, and I wasn't having trouble shifting this time.  Carl and I decided that instead of remaining on rt 90 when it cornered by the Triangle restaurant, we were going to go straight. I'm sure this is where all my milage got cut down, as my ride only turned out to be 86 miles instead of 92, but at that point, I didn't care. I just wanted to finish the ride. We came up to the intersection of this road with rt 34B maybe 3 or 4 miles later and stopped. Soon, Charles and the two Chris's came through and stopped with us. Riding with a group of people provided me with some desparately needed motivation. We came down into Lansing, and I knew that big climb was ahead of us near the high school. I told them I was walking it, and Chris O. said, "Oh, you can do it. Just get into that lowest gear and spin!" And so I did. And so I made it up the hill. And from there, it was all downhill, as I had decided to take rt 34 down the hill back into town. None of that Cayuga Heights and extra miles junk for me. I just want to be home! I finally walked through my door and literally collapsed on the floor, sweating bucket, in my living room with a fan blowing down on me. My husband just shook his head and smiled at me.  "Fun ride, huh?" he asked. "Yeah, I guess so. I'm probably NOT going on the 100 mile ride next Sunday though." I responded, which resulted in another head shake on his part.
So, since I'd been off the bike for two weeks, I decided to take the 40 mile route option rather than the 65 mile route.  I met the group up in Dryden at the Post Office, and there was a fairly small group of people, maybe 15 riders.  The couple was back on their tandem bike again.  That thing is awesome looking.  A very nice cannondale, beautiful!  I stayed with the group for about 3 or 4 miles before falling behind.  I wasn't expecting to keep up with anyone, though, so that wasn't disappointing.  Having just begun a new job, I haven't had much time to myself lately, so I was looking forward to 40 people-free, conversation-free miles. As it was though, Charles as usual feels compelled to wait around for me and accompany me on these rides.  I don't mind, as he usually stays back just enough so I have him within eyesight, but then I feel bad because I don't think he's getting the ride that he would like to do.  Oh well.   The first half of the ride was fairly easy.  It was also mainly along state highways, so there was a wide, comfortable shoulder for most of the ride.  And although it was a state highway, there wasn't much traffic at all.  There was a long, gradual ascent up a hill just outside of Marathon, and then of course a nice downhill going into the little town.  I was actually speeding for the first time in my life on a bike.  That gave me some sort of cheap thrill, as I was going 35 in a 30 mph zone. heh.  We reached a little gas station/convenience store in Marathon and stopped for some something to eat & drink.  The wind was starting to pick up by this point, so we were all riding in a long paceline.  I was doing really well, keeping up with everyone, but we just kept going up and up and up and finally I couldn't take it anymore!!  I slowed down, but FINALLY we reached the top of the hill and started going down.  Yay, FINALLY!  At the bottom of the hill, we turned left and started up yet another steep incline.  This one did me in, and I lost everyone again.  Even Charles pulled way ahead of me and out of eyesight.   This stretch was 7 miles along route 215 into Virgil.  It seemed to me that it was taking FOR-EV-ER!!!  So I pulled over and consulted my cue sheet to make sure I was headed in the right direction and hadn't missed a turn.  Well, I looked at the wrong line on the cue sheet, thinking I was on a different road, which I was only supposed to follow for about a mile.  So I thought I'd missed a turn.  So, I turned around and pedalled a couple hundred feet, but wasn't really wanting to backtrack, so I thought hard about where the road I was on went, and remembered that it came out right in Dryden.  So, cool!  So I went to turn around AGAIN, and here came splat #1 on the pavement.  Right in front of a huge line of cars, no less.  I got up and had two nice cuts across my left knee, and some mild road rash up my left arm below my elbow. Oh well.   So I started back on my way, and got about a half mile down the road, when I see two other bikers coming from the opposite direction.  It looked like Charles and I couldn't tell who the other person was.  But right at that moment, a bee flew inside my helmet and was angrily buzzing where it was caught.  I completely freaked out and the only thing I could think to do was get that helmet off!  So, I don't even think I applied the brakes, I just crashed into the very grassy ditch, disentangled myself, and got that helmet off before I got stung!  So, that was pretty stupid, but effective, as the bee flew off on it's merry way and I was left unstung.  I saw Charles and Chris waiting on the other side of the road waiting for a break in traffic to cross the road, and saw the concern in their faces.  So I yelled that I was fine, which I was.  The grass provided a nice, soft landing, and thank goodness I was wearing gloves, or my left hand would be all torn up.  As it is, I just have some scrapes in my pinky.   Anyway, so it turned out that I was heading in the proper direction, and I stayed with them for the remainder of the ride.  About this time something deep inside my right knee began screaming bloody murder.  I don't know if I'd been pushing the previous hills in too big of a gear, or if I did something during one of my falls, but I was forced to take it easy for the last few miles.  As we got outside of Dryden, we separated, since I had to go back to my car, and they were heading back to Ithaca.  I meandered around the outskirts of Dryden for a while, not quite sure where I was going, stopped and asked for directions, and finally made it back to my car.  I was not exhausted, but my knee was aching pretty good.  It feels fine now, a couple days later, so I don't think I did anything horrendous to it.  I should be fine for tomorrow night's easy, slow club ride. 
As he was changing it, Andrejs checked my front tire and thought that felt a bit soft, too. Kerri asked me if I'd pumped them up before I left, and I said no. "Oh, well when was the last time you pumped them up?" I kinda looked at her with this confused expression and responded that I hadn't pumped them up since I got the bike! She looked like she was going to choke! Andrejs was like, "You've *never* pumped your tires up???" Ummm....... okay, at this point I know there's OBVIOUSLY something wrong with the fact that I'm not pumping my tires up on a regular basis. So lesson learned: I should pump air into my tires on a very regular basis. I've read a few books on bicycle maintanence, and for the life of me, I can't recall any of them mentioning this little tidbit. Sheesh, they must think I'm a complete moron! I always wondered why I saw this one woman pumping her tires up before she took off on EVERY sunday ride. I was thinking "damn, she must have some bad tires; why not replace them?" Oh well..... now I know! Anyway, we set off on our ride. We got about 23 miles in, averaged about 14.5mph, which was good. They decided to take Iradell Road on the way back, my absolute faaavorite (heavy on the sarcasm there). I was getting closer to The Mother of All Hills, and thinking, "oh, you know, this really doesn't look that bad anymore." I'm halfway up it, thinking, "MMmmm, okay, it is still pretty challenging." I'm almost at the top, thinking, "HOLY MOTHER OF GOD I'M GONNA DIE! What the hell was I thinking back there, 'this isn't so bad'-- MY ASS! *GASP**PANT**SPUTTER*" But the nice thing about Iradell is that you go up this hill that's about a half mile long, if that, and then you get this nice two or three mile descent on the other side of it. It is *well* worth the effort. We crossed 96 and looked back to see a gorgeous pink and orange sunset illuminating the western sky. It was a great ride. When we got back to the parking area, Andrejs suggested that next week we meet at Cass park and go up Bostwick Rd. I thought Charles was going to choke on his water. He looked at Andrejs with this expression that clearly said, "You've got to be kidding me." and said, "What?" And Andrejs had this expression on his face in response to Charles's that said "C'mon you pansy. I'm not proposing Mt. Everest here," and said, "Yeah, Bostwick. I think we should do that next week." And I'm thinking to myself, "I'm game, cuz I wanna know if I can do it. Do I have what it takes? I think I do. I need to prove it to myself." In the end, we decided to wait until later in the season, when the nights were short and we didn't have a lot of time to ride. Because Bostwick in only maybe two miles long, but it's two miles of about 8% grade the entire way up. It ought to be interesting. :)
Already the leaves were falling and lightly coated the black pavement.  After a couple miles of climbing, the road went into gentle rollers for the remaining 10 miles or so.  It went through thick, damp forests, and goldenrod blanketed the fields and hills that were scattered in between the forest.  It was very pretty, contrasting with the brilliant red of the Sumac trees interspersed throughout.  I can't wait until the leaves reach their peak to do some of these rides.  I love the colors of fall:  deep purples, bright reds, golden yellows.  Toward the end of the road, down towards the town of Chemung and 17C, the road got *really* rough.   Up 'til that point, I'd been riding with Andrejs, who was taking it easy after doing a bunch of hill climbing the day before.  Me, I have no excuse.  I'm just slow.  :)  Toward the end of Wyncoop, we picked up Charles, who was sitting along side the road.  He had lost the lead cyclists, was unsure of which direction he was supposed to go next. Discomfort aside, we turned east onto 17C and rode down through Chemung.  Shortly after leaving Chemung, we turned right onto this narrow road that eventually turned into a recreational pathway that ran along the Sesquahanna River for a mile or so.  That was absolutely gorgeous!   So that ended and spit us out on an overpass that went over rt 17 and back to 17C.  We headed through Waverly, and decided to cut the road a bit short and make it a little easier (ie. less hilly) and took rt. 34 north.   We hooked back up with the pre-determined route from there.  Route 34 was good; they'd just repaved a good portion of it, so it was nice and smooth.  A lot of traffic though, and I don't particulary enjoy inhaling car/truck exhaust.  We reached the end of Dean Creek rd, which was one of the roads that the map showed, and headed up (and up and up and up) that road.  It was a much more gradual climb than it would've been if we'd followed our original route.  By that time, it was 11:30 and the sun was getting pretty hot.     We got to the top of the hill, and took a break.  Pretty soon, the lead group of cyclists came huffing up the hill.  They were quite shocked to see us, and rightly so.  We made some jokes about blowing by them so fast that they hadn't even seen us.  I trapped Dan, who I hadn't seen in a couple months,  with conversation, and pretty much rode the remaining 5 or 6 miles with him.  The rest of the group plowed on ahead and had their bikes all loaded into their cars by the time Dan and I pulled in.  It was such a gorgeous day.  I really hope the 50 mile ride next weekend is as nice! 
The air was still fairly cool as I loaded my bike onto the rack on my car and started out on the 30 minute drive over to Watkins Glen.  Thankfully, the irritating Slow Driver whom I always seem to get stuck behind when I'm running late was nowhere in sight!  I pulled into the marina parking lot a few minutes before 11am, and saw several other people unloading bikes and putting on cycling gear.  There were the Big Horn Velo women, and a few other people who sometimes join the Velos, plus Andrejs and myself from the FLCC.  I put on my own accessories and soon afterward, we embarked on our 50 mile journey.   We started up the long, steep 1.5 mile climb out of Watkins Glen.  I felt like I did much better this time than when we came up this hill for the Seneca Lake ride last month.  Perhaps it's just because I was with a group that was going my speed, and I wasn't passed by 15 other people and left in the dust.  Andrejs, Amy, and I reached the top of the climb and waited about 5 minutes for the rest of the group.  We couldn't see them coming at all, so we decided to keep going.  We would stop in Dundee and wait for them to catch up at that point.  The beginning of this ride was familiar.  The first 3 or 4 roads we took were the same roads that we'd taken on the Seneca Lake ride. After about six miles, we began turning west, however, and departed from the northern-bound Seneca Lake route.   We went along some rolling hillsides for a couple miles before starting down a long, nearly 2 mile descent.  It was great fun going down, but as Amy commented, it was not going to be quite as much fun on the way back up it.  I decided not to think about it until the time came.  We turned onto another rural road, and then came to 14A, which led into Dundee.  We followed that for about 5 miles, and that again, was mostly downhill.  We reached a gas station in the center of the little town, and waited for the rest of the group to show up. We ended up waiting nearly half an hour.  We ate some food, drank some fluids.  Andrejs and I talked about riding the trail along the "Grand Canyon of the East" down in PA.  I've heard a lot about this place, and I'm quite curious about it.  We decided to maybe organize a ride next month for that.  Then we wondered who was doing the full century ride, and gee, where was Charles?  We would've thought he'd be riding today.  The other riders pulled in, and Andrejs, Amy, and I decided to head out again.  I was getting cold. The sun had ducked behind a cloud when we arrived, it seemed, and hadn't come back out.  We were just about to take off when who should arrive, but Charles!  He said he'd started out at the normal noon take-off time, and he was the only one there.  I was flabbergasted, for lack of a better word.  "Wait a minute.  You started out a full 45 minutes after we did, and 15 miles later you've already caught up to us?"   Andrejs and Amy quickly pointed out that we'd been sitting here for almost half an hour, so we really weren't that far ahead of him.     The four of us started out again, and my legs felt like leaden weights.  Augh, it had taken me 10 out of the 15 miles we'd just ridden to warm up, and now it was going to take me another 10 miles to warm up again.   We headed out 14A again and turned off onto Chubb Hollow.  We received a full taste of Amish life in central NY along this road.  We passed at least 3 horse drawn carriages and at least 4 groups of young Amish men riding bicycles going in the opposite direction.   We pedaled a few more miles, and began to turn back towards Watkins Glen.  We went along a short section of rt 414 past a vineyard, and the smell of grapes was absolutely divine.  We came off the highway and went to the opposite extreme, where we had to do a little rough riding into a gulley on a dirt road.  The section of dirt road was only about a quarter of a mile long, so that wasn't too bad.  All too soon, it seemed, we were back at the top of the hill coming out of Watkins Glen.  "Check your brakes!" Charles joked as we began the quick descent back into town.  We flew down the hill, dodging some nasty potholes in the road, and before we knew it, we were back at the marina.  Somehow, we'd only ended up with 43 miles on our odometers.  Amy was determined to reach 50 miles, so I rode down to Montour Falls with her, and then around a few blocks in town to get the full 50 miles in.  Around 3:45pm, we had our bikes packed up and we headed home.  I had decided not to hang around for two more hours and enjoy the steak dinner to follow, but even so, it was an enjoyable ride.
Anyway, so I frantically ran to a local sporting goods store to buy a long sleeve dri-fit t-shirt, warmer socks, and a fleece head band thingy to keep my ears warm before heading home to load my bike on the car.  Seriously, wasn't it just last week that I was at the Bike Rack telling Gary, "Those gloves are too warm.  That jacket's too heavy.  I don't need those yet."  Should've gotten them!  I got to the store, and the wind practically ripped the door off its hinges as I cracked it open.  "Ugh," I thought.  "Am I seriously thinking of going riding tonight?  Maybe the wind isn't as bad on the *other* side of the lake."  No, I'm not demented or anything.  So, I bought my goods in a hurry, nicely brushing off the sales clerk who was trying to flirt with me, and maniacally drove home.  As I flitted around the house pulling my long tights on, my new shirt, socks, etc., my husband came home.   I wondered at him if anyone else would show up for the ride, and he replied that there probably would be, since there were all kinds of crazy people out there.  Hmm... thanks Honey.   So I again, maniacally drove up to the meeting place, conveniently ignoring the temperature gauge as I passed the bank.  I was afraid if I actually saw how cold it was, I would turn around and go back home.  I got to the parking lot and sat in the car for a few minutes, prolonging my comfort in my heated car.  I had passed Andrejs hoofing it up the hill, so I knew at least he would be there.  In a couple minutes, another car pulled in, and a guy named Jason asked me if this was the meeting spot for the Easy Ride.  "Yup," I replied, and he parked his car.  We both started unloading our bikes and worried to each other about the lack of clothing we were wearing.  He at least had a thick pullover on under his windbreaker.  Soon Andrejs reached us, and then Charles arrived.  We set off pretty quickly soon thereafter.   It didn't take me too long to warm up.  We have to climb a hill shortly after starting out, so that warmed me up.  The going wasn't too bad.  The air was very crisp....  very.  But it was pleasant.  I really love fall.  There's nothing better than being outside during the fall.  The colors are awesome, and they are even more awesome when they're illuminated by the setting sun.    And the clouds in the sky made for a truly magnificent sight.  They were these HUGE, thunderhead-type clouds, but white with streaks of gray instead of all gray or black.  But they were really high and voluminous, and the sun was setting in the opposite hemisphere of the sky, which made these clouds all pink and orange with streaks of gray throughout.  Beautiful!  Gorgeous!    I think by this point, we'd gone about halfway or maybe 2/3 of the way through our ride.  The sun had set.  The air was getting even colder, and it was getting fairly dark.  I can't tell you how many deer we saw last night.  It seemed every road we turned onto, a group of 8+ deer would run across the road, scattering.  We saw them out in the fields, too.  They would see us and their little white flag tails would raise to alert the others as they bounded away.   Coming down Iradell Road and across 96, back to DuBois road was an interesting experience.  It was almost completely dark by that point.  But the skies were clearing up, and a few early stars were shining, and the half-moon illuminated the landscape fairly well.  My night-time vision is still fairly sharp, so I wasn't having too much trouble seeing, even though I don't have a head light (I've decided that's my next investment, along with thicker gloves and some sort of foot protection).  I think all four of us were pretty chilled to the bone, so we weren't talking.  We were concentrated on wandering down the darkened roads without running into any huge potholes and getting back to our cars.  I did look up long enough to watch the moon for a bit.  Okay, now I can understand the attraction of night riding.  It's very peaceful and solitary.  All I could hear was the sound of the bikes' tires rolling along the pavement.  I saw Andrejs up ahead, and noticed plumes of steam coming out of his mouth when he exhaled.  "Just how cold out here is it?" I wondered to myself.   We got back to our cars, hands and feet thoroughly frozen.  My legs weren't faring too much better, but still, I felt invigorated.  This isn't enough to deter me from riding; I just need warmer clothing!!  Anyway, looking back at yesterday's weather forecast, I see that the temp was about 40 degrees (F) when we started out, and about 35 degrees when we ended our ride.  Brrrrrrrrrrrr!!!!   Warmer clothes, definitely. 
So, we all met at 10am.  We actually didn't get started until about 10:20, as one of the ladies discovered a flat tire when she arrived.  Better to find it then than while riding!  Unfortunately for me, none of the people I normally ride with showed up, so I prepared for doing the 40 mile trip alone.  There's no way in hell I could keep up with the group that did show up.  Kind of a bummer, but it was such a beautiful day....  who cared?  I stayed with the group for about 3 miles before getting dropped on the rolling hills on Ellis Hollow Rd.  I had decided to bring my Canon EOS with me that day to get some nice shots.  I keep writing about all these rides, but never get any photos to go with them.  I felt confident enough that I wouldn't be falling over that I could finally take my camera with me.   This route is quite familiar to me, as it's a variation of the White Church-Coddington route that Sarah F. and I used to do on Tuesday nights.  I got to the top of the hill just before Ellis Hollow descends down to 79, and stopped to admire the view.  I took a couple photos before continuing on.   I got to the intersection of 79 and had to wait for a few minutes because there was a ton of traffic.  I shook my head in exasperation as some idiot turning onto the road I was waiting on decided to cut the corner short and turn into the oncoming lane rather than going AROUND me and turning into the correct lane.  What the hell is wrong with people?  It's like they see a bike and instantaneously transform into Idiot Driver.  That's just as bad as the morons who pull up beside me on the left to make a left hand turn, when *I'M* trying to make a left hand turn, and am signalling my intentions.  Um, DUH!  Gee, don't take a few extra seconds to wait now!!  Idiots!  Anyway, I traveled the short distance down 79 to the right hand turn onto Boiceyville rd, which connected to Valley rd.  I stopped here to consult with my cue sheet and chat with the horses who live on the farm at that intersection.  I reaffirmed my directions and continued west/south on Valley rd, and then took a left onto Old 76 Road.  This road was 2.5 miles of long, gradual incline.  I shifted down into my granny gear and just spun away at a slow, comfortable pace.  I like this road despite the climbing because of the cliffs on the left side, and the cool stream meandering along the right hand side of the road.  I stopped and took a couple photos of the stream.  It looked awesome with all the orange and yellow fallen leaves blanketing the stream bed.   I got back on the bike and kept going.  About a quarter of a mile later I saw two dogs standing in the road.  Ugh, I groaned to myself.  I braced myself for a few seconds of yelling at the dogs, but they seemed more interested in the car that had pulled into the driveway behind me than in me.  Phew.  Kept pedaling, pedaling, oh, I think this might be the top of the hill!  I thought to myself.  I reached the top and saw that it began climbing once again after a short flat distance.  Grrrr.  I *hate* these trick hills!  Finally I reached the turnoff onto South/Honeypot Rd, which was yet again, MORE CLIMBING!  Wheeee!   Spinning in my big gear, I reached to top of that ascent about a half mile later and FINALLY a downhill!  I cruised down the hill and saw my fellow FLCC'ers congregating in the valley.  Two bikes were laid down flat, strongly resembling horses that had to be shot due to broken legs.  I pulled up and two of the riders were fixing a flat tire on one of the "dead" bikes.  So I stopped and waited with the group until they got the tube changed.  We climbed up another short hill, and ahhhh, finally a reward!  A long descent down!  I cruised down the hill averaging between 34-38mph the entire way.  And of course, with the downhills, there must be the ups, once again.  I was already behind, as usual, but got completely dropped again on these climbs up yet more hills.  I didn't mind too much though, as I was seeing some awesome views and wanted to stop for more photos.  If I'd been with the group, I wouldn't have been so willing to stop and take pictures.  Since I was already dropped, who cares if I stop?  I got to the top of yet another long hill, that had some fairly steep parts to it.  Again, more breath taking views.  And yay, another long descent on the other side, all the way into Candor!  I got to the bottom of the hill, which spit me out on 96B and the convenience store, where the rest of the FLCC'ers were resting.   At this point, the group split into two factions:  those of us who were content with the original 40 mile route, and those that wanted to extend it into a 60+ mile route.  I was, of course, a member of the former.  :)  There were 7 of us, and even though I was really pushing myself, I managed to keep up with them for the second half of the ride home.  The downside to this was that I felt like I couldn't stop to take photos because I didn't want to hold them up, so I didn't get any more pictures for the ride.  The rest of the way back was fairly easy.  There weren't any long, gradual inclines, or even any steep inclines, aside from two stretches that were only about a quarter of a mile in length each.  There were just a lot of rolling hills.  When we were sailing down Brooktondale road, again, we broke into two more groups-a group that felt they needed to do more climbing and headed up Besemer and Snyder Hills, and myself and two other guys who felt we'd done enough climbing for the day.   I ended the ride feeling as though I'd just gotten my second wind!  I averaged 15mph, so that was pretty good for me.  I was thinking maybe I should've gone on that 60+ mile route.....   Oh well, there will be many more rides to come.  Not this season, but next....
