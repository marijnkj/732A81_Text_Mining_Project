1,"I anticipate curious looks from other cyclists I pass. In California,  the sight of a girl alone in old race clothes on a fully loaded touring bike would prompt a barrage of questions but here in Zuid-Holland where the bicycle commuters outnumber the automobile commuters, I don't even draw so much as a passing glance. I lose my self-satisfied feeling of bike-holiness as I pass a couple of Dutch mothers on bikes, pedaling along while reading newspapers and jouncing several babies on the front of their bikes. Dutch folks literally grow up on bikes, which makes it no small wonder that the Netherlands produces so many talented pro cyclists. I pass through pastures criss-crossed with canals, the cows staring at me through the mist rising in front of their placid faces. The morning is as softly beautiful as a watercolor, and I wish I'd gotten an even earlier start so I could enjoy it for longer. I zone out to the company of my portable CD player (which is blaring Mano Negra's first album) and breathe deeply, enjoying taking in an entire lungful's worth of air.  Seems like I've spent all winter in smoky living rooms, drinking diet coke and watching Dutch soap operas (I live with 25 members of the Dutch fraternity Minerva, a group who wants me to carry the message back to America they are the Dutch equivalent of Yale's Skull and Bones). I've planned out my route as best I could from a three-euro map showing all the bike paths in the Netherlands. First I'll go from Leiden to Zoetermeer, from Zoetermeer to Gouda, from Gouda to Leerdam, from Leerdam to 's-Hertsogenbosch, from there to Vught, from Vught to Eindhoven, and from Eindhoven to Maastricht. I figure if I go twice as slow as a train, or even three times as slow, I'll make it to Maastricht in nine hours with still plenty of daylight to sit at a terrace café. I decide not to stop and take photographs today because I plan to beat the clock and make it to Maastricht in 8 hours (six hours riding plus two hours of getting lost). The Netherlands is absolutely chock-full of road signs for cyclists, and I anticipate no real problems finding my way, with the help of the bike-path map. Three hours later, I realize that while the map may have all the bike paths on it, it doesn't have the names of the TOWNS the bike paths go through, or how to find them. I have stopped at least every twenty minutes to ask directions, and have doubled back twice after an hour of riding in the wrong direction. By 2pm, I still haven't made it to Eindhoven and I'm starting to think that I might not make it to Maastricht in one day. I slow down a little to enjoy the view, and decide not to take any pictures. Any photo I'd take will look like a cliché. I cruise peacefully along the top of a dyke for several hours, passing farmers stomping around in wooden clogs, thatched roof houses with gardens full of tulips, and happy cows. Imagine every quaint idea you've ever had of how the Netherlands looks, and you've got a good picture of this area of Brabant. After crossing several large rivers, or perhaps the same river three times (I'm not really paying attention, just enjoying the view as I roll my bike onto little ferries and chat with locals about where I'm headed), I still haven't found the next little town on my list. The hours pass by. I'm wondering why it's taking me so long, and thinking that I should be able to blame someone for this delay (maybe the people who sold me the map?) but unfortunately there's not really anyone else around here to blame. I'm in high spirits, though, because I can think many worse things than being 'lost' in a beautiful country and having the whole weekend to make it to my destination. 6pm. Finally made it to Eindhoven. I telephone my friend Marieke's mother, ready to call it a day. I think she hears the desperation in my voice because she tells me to find a nice patch of sunshine to sit in (it's still an absolutely gorgeous day, the nicest I've had so far since living in the Netherlands) and she'll come and find me. The bright yellow polo pulls up to my sitting spot by a canal as I'm writing in my journal,  'At the end of a ten hour day on the bike, even if it was flat and slow and gorgeous weather, everything seems a little overwhelming and the idea of going 100km to Maastricht tomorrow, let alone three weeks through French mountains by myself, does not seem very appealing. My back hurts, I'm grimy, and I really want my mom. But there are plenty of women who have toured France alone, for much longer than I, and I want to make myself tougher, both physically and mentally. I will regain my excitement after a shower and a rest.' and I draft off the car for the last 5km to their house. I am offered a Belgian beer the second I set foot in the door (I knew I rode bikes in Europe for a reason!), but I opt for a gallon of water and a shower first. I join my hosts downstairs in the garden as the sun goes down and we chat about my map (awful), the ride (wonderful), my pluck (they are impressed, but I still think I'm a wimp), and asparagus (they've gotten hold of the Netherland's very first asparagus of the year from a famous asparagus farmer and we're going to eat it for dinner). We have a delicious dinner of new asparagus with hardboiled egg crushed over the top, potato puree (a Dutch staple), and ham (another staple). After eating surprisingly little, I beg off dessert because my stomach has literally swollen to the size of a watermelon (I'm not joking! I'm six feet tall, so most of me is big, but I don't feel that watermelon is the proper size for my stomach, now or anytime). I excuse myself to go look in the mirror and instead of the freshly freckled face that I expect to see after a brisk day of cycling through the countryside, I see a whitish-green ghost with sunken cheeks. Hm. Maybe I should've drunk more water.
"
2,"I am SO SORE today, especially my rear, thanks to the cheap saddle I got for free from my shop. It was from the 'crappy saddle' bin, and anyone who's gotten a saddle from this bin, in any bike shop, can sympathize with the state of my posterior! After an on the bike, though, my muscle soreness dissipates and I enchanted with the still morning again today. I zigzag through absolutely deserted country roads, going in and out of forests, through sheep fields, and across the Belgian border. This forested area of North Belgium actually feels a little wild (a lovely change from the orderliness and perfect squares of the Netherlands). I am reminded, though, that nothing here is really wild when I round a corner and come across a Belgian with his car stuck in a deep sand bank. He's fine, laughing and smoking a cigarette, but I stop anyway to ask for directions (it's hard to believe that after 2 hours I am still pointed in the right direction). I am still pointed in the right direction and I realize the reason I like Belgium so much is because nobody looks at me askance when I speak Dutch to them. Maybe they can't tell I'm American because Flemish is an even funnier language than Dutch. I've been asked by many Flemish-speaking Belgians if I'm from Friesland, which I take as a compliment. The forest ends too soon and by the time I got to Weert my butt is hurting pretty bad. I stop at a bike shop and build up my European Peloton Wardrobe with a pair of Rabobank shorts. Trying to find my way through Weert, however, is not as fun as shopping for spandex. My plastic-encased directions-sheet has been in my hand for an hour because there's a turn literally every kilometer, and I lose my way. I decide that getting to Maastricht quickly is more important than a pretty route, so I set off to follow the highway. It has taken me three hours to get to Weert (which by auto is 23km from Eindhoven), and I'm feeling ready to cover some actual distance.  I follow the A2 highway out of Weert for 10km when the bike lane suddenly disappears into nowhere and I'm left with heavy industry and cars zooming by at high speeds, a big change after the peaceful forest. I decide to turn and find a parallel route (having definitely given up on my annoying hold-your-hand directions-sheet), when a saddle sore bursts, literally making me cry in pain. I head straight back to Weert with the intention of finding a train for the rest of the way. However, I find the original route before I find the train station and decide that butt pain or no butt pain, I've set out to RIDE across the Netherlands, not to take the train halfway when it starts to hurt. After a few bandages and a fresh coat of chamois cream my outlook is decidedly better and I set out again, resolute. I lose my way in Dutch Suburban Hell. New, square, architectural nightmares on the banks of too-still manmade lakes where the sun shines a little too brightly and the children stare a little too vacantly. On the shores of these lakes are deserted circus tents and snack bars, portable Fun Huts that seem ages older than the neighborhood (which I later finds out houses a nuclear power plant). I feel as though I'm inside the first chapter of a Steven King novel and am looking around like a caged animal when I spot a group of friendly Dutchmen out on a club ride. They point me in the proper direction (naturally, the opposite direction from the way I'd been riding) and I set off. Finally, I come across the last bike route to Maastricht on my map, a gravelly fire road along the river Maas. As I'm thinking, 'I hope my tires can take this, I hope my tires can take this,' both tires flat. I patch the holes and ask two farmer boys out walking their dogs for directions. By now I'm a little fed up with the curlicues and zigzags that the charming paths have been leading me for the last two days. The boys tell me I'm quite close to Maastricht, switching effortlessly back and forth between Dutch and German.  I follow their (much more direct) route, and decide that cycle touring in the Netherlands is great if you've got a hundred years to get from point A to point B. I, however, am ready to get to Maastricht. The friend I was visiting (fellow collegiate racer and Santa Cruz bike shop employee) has promised me piping-hot vegan lasagna upon my arrival, and after four months of meat and potatoes, I'm looking forward to tofu and nutrition chat. I am very much a California girl at heart. My way is literally uphill from here on, and I stop to take a few pictures because I'm so thrilled to have found a little elevation. I sprint up them in my big ring just to make my muscles sing. Maastricht by 7, and had a nice dinner, bed early because we're getting up to make it to the start of the race tomorrow.
"
3,"My quads are sore for the first time since cyclo-cross season! This means the mini bike tour was an absolute success, even if the race was a little disappointing (especially the end, which was a near repeat of last week's finish Rebellin sucking Boogerd's wheel and pulling around him in the last 100m to take the win). Will go to roadie shop tomorrow for better saddle and ugly Euro-trash shorts.

My jaw is getting tired. We had a happy reunion with Karin at the campsite and all slept like rocks. (Karin and I were dosed up on Thera Flu)."

29,"Graham and I had been planning rides together for some time but circumstances never quite panned out.  When Graham emailed me suggesting this ride- instantly- yes! In retrospect we were  probably overambitious in our distances planned for summer but no problems- weather was great with cloud most of the time and spots of rain for airconditioning!! My family took me to Killarney late Saturday afternoon to meet up with Graham- first stop on the  way into the mountains was Browns Falls where his extended family was frolicking at the foot of  the falls.     Saturday night was spent at the old Falls school which has been made into a  campsite just past Queen Mary Falls- bbq, campfire and great fellowship. The visitors book was  a wonderful collection of prose, poetry, and art. This was my contribution- if I can read my rough draft in my log!! ""Twas in a wet and rainy January Early in 2004 Two intrepid cyclists Graham and Dave Passed through these wondrous doors. Fresh and eager Experience meagre Keen as mustard Riding till they busted. Queen Mary to Warwick Then to Gatton Will they make Ipswich  For that banner of satin? Packet fish and cheap pasta Bike pants make 'em go faster Trail mix and tools Organisation Rules! Family supporters too Shared these wondrous quarters Camp fires and waterfalls  Such pleasures never pall. So under leaden skies All there ready for sunrise Final preparations are made And fond farewells are traded. So if about this ride u wish for more Read the stories...see the pics...be informed Type http://www.crazyguyonabike.com/doc/QMFallsIpswich on your 'puter Read our journal- cyber scooter!! So panniers on bikes Pull on the Nikes Adrenalin's flowin' Hey we're going' !!!   "
30,"  Despite an early rise we didnt get away until 7.30 pm- as I always i'm sluggish! Low cloud and spotting rain seemed to add to the mystique of the mountains as we revelled in the scenery and the tinkling of the bell birds. We had to bypass Queen Mary Falls to save time but here is a pic- great spot.     Our first stop was a quick detour to the viewing platform for Daggs Falls.    Then we started the descent out of the mountains. Wonderful feeling sweeping  around the curves at up to 50 odd ks/hr all the time with one eye looking out the widening  valley to the farms in the distance.      Killarney has wonderful old buildings and the infant Condamine River passes by the town on its way to the sea in South Australia. The butter factory which gave the town so much employment closed  in 1974 but the Co-Op which sold the dairy farmers supplies is still flourishing. Graham visited his grandparents in Killarney regularly as a youngster and before that his mother travelled to Warwick daily on the railmotor for  High School- no mean feat for a young lady in those days.    Graham located the embankment of the old railway which closed in 1964 and we followed it as much as possible to Tannymorel. On the edge of town was a well kept old church complete with small bell tower- opened ready for Sunday service. Seemed to be congregation of one when we took this pic- seconds after clicking the shutter an immaculately dressed old gent popped his head out of the porch and stared disbelievingly at the scruffy cyclists in his churchyard.     All that is left of the railway yard is the bagged grain shed; and another shed we suspect may have been a goods shed. A spur line ran four kilometres from here to the Mt Colliery  coalmine. In its time i guess this would have been quite a busy railway yard.    By the time we reached Emuvale I was desperately needing a pit stop- and nary a public loo  in sight. I was impressed watching an old stockman tending a small mob of cattle feeding in the ""long paddock""- by the time I had finished searching for loos he had retired to the shade of some trees and dismounted. Bother. Moral of the story- seize the photographic moment- to hell with the discomfort!!      Yangan was a welcome sight- public toilets!! It was also a photographer's paradise. Wonderful  late 19th century buildings- Masonic Lodge set high above a long flight of steps (""Lodge of the  Long Steps""); the School of Arts; store and others. Later I saw photos of this main street in earlier times full of angle parked horse drawn wagons loaded high with bagged grain waiting to unload at the railway.      The park is built on the site on the old railway station, and near the store a massive bagged grain storage shed testifies again to the importance of grain growing in years gone by. In front of the store a rocking chair provided welcome relief for two cyclists. After a welcome lunch break in the park we set sail for for historic Swan Creek just off the  main road. A school, former old inn, former church and cemetery all spoke of a flourishing community in the 1880's.     It was interesting to note that that the headstones were leaning at all angles from the large soil movements of the black soil.   Shortly after Swan Creek we reached the former siding of The  Hermitage. An agricultural research station was established here in the 1890's to assist the inexperienced new settlers flooding to the area. Graham and I thoroughly enjoyed perusing a wonderful display of historical photos and  audio-visuals in a roadside pavilion at the front of the research station.     Along this stretch  of the route we noticed the old railway embankment ran parallel to the road. We arrived in Warwick quite quickly- I hadn't realised how close The Hermitage was to Warwick.   After a quick cup of coffee and unloading our panniers at Graham's brothers place  we headed for the historic railway station. In one corner of the railway yards we were delighted to find the Southern Downs Steam ??? had an impressive display of railway memorabilia and workshop areas where a C17 loco and tender and timber carriages were being restored. From here we made our way across town to Lachlan and Pattie- our second sons second parents where he boarded in 1994 while completing a prevoc course  at the TAFE. Time was starting to beat us and we bolted back to Barry's place- well bolted  as  quickly as we could over 12 ks! After a very perfunctory shower we donned our spray jackets  and headed out in the drizzle again for church- made it in time for the sermon!! It was really a packed afternoon bit a good one!!     "
31,"       Allora is a historic town sitting beside the highway and like so many in its early days relied heavily on dairying.         From here we headed for Clifton- the interesting part was knowing where to find the shortcut to take us to the highway because Clifton is well off the highway.     After a couple of bum steers we finally found ourselves at the Spring Creek Caravan Park where we topped up our water bottles and were very kindly given cold drinks. From here it was a few kilomtres along the highway until we reached the Gatton  turn down the Maa Maa Creek Rd.  Here the countryside really opened out to undulating farmland with longggggg hills- sometimes kilometres in low gear hauling up the far side. Pilton Hall we stopped for lunch and water- and  promptly fell asleep on the pavers!! We woke up with a start at 3pm and still many more kilometres to ride.    Below- Graham actually facing the wrong way- the descent is to the left!!    I was starting to develop an allergic reactions to hills- when suddenly we found ourselves on the edge of the Great Dividing Range- and down we went. Not sure of the exact distance covered in this last stretch but we would wind around bends for a while, and then down a gentle straight for a while, and then repeat the process. Perhaps 30 kilometres of beautiful scenery  and riding in the evening as we wended our way out the valley towards Gatton. Early in the ride down we saw the Heifer Creek rest area set deep in the scrub- very inviting but it would  still leave too much distance for the next day. Also didn't seem to be any water- crucial  when you are carrying very few litres.    Below- Not traffic lights- cattle lights!! When cattle crossed the road at the the dairy up ahead this and another set of lights around this blind corner could be activated to warn motorists.     Below- a typical country hall- this one in immaculate condition- event the windows gleamed. Note the ""no camping"" sign- we thought it would have been a great camping spot!!     We finally reached Maa Maa Creek store at 6pm- yes still open!! and we wasted no time in cracking open a huge Coke each and scoffing an icecream. We had planned to camp in a rest area but I couldn't really see anything suitable (Graham did hear of someone else later who did find a rest area to camp in!) We finally rode a few more kilometres to the Tent Hill Caravan Park.  7pm- 100.11 ks by time we reached out tent site- my first metric century- riding time of 6 hrs 8 mins and an average speed of 16.2 kms/hr. The tent area had no camp kitchen to speak of- just a picnic shelter shed- but it was adequate. Also found I'd left tent poles behind- duhhh- strung tent between a tree and the shelter shed. After that distance we certainly slept well!!   "
32,"   Graham remembered a road which followed the railway line to Forest Hill- literally- and it was a very pleasant ride.       From there we trekked  to Laidley and sampled an excellent cake shop in the main street. On the way out we spotted Das Neumann House- luckily it had just opened.     To reach Grandchester we had to crawl over a doozy mountain range- some call it the Grandchester Range others consider it the end of the Little Liverpool Range. Either way it seemed to go and on and up and up- and I pushed  a fair part of it. Just didnt have what it took to keep riding. The railway line passes under in a tunnel- I'm not surprised. The tunnel would have been a major engineering feat in its time.      Grandchester Railway Station is very historic- it was the terminus of the first railway from Ipswich in the 1860's. Again it was a shock to be on the platform of a busy railway line- and not a soul in sight. While we were there a patrol car set up with bogies so it could run on a railway line came in from the Toowoomba side and crossed with an empty double header coal train heading back to Acland or  Macalister. Grandchester is also interesting because a sawmill there still uses a stationary steam engine powered with steam from an old C17 railway loco.       Postscript May 6 2007- this wonderful old sawmill burnt to the ground last night. From the Courier Mail May 7 2007  ""A SMALL Queensland town is mourning the loss of its iconic sawmill - the last in Australia powered by a flat-belt steam engine. The heritage-listed mill, built in 1945, was destroyed by fire early yesterday morning. ""It's like losing one of my kids,"" said World War II veteran Roland Gillam, who built the mill in Grandchester, 76km west of Brisbane, and still worked there every day. ""I put my life in to that mill and I loved every nut and bolt in it. To see it end up like this, I tell you, it's hard."" His son, Jake, took over running the mill a few years ago. ""It's not real good,"" he said. ""I'm still very emotional."" The mill was listed by the National Trust but insurers had refused to cover it. Jake Gillam said he did not have the money to rebuild and, like his three employees, would have to look for another job. ""It's gone and it's going to be a loss to the whole town,"" he said. Long-serving mill employee Bradley Knack was one of many locals yesterday having trouble coming to terms with the loss of the mill. Also a volunteer firefighter, Mr Knack was one of the first at the scene of the fire. ""The place was one big blaze,"" he said. ""I just couldn't believe it."" Grandchester publican Paul Robinson said the town had lost a piece of its history. ""It was an icon and this is devastating for the local community,"" he said."" http://www.grandchestersawmill.com.au/index.htm      Rosewood was a welcome if late lunch stop and it was great to stop in the picnic area to cook  up a large pot of pasta. Three cheers for pasta mixes- cyclists salvation!! I sent an SMS from here to the family in Ipswich to tell them we were doing well . Walloon was soon reached and  I rang the family to tell them we would not need a pick up from the edge of town. The traffic  coming through Wulkuraka on the One Mile Side of Ipswich was quite moderate and it really did feel better to ride all the way in under our own steam. We crossed the main road at the One Mile traffic lights using the pedestrian crossing- I just  didnt want to negotiate that volume of traffic on a loaded touring bike. We arrived at the  in-law's at East Ipswich about 4pm- 260 ks approximately and 3 days after leaving Queen Mary Falls. A most enjoyable ride.
"
33,"In hindsight we possibly could have had problems with the planned distances if it had been full-on summer weather. As it was with cloud cover and even ocassional rain spots it was very pleasant riding. Graham planned the route and I loved it. One idea which had been mooted was Toowomba to Warwick via the roads along the railway line which would have taken us through towns like Nobby. Day 2 would have been Warwick to Queen Mary Falls (same as the day 1 we rode except in reverse) and day 3 Queen Mary over The Head (headwaters of the Condamine River)to Boonah. This time we crossed the Great Divide on the Maa Maa Creek Road further north. I have seen The Head from Carrs Lookout near Queen Mary Falls several times- it draws me like a magnet- and I am going to ride over it one day soon. Another possibility which interests Graham (and now has me intrigued too)- some maps show a track from Goomburra State Forest (next valley north of Cunninghams Gap) which I think runs down into the Townson-Mulgowie area. Whether it could be negotiated on a pushbike remains to be seen. Some research needed into a tantalising question. Accomodation worked out fine- first night we used an excellent small camp at Queen Mary Falls which was fully equipped- second night was at Graham's brothers place in Warwick- always handy when you have contacts- third night we used a caravan park but a bush camp somewhere would probably have been better. Access to water is often a problem bush camping because you carry so little on a bike. I was excited to have a riding companion to share the experience with- and Graham's brain works better than mine anyway!! So much of my riding is solo and only cyclists are lonely cyclists. Graham was a great riding companion- I think he is happy to ride with me again- most people find me very irritating after the first couple of hours- maybe that is why I have to ride on my own so much!! Roll on Darling Downs- we'll be back!!
"
34,"   While I was pregnant last summer I was anxious to get out and do an overnight backpacking trip or smaller scale cycle tour, but my loving husband was worried about me tripping and falling, or getting in an accident while pregnant.  He used to tell me that I was carrying precious cargo.  So, the summer came and went and we didn't do anything.    This year we moved house and we had a cruiser (crawling infant) on our hands.  Prior to having a baby, Scott and I always said that we wouldn't let it slow us down; we sounded confident when we stated that we would take our little one along with us and that we would continue to have great adventures, but the reality of the situation is that having an infant has slowed us down.  Even just thinking about getting organized to go would make us tired as we listed off all the extra items that we would have to pack.  All of a sudden traveling in the mini-van sounded much easier.    Nonetheless, my desire to got out and do something with my summer was burning.  My motivation was enhanced by the fact that I am going back to university in September and will be attending school for the next 2 years, going straight through the summer term.  I felt that if we didn't do it this summer, it would be a couple of years before we got out again.  In addition, all of those brave and naive proclamations that having a child wouldn't slow us down were ringing loud in my ears and I figured that the longer we waited to get out there, the harder it would be to ever get motivated.  I realized that a cycle tour would be easier than backpacking as we wouldn't have to carry dirty diapers around with us and we could tow our daughter in a trailer rather than carry her on our backs in place of a second backpack, so we bought a secondhand trailer and then took a few test rides around town.   Any immediate adventures were put on hold by a move to Edmonton, Alberta from Vancouver.  As we proceeded to get settled into our new home, the summer seemed to be slipping away from us and if we weren't careful, September would arrive and we would have been adventure-less for another summer.  We thought about possible trip destinations and decided that the renowned Banff - Jasper Icefields Parkway would be suitable for our maiden family cycle tour.  Initially we wanted to make the tour into a loop trip, leaving from home, heading south-west to Banff, up the parkway, and then east back to Edmonton from Jasper, but with our other obligations time became an issue and the logistics of touring through an unknown area with an infant eventually trimmed the trip down into a one way journey along the Parkway.   Even with the shorter trip in mind, there still seemed to be many obstacles to us getting moving.  My husband had a number of things that needed taking care of before September so he began to waiver on taking the trip at all.  Steadied in my determination to do something with our summer I informed Scott that while I would really like to do the trip as a family I had decided that I would do it with our daughter even if Scott couldn't join us.  Sure enough, my demonstrated determination was all that was really needed to get us moving and out on the road.   Ten days later, we were leaving Canmore (the town outside of Banff National Park boundary) embarking on our 5-day cycle adventure.   I have shared this part of my story with you for a number of reasons.  In addition to giving you a little background on us and our motivation for doing this particular trip, I want to address the issue excuses.  I have met too many people who talk about wanting to do things and then complaining that they don't happen for one reason or another.  Many of these people assert that they are frustrated by their partner's lack of motivation to ""do"" these things, and other people say that life's other things always seem to come up.  Well, I have recently dealt with both of these issues.  To those who are waiting for their partners, I say, ""Don't wait.""  Plan the trip by yourself; expect to go by yourself, and more often than not, you will be pleasantly surprised when you partner decides to join you.  To those who complain that life's commitments get in the way of living, I say, make the living a priority.  When we were preparing to do the 5-month Pacific Crest Trail backpacking trip, we often got asked how we found the time, money or whatever.  Our answer was always the same:  we made doing the trip a priority so not going out for dinner, or quitting the job, weren't big issues.  The only issue that concerned us was going on the trip.  Now, obviously, I am not suggesting that people quit their job to go on a week cycle tour, but hey, if your dream is important enough to you and you make it a priority, the other things in life no longer seem quite so important. So, that's it.  I will climb off my soapbox now and let you read on in our journal.
"
35,"We haven't started our cycling yet.  We're car camping tonight, west of Banff, in Yoho National Park.  But I'm getting ahead of myself. We left Edmonton at 8:30 AM.  We drove straight down to Calgary, stopping only for breakfast at Denny's and gasoline.  We took the main highway ""Calgary Trail"" and found ourselves in that large city after about 4 hours.  The weather has been rainy lately and true to form, we encountered showers on our way down.  It's supposed to clear up and be nice for the remainder of the week.  As we made our way through congested Calgary streets, we felt good about choosing Edmonton (University of Alberta) over Calgary (University of Calgary).  We only saw a small part of Calgary (and just happened to drive right by the University of Calgary) we thought it felt like a much bigger, congested and busier city than Edmonton.  Edmonton, with a million souls in the greater metropolitan area, has a nice, small-town feel.  We've liked it so far. Having made it through Calgary, we drove through Canmore and then into Banff, following the Trans-Canada Highway 1.  We weren't stopping in Banff, oddly enough, as our first objective was Golden, B.C. (We have to reinstate insurance on our BC-plated Honda Accord, which we're getting out of storage, in California, later this month.  It's a long story, so we'll save you the convoluted details.  Suffice it to say, we weren't excited about having to go to Golden BEFORE we could begin our Banff-Jasper cycling adventure, but we had to.)  We drove  through Banff National Park, past the namesake townsite and up past beautiful Lake Louise.  As we entered into Yoho National Park, around 2:30 PM, we felt like our driving day was never going to end.  Alex was in her car seat in the back, being her incredibly tolerant self, as usual, but even so, 6 hrs in the car seat was getting to be a bit much.  The one good thing about the car ride was that we saw two or three deer and, as we were driving through Yoho National Park, we saw a black bear off the side of the highway. Finally we arrived in Golden and located the insurance agent just after 3:00 PM.  Scott was able to take care of business and Alex was unbuckled from the confines of her car seat.  We spent a little bit of time in town, before we decided to hunt out a campsite.  We walked down the main drag, which is very tiny, stopping at a market to feed Alex a bottle. After the feed, Alex had a good laugh when Scott picked some dandelions and blew the seeds, sending tiny parachutes skyward.  She giggled and giggled as she watched them disperse.  Alex was having fun and her tummy was full, but now the day was getting on.  Rather than try to make the two hour drive back to Canmore, in Alberta, we decided to seek out something closer.  We walked to the Visitor's information center to inquire about nearby camping and were told about three.  One we had seen from the highway, on the drive into town, an R.V. Park (yuck), the second was a municipal campground right in town, on the banks of the river, but it was across from the train tracks (and the train run through the night - noisy), and the third site was 13 miles south of town - reportedly very quiet and secluded - so we decided to give it a try.   After a long winding drive, much of it on a dirt road, we were disappointed with what we saw.  The campground was poorly developed, unlevel, rocky and it lacked any picturesque qualities.  It looked like it had been hacked out of someone's back yard, because the main building in front was a private residence.  Rather than stay there for $15, we figured we'd head back toward Banff, which would put us closer to our starting point for the morning and stop at a campground in Yoho National Park. After a 15 mile drive back to Yoho National Park, we soon passed by Hoodoos Campground.  We pulled in to see if there were any sites available, but the campground was closed for redevelopment and only the overflow spot (a dirt parking lot) was open.  Back out onto the road AGAIN, this time 20 or more miles further we came across Kicking Horse Campground.  We pulled in and there wasn't an attendant in the toll booth, but there was a note listing the sites that were still available as of 5:30 PM.  It also noted that there wasn't any running water in the campground, so the fees had been reduced.   We drove in and found an open grassy area with numerous sites around it. Normally, we would have opted for a more private, treed site, but as were are now traveling with a ""cruiser"" (crawling, but not yet walking, infant) we thought that the grassy area would suit her better.  Scott dropped Rachel and 'the Oop' off at our selected site, so Rachel could set up the tent and make camp, while he drove a kilometer down the road to get water at the sister campground (Monarch).  The water there came from a shallow, hand-pumped well.  There was a sign there, indicating it wasn't potable and had to be boiled.  Darn, we thought about taking some of our leftover PCT water purification chemicals (chlorine dioxide), but decided against it at the last minute.  Now we were going to have to boil water, a tedious process that consumes stove fuel, but with Alex, we figured that we'd better NOT take the chance of an intestinal problem. As we got the camp established, Alex had great fun crawling in and out of the tent and all around the grassy camp spot.  The campground had a playground area, replete with infant swings and (since the Oop LOVES to swing) Rachel took her over for a short swing, while Scott was fixing dinner and purifying water.  By 7:45 PM it was time for the last formula bottle of the day, a quick brush across FIVE new ""toofies"" and then off to ""bed"". We put her in the tent and Rachel laid with her for a while, but Alex wanted none of it.  Although she's used to an 8:00 PM bedtime, at home, and rarely goes down with a fuss, it was just too EXCITING around camp - this new environment!  Her curiosity was stronger than her desire to sleep and, perhaps, being cooped up in the carseat all day didn't help either. Rachel gave up trying to soothe her and left her in the zipped-up tent to tire herself out.  At first, she crawled all around the inside of the tent, looking for a way out.  When she couldn't fine one, she started to cry. We were thankful for the noise of the nearby river so that the other campers wouldn't have to listen to her crying, but even so, it was unnerving.  We let her cry herself out and after about 10 minutes, she fell asleep, with her thumb in her mouth.  Forty-five minutes later, she woke up and started to cry again. We are sitting at the picnic table, listening to her cry, while we try to enjoy the last 40 minutes of daylight.  We are both nervous and excited about our cycling adventure tomorrow.  We talked about what it will be like, cycling with Alex and how different it will be compared to our last cycling adventure - our 2002 trip from Vancouver to San Francisco and beyond.  As the light slowly faded, we watched the sun set on the mountain peaks above the campground and remarked that this will be the first night that we've slept in the tent since that cycle trip, nearly two years ago.  We spent over 6 months of nights in that tent in 2002: 5 months hiking the Pacific Crest Trail, from Mexico to Canada, and 1 month cycling from Vancouver to San Francisco.  Then, there was only two of us in the tent.  Now there's three!  (Well, two and a third, maybe). Hopefully, we won't smother the Oop!  We wonder if she snores?
"
36,"We climbed out of the tent and started packing up our gear as the other campers still hibernated around us.  We dismantled the tent, threw it into the back of the van and opted to get breakfast further down the road.  All in all, we were on the road before 8am - a breaking of camp time that would even compare to our PCT days. We drove out to Canmore and pulled in at the Visitor's Information Center to ask about where we could park our car, where we could get a good breakfast, and how we could catch a bus from Banff to Canmore as one of us returned to pick up the car after we are finished with the ride.  With answers to all of our questions we were off again in search of that breakfast.  Perhaps it's fair to say that we didn't take the information attendant up on any of her advice.  We opted for a quicker breakfast at McDonalds (the breakfast of champions?) and decided to try and locate parking outside of town rather than at the Sobey's grocery store.  After breakfast we headed back out to the highway and returned to a small community, Harvey Heights, of motels just down the road.  We pulled in at one motel that rented cabins and Scott inquired at the desk about parking our car on their property.  The attendant was more than happy to help us out and showed us where we could leave the car.      Then began the task of unloading the car and finding a place for everything on our bikes.  Traveling with an infant adds to the amount of gear we needed to carry and so we weren't necessarily able to pack things in their usual places in our panniers.  While we are towing a trailer and in addition to carrying Alex it can also carry some gear, but nonetheless, having to haul diapers, bottles, formula, etc with us has made for an interesting pack job.  It took us over an hour, but at last we were ready to set off on our adventure.  Shirley, the resort attendant, snapped a photo of us, and then with a wave we were off down the road.  It was just before noon.     A couple of kilometers down the road we reached the Banff National Park gates.  Cars and RV's were all lined up at the toll booth to pay their park permit fees but we opted to take the lane on the far right, for permit holders, and cruise on by.  Rachel had done a fair bit of research on the park fees prior to our trip and she had been told by one employee to park our car in Canmore to avoid paying the daily fee for the car, and to enter the park via the permit holders lane thereby bypassing the toll booths.  This is what we did and nobody questioned us.  We rode right on by. Once in the park we had a 20-kilometer ride along the Trans Canada Highway to Banff town site.  As we had driven this route in both directions within the past 24 hours we were anticipating a pretty flat road.  Well, as always, we were surprised to encounter as many hills (gentle and rolling, but nonetheless hills) as we did.  These hills hadn't been noticeable when all that was required to get over them was a little more pressure on the gas pedal.  Nonetheless, the ride into town was relatively uneventful: the highway shoulder was wide, the traffic was respectful of our space and it didn't take us long. We took the first turnoff to Banff town site as we were debating staying in one of the Tunnel Mountain (town site) campgrounds.  We didn't know what was ahead of us, but with a word like Mountain in the name, we should have guessed.  The road worked itself up and around the backside of Tunnel Mountain and it felt like a hell of a climb with our out of condition muscles and our heavily laden bikes.  We pulled in at the campground and were horrified to find out that a tent site was going to cost us $22.  We pulled off to the side to ponder our options and as it was not quite 1pm we decided to head into town for a picnic lunch and then to push on to either Johnson Canyon Campground or Castle Mountain Campground on the Bow Valley Parkway. We rode through the busy, touristy, town and pulled into a small picnic area just before becoming reunited with the highway.  There we had a nice lunch of rolls, peanut butter, salami, cheese and bananas before reloading the Oop and our gear back into their places and then heading back out onto the highway.   Five kilometers down the road we pulled off the busy Trans Canada Highway and onto the Bow Valley Parkway. We immediately lost any remnants of a shoulder, but we didn't worry too much because traffic on the Parkway was so light that at times we could ride side by side for long stretches.      What we gained in riding conditions, we also gained in rolling hills.  If we thought that the highway had some rolls to it, the Parkway had more!  We also lost sight of the Bow River more often than not, but we made our way along a beautiful tree lined, peaceful road. We were beginning to tire as we were easing our out-of-shape bodies back into the rigors of cycle touring when we had a good-sized climb.  Scott, who was not only carrying four panniers, but also towing the trailer with the Oop and more gear, was really feeling it.  Each time the road would level off a bit we would come around another bend and realize that we weren't quite done with the hill yet.  To make matters worse, and Scott grumpier, his cyclo-computer started malfunctioning and eventually gave out.  At last we reached the top of the hill and were treated to a couple kilometer cruise downhill.  Not long after the descent we arrived at Johnson Canyon Campground.  We had been informed that it was the bigger, busier and more expensive of the two campgrounds in the area so we decided to push on another 3 miles to Castle Mountain Campground.  Those tree miles were into an increasingly strong headwind and we were worn out by the time we finally made it.     Castle Mountain Campground has a creek running through it.  As we pulled in at 4:30 the campground was largely empty and we had our pick of sites.  We selected on that was creek-side and Rachel started putting up the tent (with Alex's help) while Scott went to get some refreshments (beer) at the nearby Castle Mountain Junction Store. Dinner was one of our favorites, spaghetti, and then we retired to the tent for a sponge bath and to escape the mosquitoes as we listened to the campground fill up around us.  Tomorrow will be another day in the saddle and hopefully our bodies will have remembered what this is all about by then.
"
37,"Alex decided to let us sleep in a bit more today.  It wasn't until 7am that she stirred, and even then, she allowed us to wake up gracefully.  It was 8am before we decided that we really needed to get up and face the day.  As we emerged from the tent we were surprised to see that most of our neighbours weren't up yet either and we didn't feel quite so lazy anymore. We had a hot breakfast of oatmeal, accompanied by hot chocolate for Rachel and coffee for Scott.  We enjoyed the beverages as we slowly dismantled our camp.  Meanwhile, Alex was contentedly climbing around in her trailer keeping herself amused, but about 10 minutes before we were ready to depart she bumped her head on the trailer and began wailing.  We could tell that she was already wanting to go down for her morning nap, but we had no bed to put her in so we buckled her into her car seat (which is in the trailer) and then Scott wheeled the trailer around the camp for a minute or two.  That was enough to put a smile back on her face, quiet the cries and we were able to finish up with our packing. We pulled out of camp just before 10am and began our 15-mile ride into Lake Louise.  We had redistributed much of the food supplies and gear to try and lighten Scott's load as he was towing the trailer, but whether or not it made much of a difference to him we don't know, but Rachel sure felt like she was hauling a 100-pound sac of potatoes much of the morning.   The ride was more rolling hills (and they seemed to be much more up than down) along the tree lined parkway.  As were were huffing our way around a corner, up a hill, Scott suddenly picked up his pace.  A quick look ahead and Rachel knew that Scott's competative nature was kicking in.  We had come up behind a pack of cyclists.  As we passed that group of four another couple quickly came into sight.  We passed the next lady and learned that they were all on a packaged tour with Vermont Bicycle Tours.  For the remainder of our ride into Lake Louise, each time we were grunting and groaning up a hill we told ourselves that those people paid large sums of money to be able to ride this ride, so we better be appreciating it! A few miles short of Lake Louise we pulled off at a picnic spot for lunch.  We had the whole area to ourselves as we sat in the shade and enjoyed our rolls, peanut butter, cheese, salami and bananas.  Just as we were getting ready to leave a number of vehicles pulled in and the occupants of each went about getting their lunches out.  Finally, a couple on bikes pulled up and we chatted for about 20 minutes as they were just about to finish their ride to Banff from Jasper.  They got out their contour map and showed us the climbs that we had in store for us, and it was then that we realized that the major part of the Bow Pass climb was between Lake Louise and Mosquito Creek Campground, the campground that we were hoping to reach that afternoon.  After exchanging a few more stories, we could put if off no longer and we headed back out to the Bow Valley Parkway and the last few miles into Lake Louise.     As we cruised down a hill and approached the Highway 1 (Trans Canada) / Lake Louise junction we pulled over to figure out what our game plan was.  Were we going to stop for the day and enjoy the sights of Lake Louise, leaving the whole of the 30-mile climb to Bow Summit for the following day, or should we push on to Mosquito Creek Campground and split the climb over two days?  It didn't take us long to rationalize to ourselves that Lake Louise would be the same if visited on a subsequent, car camping, trip so we opted to pull into town long enough to fill our water bottles for the climb ahead, stock up our handle bar bags with a couple of chocolate bars each and then begin chipping away at our climb. After a few minutes on the Trans Canada Highway we were happy to pull off onto the Icefields Parkway.  Unlike the Bow Valley Parkway, the Icefields Parkway had a nice wide shoulder and once again we left the majority of the traffic behind on Hwy 1.  A few tenths of a mile further up the parkway we approached the fee station;  unlike the Trans Canada Highway, all traffic using the Icefields Parkway has to have a park permit to use the road.  As we didn't have a park permit we fully expected to have to pay the $14 to proceed,  but as we pulled up to the booth the attendent waved us on through saying ""I won't stop you.  Have a good day.""  We thanked her and were off, peddeling again. It wasn't long before the climb began.  The grade was relatively good, although we were both in our granny gears, but it was a long climb.  We climbed and climbed, levelling off a bit once in a while before forcing us to tackle the next stretch of elevation gain.  All the while as we made our slow progress cars were cruising past us at 40-50 mph.  We climbed for about 10 miles in the hot afternoon sun without so much as a turnout where we could pull off and rest for a bit away from the traffic.  We were forced to stop on the shoulder, which we did often to mentally prepare ourselves for the next leg and then we would be at it again.  Once we stopped and dismounted from our bikes, leaving them leaned up against a small sign post.  We took the Oop out of her trailer and we sat on the hill on the other side of the shoulder drainage ditch and tried to rehydrate ourselves by downing a bottle of water each.  Back at it again, we finally came across a small turnout, just as the hill was starting to let up.  It was 10 miles into our parkway ride and the first notation on our mile by mile road description.  It was a relief to finally reach this turnout because we now knew that we had under 5 miles to go before we reached the campground. As the road leveled off, our speed climbed from 4 mph into the low teens.  We were now batteling a bit of a headwind, (as we had been the whole way up the hill, but there it was more of a cooling blessing than a hinderance) but we took turns taking the lead so that the other rider could conserve a little energy by drafting behind.  At last the campground sign was in sight and we felt relieved and jubulent.  We had made it, and it was only just 4pm. We pulled into the campground and selected a site.  We pitched the tent and then wandered down to the junction between Bow River and Mosquito Creek.  We found a private area and had a sponge off in the cool refreshing water.  Scott was bold enough to completely submerge himself in the swift running Bow River, but Rachel, who has always hated cold water, filled a pot with water and used that to sponge herself off.   Feeling refreshed, we returned to the camp site to prepare our evening meal.  As we were in the midst of cooking a guy pulled into the site in a VW camperized Eurovan.  He asked us if there had not been a tag on the site post when we arrived, and when we informed him that there had not been one he was visibly perturbed.  He stated that he had reserved and paid for the site that morning and he wasn't sure why the campground hosts would have removed the tag.  As we already had our tent set up and were in the midst of preparing our evening meal we were in no position to vacate the site for him, but as we had pitched off the gravel pad we told him that we were happy to share the site with him.  He agreed and we then proceeded to have a very enjoyable evening with our site-mate.  His name was Tom and he is a Doctor of Internal Medicine from Kalispell, Montana.  He is in Banff for the week doing a little hiking and moutaineering.  We enjoyed his company and conversation and we sat out talking with him until it was time to change Alex for bed, give her her last bottle and put her to sleep. Tomorrow we will tackle the last, and easier, 15 miles to Bow Summit and then we should enjoy  good downhill ride for a bit.  We are looking forward to it.
"
38,"We woke up this morning to the sound of Tom, our site-mate, closing the sliding door on his EuroVan and then starting the engine and pulling out of the campground.  That was just after 7am.  In all honesty, that was the thrid time that we had been awoken;  the first time was at about 1:55am.  We don't know what it was that woke us, but we couldn't get back to sleep because of aching legs.  We hunted out the Ibuprofen (Vitamin I), took a couple capsules each and then sometime after managed to doze off again.  A couple of hours later we were woken again, but this time by the little person sleeping beside us.  Alex had decided that she wanted to play again, and we were her intended playmates.  Rather than let her get all rambuncious like she did the other night, we applied a firm hand to her torso to stop her from crawling around and then pretty soon she was asleep again, and so were we. So, at about 7:10am we woke and lounged in the tent enjoying Alex's energy and enthusiasm.  We started to emerge from the tent by about 8am and we proceeded to go through the morning routine of oatmeal, coffee / hot chocolate, and packing up.  True to form, Alex started getting fussy again about 20 minutes before we were ready to leave, but wheeling her in her trailer settled her down again, as did a visit from a neighbouring camper and her Shelty dog. We pulled out of camp at about 9:30 and started out on the highway towards Bow Summit.  We were about 11 miles short of the summit and we expected much of it to be a grind.  We were pleased to find that the first 5 miles to a viewpoint of Crawfoot Glacier and Bow Lake was about as bad as the climb was going to get.  We pulled off at the lookout, along with the tour bus loads of other tourists, and we enjoyed chatting with a few international visitors while we caught our breath and enjoyed the scenery.    Back on our bikes again we finished the 5 miles to the summit.  The climb was much more gradual now with short periods of elevation gain followed by flat portions.  At the summit we took the turnoff to the Peytro Lake where we had an early lunch and then chatted again with many tourists, some of whom we had seen at the previous turnout.  We left our bikes for a bit and took the walk up to Peytro Lake lookout, but the way was crowded with other tourists and as we didn't have our infant backpack carrier we werent in a position to take the longer lookout loop walk.  We returned back down to the parkinglot and prepared to carry on along our way. Around noon we pulled out and were immediately treated to a great 5 mile descent.  We cruised down the backside of Bow Summit, reaching speeds of 42 mph (67 km/h) and we finally appreciated what we had done all of that climbing for.  Nonetheless, the thrill of a downhill is always too short as it was soon behind us and the following 5 miles were a little more level as we rolled our way along towards Waterfowl Lake Campground.  We pulled in at the campground and found ourselves a nice site in the ""walk-in"" section of the camp, but after drinking a bottle of water each and surveying the map, we decided to push on another 17 miles toward Rampart Creek Campground.  Scott wasn't too excited about going on, especially since we thought that we might have to tackle the beginning of the Sunwapta Pass climb before we reached the camp, but as it was still early (just before 1pm) we figured that we had time to chip away at it.  There were a couple other factors that influenced our desire to push, one of which was that we only had another two of our home-made, dehydrated dinners and once those were gone we would have to make do with things like Lipton Sidekicks that just don't compare.  The second factor was that we knew that the Sunwapta Pass climb was going to be a hard one and we thought that it would be better to face it early in our day tomorrow rather than leaving ourselves 17 miles further away from it so that we would be more fatigued by the time we had to face it. We left Waterfowl Lake Campground and were soon rewarded with another nice downhill stretch toward the Saskatchewan River crossing.  We cruised along enjoying speeds in the mid 30's but then as soon as we crossed the river we were confronted with a relatively short, but steep, climb back up onto the bluff.  Just as we were about to round the top of the climb Scott whistled ahead to Rachel to inform her that he had suffered his first flat of the trip.  Fortunately, there was a gravel pullout overlookng the Saskatchewan River not more than 100 yards away.  The best part about the pullout, however, was that it had plenty of shade so we didn't have to change the flat in the blazing sun.  We pulled in, under the shade of the pine trees and proceeded to take the gear off of Scott's bike as it was a rear wheel flat.  He had the tire off the rim and the tube out in no time and then he went about looking for the pentrating object.  As suspected, it was a small piece of wire that had penetrated his tire, probably from one of the many pieces of blown auto radial tires that had littered the shoulder of the highway.  We patched the tube, removed the wire from the tire and then put the whole thing back together.  As Scott was trying to reinflate the tire he noticed that the pressure was not building up evenly in the tube.  He deflated it again and tried a couple more times only to encounter the same problem.  He finally took the tire and tube off again so that he could reseat them before he got the tire inflated properly.  We then went about reattaching the bike trailer, loading the panniers, cinching down the sleeping pads and putting the Oop back in the trailer and just as we were about to pull out again the darn tire was flat again.  Frustrated, we were back to square one, but this time we fixed the flat with a new tube.     By the time we were ready to continue our journey, about an hour had passed and in that time he wind had picked up significantly.  We peddled the 1/2 mile to the Crossing (services including store, restaurant, gas station, hotel) and by the time we got there we were pooped.  We pulled into the parking lot at The Crossing and climbed off our bikes.  We were both wondering if we had bitten off more than we could chew for the day by deciding to make another 17 miles because if the last 1/2 mile was any indication of what the remaining 7 miles were going to be like, we were sure to be in trouble.  We didn't know if we were so tired from that 1/2 mile ride because of the wind or because we had yet to ""find our legs"" again after our hour off the bikes.  Whichever it was, we weren't looking forward to the remaining 7 miles of the days ride. It seems that the wind picks up in the afternoon and as we are traveling in a south-north direction we will more often than not experience it as a headwind at this time of day.  We stopped at the store and picked up some beer to help motivate us into camp.  While we were there we chatted with a number of other tourists again, including a couple touring on a tandem.  They were on their return trip to Banff from the Icefieds and they were able to inform us that the remaining 7 miles into Rampart Creek Campground was not too bad, just a bunch of small rollers.  Apparently it is a ways past the campground that the climb over Sunwapta Pass begins.   Despite the last 7 miles being only small rollers, we had the wind in our faces and we had yet to find our legs again.  We made our way along, thinking about the taste of the cold beer awaiting us at camp.  It helped to motivate us, but those last few miles were tough.  We pulled into camp exhausted, Rachel in particular.  We found ourselves a nice camp on the river banks of the swift running Saskatchewan river.  We put up the tent and then both sat down to rest for a while and enjoy our beer.  It must have been the better part of an hour before we really got moving again, and even then it was just Scott going off to Yogi (beg, borrow or steal) some white gas camping fuel so that we could cook dinner.  By the time that Scott came back 20 minutes later, Rachel was feeling positively nauseaus and she didn't want to do much of anything except get out of the heat.  We took turns bathing down on the bank of the river which helped to cool us both off and then it was time to eat something which would be the final fix for Rachel's queeziness. While we bathed in the river, the Oop played on or about her bike trailer or car seat (which was out of the trailer as she had already been fed and the car seat doubles as a feeding chair).  She was about 20 feet away from us so that we could keep an eye on her, but there was no need because she was happy as a clam all by herself.  She sure has been a pleasure to travel with.  The whole time that we were changing the flat tire earlier in the day, she sat in the shade picking the bark off a fallen tree.  We were able to go about our business without having to give her a second thought.      After getting cleaned up we fixed ourselves a great spaghetti dinner and then followed it up with chocolate pudding.  Clean and fed, it was time to change the Oop, feed her her bedtime bottle and put her down for the night.  We handed her the bottle in the tent and left her to drink it while we attended to some cleanup chores around the camp.  We looked over at Alex a little while later and she was sitting up with the bottle in her mouth but she was on the nod, dozing off.  A few minutes later, with an empty bottle in her hand she toppled over and was down for the night.  What a great kid we have!
"
39,"Perhaps its an ominous day to be cycling, but so far we haven't faced any consequences of it being Friday the 13th.  No consequences other than the scorching heat and the long tough climb over Sunwapta Pass that is. The day started out as per usual.  Alex, however, slept in a little later than her norm and didn't disturb us until about 7:20.  We emerged from the tent shortly before 8 and went through what really is becoming a bit of a routine, complete with Alex getting fussy about 20 minutes before we are ready to leave camp.  Once again, we put her in her trailer and that did the trick.     We left the campground by about 9:30am.  We were both dreading what lay ahead as we knew we had to face Sunwapta Pass at an elevation of 6,635ft (150 feet lower than Bow Pass, but a much tougher climb).  What we didn't know was how long of a climb it would be and how much of a warm up we had out of camp before we faced it.  As it turned out, we enjoyed 10 miles of relative ease, right up to the Weeping Wall pullout.  We stopped at the pullout and chatted with a group of riders on a package adventure tour.  They had their support vehicle stopped there allowing everyone to top up their water bottles or opt to ""sag"" (take a ride) before beginning the grueling climb up the pass.  All of these riders were amazed that we would venture to do this ride, not only self-supported, but pulling a baby in a trailer as well.  The sag wagon driver offered to carry our gear up to the top for us, but we declined saying that that would be cheating.   After about a 15-minute break we started out.  The road started climbing almost immediately.  The grade was tolerable although we could see many cars pulled over at a switchback lookout a long way above us.  We groaned knowing that that switchback was probably only half way up the pass.  As we slowly made our way up the hill we were passed by all of the tour company cyclists as they were riding without the added weight of gear, but they called out encouragement as they rode by.   About 1.5 miles up we pulled off at a pullout.  We took a breather, had a bite to eat and then forged ahead to the next pullout (the one we had been able to see from far below).  We were bushed, but we were managing, bit-by-bit.  After taking our time and talking to tourists for a while we got word from some other cyclists that we only had another mile or so of climbing before the road leveled off.  With this in mind we set off again, feeling confident that we could make it. It wasn't long before that confidence faded, at least for Rachel.  Maybe it was the increasing heat of the day (high 80's to low 90's), maybe the grade got tougher, or maybe it was just that we were really beginning to feel the impact of the climb we had already made.  Scott kept moving forward, although at times it was no faster than a walking pace, but Rachel had to stop and push her bike for a bit.  She got a bad blister on her left heal from pushing her heavy bike up the steep climb and she now isn't sure which is worse, the blister or the sore muscles she would have had if she had stayed on her bike. It seemed like the progress we had made early on was just a tease and we were flogging badly on this last stretch.  The summit seemed to never come, and every time we thought that the hill was leveling off we could come around a bend and realize that there was more climbing ahead of us.  Finally when we did summit the pass we were treated to a brief downhill but the reward of it was dampened by a blasted headwind that probably robbed us of at least 5mph off our potential speed.   Once past the summit of Sunwapta Pass we still had about 4 miles to the Columbia Icefields Visitor's Center.  We pulled into the center through the bus loop and we were utterly amazed to see a whole large parking lot of tour busses lined up side by side.  We parked our bikes outside the main entrance and listened to people's amazement when we pulled a 10-month-old baby out of our trailer.  One cyclist came out of the center and commented that she had heard about us from the other riders.  She was on a self-supported ride, but was staying in Hostels along the route, and she said that all the other riders were talking about the couple that was towing the baby.     We entered the mayhem of the crowded Visitor's Center and battled the throngs of tourists at the cafeteria.  We ordered our hamburger and fries along with a bag of potato chips and a tall lemonade each.  We headed outside to eat but as all the tables on the balcony were taken we sat on the ground in the shade of the balcony wall.  In fact, it was probably better for us than a table would have been as it meant that Alex could crawl around and get a little exercise while we were out of the sun. After lunch we filled our water bottles and returned to our bikes.  We were looking forward to a speedy and exhilarating descent from the Visitor's Center.  We did enjoy a good cruise down from the center, but all too soon it was over (within less than a mile) and we were again faced with a climb.  What was with this?!  We weren't expecting another hill; it was supposed to be all downhill.  Although this climb was only about 1/4 mile in length, it was a real blow to us mentally.  If there was this hill, how many more would there be before the campground?  Once we reached the viewpoint, at the top of the hill that looked back at the icefields behind us, we found the long sustained downhill that we had been looking forward to.  It was probably about 4 or 5 miles long and we attained speeds of 46 mph (74 km/h).  We were traveling fast enough that we commanded the whole lane (or at least the car behind us was gracious enough to give it to us) and we cruised down the hill enjoying the wind in our faces and knowing that we had worked hard for it. The descent finally leveled out in an open alpine meadow area.  The road looked flat but it must have been descending still because for the next few miles we were able to sustain speeds in the high teens or low twenties without much effort.  Nonetheless, the day's challenges were beginning to get to us.  The sun was blazing on the open road and we were once again battling a constant head wind.  We had been hoping to make it about 38 miles past the Icefields Center to Honeymoon Lake Campground, but we were beginning to flounder so much that we were looking forward to coming across Jonas Creek, 14 miles shy of Honeymoon.  At last we came over a hill and nestled in the hollow of the depression beyond was the sign to Jonas Creek Campground.  We pulled in, hot and tired, and called it a day. The campground was a little open, with about 15 sites in a loop.  Every one site could see the others, but we were tired and the idea of going on to the next, more scenic Honeymoon Lake was too much to consider.  We sat on a picnic table, relaxing and drinking a bottle of water each, trying to regain some energy.  After about 20 minutes we decided to venture up the steep footpath that climbed the embankment behind the campsite loop.  There was a sign there indicating that walk-in tent sites were available up there.  Rachel carried Alex up and helped Scott push his fully laden bike up the hill to where we found another 15 or so sites.  Rachel walked around the entire loop looking for a site with a level patch and at last we settled on site #15.  We were in the shade of the pine trees, could hear Jonas Creek burbling below and we were private from all of the RV's and campers in the loop below us.     We set up the tent and then gathered our stuff together to head down to the creek for our sponge bath.  We ventured up the creek bank a little to get away from prying eyes and when we came across a grassy patch we put Alex down to play while we took turns bathing the days sweat and grime off us.  Feeling much fresher we climbed back up the hill to fix our Sheppard's Pie dinner and then retire to the tent.
"
40,"Alex didn't want to go to sleep last night.  We changed her and fed her her bottle in the tent, but two hours after her 8pm bedtime she was still clambering all over us like some big game.  Exhausted by her seemingly endless energy, we were getting frustrated as we wanted to unwind and go to sleep.  No matter what we tried, though, Alex seemed to just keep bouncing around.  Too bad that we couldn't harness some of that energy!!  At last, about 10:15pm Scott laid down with Alex, holding her in a lying position.  She fussed, tried to fight him off, and cried for a few minutes, but after about 5 minutes she was out cold, not to stir again until after 8am this morning. Rachel, on the other hand, wasn't so lucky.  She woke up at about 6:30am feeling a little nauseous.  She got out of the tent, without waking either of the other two, and went about boiling water for coffee, hot chocolate and oatmeal.  An hour later Scott was woken up with a cup of coffee in bed.  How's that for a little dose of luxury in the woods?  We began packing while Alex still slept, but around 8am we needed to get her up for her feeding and to pack her gear.  By 9:15 we were all packed and in the line up at the slow flowing water tank located in the campground parking lot.  We wanted to fill our water bottles before we pulled out and thankfully the others in line were happy to let us jump in with our small water bottles as they were trying to fill their gallon jugs. Out on the road we began a relatively easy descent down towards Jasper.  The air was still cool, the road was quiet, and with the slight descent we were making great time.  We cruised along passing by Bubbling Springs picnic area and then Sunwapta Falls with its hotel, restaurant, store and tour busses crowding it's parking lot.  A couple of minutes after that we were heading past Honeymoon Lake Campground where we had hoped to get the previous day.      After about 11/2 hours of riding we pulled off at a roadside pullout to have a little lunch of bread, peanut butter, salami and cheese.  We had managed to cover about 25 miles already and we were half way to town.  Once back on our bikes, however, we seemed to be faced with some more hills as we veered away from the bank of the Athabasca River and climbed up onto a headland.  It struck us as ironic that the river was ""falling"" over Athabasca Falls as we were climbing.  Still, despite starting to slow down a little and the wind picking up a bit, we were making good headway towards town.  At one point we stopped and chatted with a solo cycle tourist who as heading in the opposite direction.  He was from Germany and had begun his trip two months ago in Fairbanks, Alaska and had hopes of making it to Terra de Fuego, should his mind and pocket book hold out that long.  We were envious of his journey as it has always been a dream of Scott's to cycle both the Americas.  At last we were crossing the Athabasca River and nearing Jasper town site and campgrounds as we road past Wapiti Campground on the right and then Whistlers Campground on the left.   Just before we reached the Yellowhead Highway that connects east to west we crossed the Miette River and we came upon a large elk grazing at the side of the road.  Being that we were on bicycles and that we were riding on the shoulder of the road this elk looked HUGE.  We were quite close to him and we must have startled him a little bit because he almost jumped and then quickly moved off the embankment down into the bush along side the road.   At last we made it across the Yellowhead Highway and into the town of Jasper.  We had driven past the Yellowhead / Hwy 93 junction many times on our Vancouver to Edmonton travels, but now that we were going northbound through the intersection and on our bicycles the junction seemed to have a very different impression on us.  We had completed our journey.  We had cycled from Banff to Jasper.  As we rode into town we were struck by the amount of tourist traffic clogging Connaught Street and our enthusiasm for having completed our ride quickly waned. We weren't much in the mood for celebrating because while one aspect of our adventure was now complete, but we still had another adventure ahead of us:  figuring out how we were going to get our car back from Canmore. We road through town and pulled in at the Jasper Railway Station as the building also houses car rental booths as well as the Greyhound Bus depot office.  As the Greyhound agent was busy with another customer we enquired first at the car rental booths.  None of them had a vehicle that required a drop in Banff, Canmore or Calgary so they all wanted to charge us the rental price plus a $150 drop charge on the vehicle.  Next we tried the bus depot but the agent informed us that the only bus line that goes along the parkway is Brewster's and that their office is located across the street in the lobby of the movie theatre.  So, across the street we went and we were distressed to find out that there is only one bus a day from Jasper to Banff and that it left about 1/2 hour earlier.  We were running out of viable options quickly.  We decided to head back to one of the campgrounds to get Scott and the Oop situated and then Rachel would try to hitch a ride back to Canmore.  We got a walk-in site and then Rachel quickly changed into her camp clothes and rushed out to the highway as the day was slipping away from us and each passing car was a missed opportunity.  She got out onto the highway and began walking south so that she could get past Wapiti Campground to reduce the amount of local traffic passing her by.  It was hot walking along the road without the benefit of a cycle-generated breeze, but fortunately she only had to walk a couple hundred yards before the driver of the twentieth-or-so car picked her up.  Wouldn't you know that the girl who picked Rachel up was driving straight through to Canmore; what luck!   What could have been a multi-hitch journey leapfrogging from one tourist attraction to the next, ended up being a straight through ride.  Three and a half hours after stepping out onto the highway, Rachel was being dropped off at our van in Canmore.  Now all she had to do was drive back to Whistlers Campground to pick up Scott and the Oop.
"
41,"We believe that the Icefields Parkway has the potential to be truly spectacular, but as with so many things in life, it all depends on timing.  For example, while we were fortunate enough to have fine weather for the whole trip, bad weather (which can come upon you very quickly in the Canadian Rockies) could make for a miserable trip.  Conversely, we were not fortunate enough to see any wildlife other than that one elk as we were about to enter Jasper town site, and one bunny rabbit crossing the road about 10 km prior to that.  We were really disappointed at the lack of wildlife, but acknowledge that if we had been fortunate enough to encounter bear, herds of elk, moose, big horned sheep and mountain goats along our journey it would have made for a much more spectacular trip.  Unfortunately, we weren't that lucky.  Finally, we didn't encounter as many other cycle tourists as we had hoped.  Knowing that this trip is so renowned for touring, I guess I had envisioned sharing campgrounds with other cyclists, or at least leap-froging with them throughout the days rides.  While we did see a number of other cycle tourers, they were either on packaged tours or we encountered them going in the opposite direction.   My recommendations to anybody else thinking of doing this ride, is to really take your time with it.  We were under a bit of a time restraint and because of that the trip became too much about making the mileage.  I think it would have been more enjoyable if we had taken a couple of extra days, limited our mileage so that we spent less time in the saddle and had more time to explore the side trips and sights of the Parkway.  Taking a good guide book with you  would also give you an opportunity to read up on the sights that you are seeing along the way, and therefore increase your appreciation of them.  While a guidebook tailored to the cycle tourist would be optimal, here is a website that provides a pretty good description of some of the highlights along the Icefields Parkway ( http://www.nationalgeographic.com/destinations/Banff_National_Park/Icefields_Parkway_Drive.html )  This description should serve to wet your appetite for this beautiful ride and provide you with a modicum of info to start you off. Traveling with an Infant            As far as traveling with an infant, well, it was certainly more challenging, but as she is a part of our family we couldn't imagine leaving her behind.  Logistically, traveling with an infant means more gear.  Anyone who has had children will be able to tell you that there seems to be an endless list of ""necessities"", but once you find a way to whittle it down or pack it all the joys of having your little one with you make it worthwhile.   We should have planned for shorter days in the saddle so as to allow Alex more time out of her trailer and for this purpose, perhaps the Icefields Parkway was not the best choice of rides with an infant;  we found ourselves unable to take advantage of many of the scenic walks and attractions as we didn't have a stroller or backpack carrier with us.  A trip that passes by lots of grassy parks would have been a better choice for us at this time so that Alex could have played and crawled around.   Alex was just over 10 months old when we did this trip.  While she was crawling she was not walking.  There were many occasions when we commented to ourselves that we were thankful for this.  We thought that if she had been toddling she would have been much more of a handful in camp.  We would have been unable to turn our backs on her for the fear that she might toddle across to the next campsite or worse, into a nearby river or something.  I am sure that next year we will experience the extra challenges presented as an infant learns to walk.   "
42,"    Last year, I took a week in 2003 and rode across Iowa on RAGBRAI.  That trip hooked me on the idea of long bicycle trips.  On last year's ride I was sagged by the ever capable service of the Keokuk Iowa Bike Club.  They would haul all my camping gear and as much crap as I felt I would need from town to town so I could enjoy riding without lugging all the gear with me and worry about were and who I would be camping with.   There were about 50 other 'club members' who helped keep an eye on each other.  For instance, one day three of us decided to enjoy the Beer Garden in the town before the end of the days ride.  When we finally wove ourselves into camp at only 7:00 p.m., we were greeted with real concern about our whereabouts, if we had any problem, etc.  Normal bikers were in camp before 5:00 p.m.  I had a great time but missed the challenge of doing it myself. Since last summer I began accumulating the gear I would need to ride solo.  The first purchase was my recumbent bike.  I knew I wanted a recumbent even before last years RAGBRAI which I rode on a 20 year old Ryan 10-speed with drop handlebars.  There aren't any recumbent dealers anywhere close to home so I resorted to shopping on EBay.  In January I was able to snag a 2000 Vision model R44 for under $800 from a fellow in Rockford, IL.  I was so anxious to get my 'bent' that I met him the next day in central Illinois.  Actually it saved $100 shipping.  Yeah I'm that tight! When I brought it back and took my first ride on a cold February day, I felt like a little kid again.  My wife, Kim, thought I was nuts, but did like the idea of the big comfortable seat.  The bike is a deep purple color.  Kim's sister came up to visit and check out the bike.  I was struggling to come up with a good name for it and thought Plum Pretty sounded okay.  She said anyone would have to be Plum Crazy to think about riding that contraption, so that became my bike's name.  Plum Crazy! Over the next few months I added the gear I would need for self-supported bike touring.  My main sources were the websites of crazyguyonabike.com and the late Ken Kifer.  On the first I read numerous journals made by folks who toured across states, this country and even around the world.  On Ken's pages I found lots of practical advice on what to bring.  Sadly Ken was killed while riding his bike just last year a few miles from his home by a drunken driver.  For now his close friends are keeping his website up and running.   Now that the gear was coming together I had to decide where to ride.  I knew my time limit and budget would only allow for 1 or 2 weeks off work.  This May our daughter Mandy graduated from Truman State in Kirksville, MO.  She and her husband then moved to Kansas City so she could go to graduate school at Rockhurst University and study Occupational Therapy. Her husband Justin found a counseling job at the Truman Medical Center in K.C. too.  Their location all the way across Missouri from our home in Ursa, IL on the bluff of the Mississippi River got me thinking of the route I would eventually take. I decided to ride from their apartment in North Kansas City (only 2 miles from the Kansas border) to Booneville, MO on the Missouri River.  Then I would take the KATY Bike Trail from there to sister-in-law Tammy's house in St Peter's Missouri.  From there I would cross the Mississippi River on the Chain of Rocks Bridge and follow the Illinois and Mississippi Rivers back north to our home. The best time based on work schedule and family commitments to take this trip turned out to be the middle two weeks in August.  This is usually some of the most hot and humid weather in this part of the world.  Usual daytime highs reach well into the 90's with the humidity at 90% too.  Frequent thunderstorms can pop-up at anytime.  I would have to plan for these conditions. I found loads of information about the KATY Trail and the services available on the Missouri DNR website.  I already had Bicycle specific maps for Illinois.  Anyone can get these free from the Illinois Department of Transportation website.  Finally, I used my Adventure Cycling membership to pick-up a discounted map for the section of the Lewis & Clark Bike Trail that crossed Missouri.  In fact the Lewis & Clark map had me covered the whole way, except for the familiar Illinois section to get back home.
"
43,"I began packing my two panniers and bike rack like I had done on my dry-runs at home.  At that time I discovered that the fully loaded bike weighed 60 pounds.  I weigh 185, so I am just short of 250 pounds.  As usual I had to re-pack, and then re-pack again until I was finally satisfied with the set-up.  Around 7:40 I said my goodbye to son-in-law, Justin who was in the shower getting ready for work.  Mandy helped me carry the bike down from their second floor apartment, took a couple photos and I was off.  After about 50-ft I stopped to zero the odometer, then I was off for good.    The bike seemed heavy, but stable as I climbed up the first hill to Barry Road.  Barry Road parallels busy MO-152 across North Kansas City.  I would follow Barry Road until I had to jump back on MO-152 to get across I-35.  Even at 7:40 a.m., this road was eerily quiet for the morning rush hour.  Many areas of this part of town are undeveloped, but the signs are there that soon the hills will be filled with homes and everything else. As I approached Liberty, MO I took the opportunity for my first 2nd breakfast of this trip at a Waffle House.  You don't know what 2nd breakfast is?  That's one of the things I like about biking early in the morning.  You'll start your day with breakfast, which I did at Mandy's with a couple bowls of Honey Nut Cheerios.  Then you stop for a real breakfast of eggs and hash browns, or whatever, after riding about 10-miles.   This Waffle House seemed to be filled with the in-between crowd of single mothers with kids, some retired folk and a couple of workers who managed to sneak a breakfast during working hours.  I ate my meal while listening to the jukebox.  Somebody had picked the Beach Boys, Shania Twain, Harry Chapin and Rod Stewart to eat breakfast by.  Speaking of coffee, you'd think the Waffle House would make an above average cup, but I had to rate this stuff as well below average.  It had a distinct dishwasher taste to it.      As I was paying the bill the waitress asked the usual questions.  You know, where your from, where your coming from, how far you been and where your going.  When I said I planned to camp in Higginsville that night she said that she camps all over and there isn't any campground in Higginsville.  Great, I might have to resort to sleeping behind the Police or Fire Station my first night out. In Liberty I got lost, so pulled into a Conoco Station where I picked up that pack of Trident my teeth needed and directions.  Ahh, my mouth now feels minty fresh.  Liberty looks like a nice clean town on the fringe of K.C.  They are the home of William-Jewel College, which I passed by, and have an historic Jail.  I wonder who was kept there, but didn't feel I had time to find out if I was to make Higginsville by nightfall.  Besides, it looked like I would need to climb a steep hill to visit it. The route I selected to skirt K.C. and connect me to the Lewis & Clark Bike Trail, Route EE was rolling hills.  The first hills of many I would see over the next two days.  You see, I'm from the flat prairie land of Illinois.  The largest hill we have is about 150-ft tall.  I was climbing and descending hills of this size and larger regularly all morning.  Already, I was seeing my anticipated average travel rate drop from 13 mph towards 10 mph.  Finally I break free of these hills and drop into the bottomlands of the Missouri River at Missouri City.  I need a restroom bad, so I dash off-route into town.  I find the school getting ready to open and rush in.  Feeling much better, I ride through town.  This is where I spy my first Lewis & Clark kiosk.  It seems Missouri has erected interpretive markers wherever Lewis & Clark stopped or did something significant on their Voyage of Discovery.      Leaving Missouri City I came across one of the saddest things I saw on the trip.  There were three white crosses along the roadside with the names of Lacey, Lacey and Rachel.  Obviously, these three girls were well loved.  A mini shrine was set-up with stuffed animals, balloons, candles and toys.  The crosses had to have been signed by 50 people each.  Personally, I don't like the idea of memorial crosses on the road right-of way.  I mean if everyone followed that custom, it could become quite distractive driving around. How could the highway department easily maintain the roadways without messing up somebody's personal shrine?  Maybe the solution is to find a place like those old lane rest stops with a picnic table, a nice shade tree and a smelly outhouse where you could erect your own personal memorial, but leave the main roadway free and clear.  Wait a minute I think they call those cemeteries.  Anyway, the point I'm trying to make is traveling in a car you would have whizzed by these three crosses without a second glance, but riding a bike I could make out all the details as I approached.  I couldn't pass by without stopping, saying a little prayer to the three girls I never knew and wish them peace.    A few miles down the road, I came across the next strange site.  An abandoned car was just sitting on the shoulder.  Now I'm out in the Missouri bottoms and can see there is no one for miles, yet here on the side of the road is this parked car.  Again whizzing by in your car at 60 mph you wouldn't give it much thought, but as I ride up I see that the windows appear broken out.  My C.S.I. sense told me something wasn't right.  The passenger window was smashed in and the driver's window was smashed out.  The keys were lying on the seat and all the license plates were missing.  Packs of half empty cigarettes were lying on the back seat.  Now I was suspicious!  As much as a pack of Marlboro's cost, nobody was going to leave them lying about.  As a good citizen, I got my cell phone out and reported to 911.  They didn't ask my name, just where the car was and if it was a traffic hazard.  It only took them 30 seconds to take the information, and I'll bet that dark blue Mazda is still sitting on the westbound shoulder of MO-210 about 2 miles east of Missouri City as you read this.    Outside of Orrick I came across a sign for Route's O & Z.  I now know I wasn't in Kansas (City) anymore.  So whistling 'We're off to see the Wizard', I headed into Orrick for lunch at the Fubbler's Cove café.  I love small town diners.  If you just listen, you can find out a lot about the community.  This place had the usual lunch crowd where half are local retiree's and half were local workers.  What was unusual was how quiet everyone was.  Everyone talked in hushed tones.  It was kind of spooky.      The walls were painted with murals showing farmers planting potatoes in muddy fields from some scene of the early 20th Century.  I asked the waitress about them and she whispered that the area was settled by Irish immigrants and this area was once known for its Potatoes.  Well, I wanted to tell her if that was the case that this place should do better than the typical frozen French fries they served me, but decided I should quietly get out of town before I made a ruckus and woke these quiet folk up. Leaving town I got lost for the second time.  This one cost me about 5 miles before I realized the sun should be over my other shoulder.  I continued my beautiful ride along the toe of the Missouri River bluffs until Henrietta.  I was ready for a soda break, but there were no services in this town, so I turned south on MO-13.  Now the number 13 should have been a warning, but I was thinking about the cold soda I could get in Lexington on the other side of the Missouri River.  Only trouble was the 7 miles to there involve riding on a two lane road with fairly heavy traffic, no shoulders and some of the most inconsiderate drives I've ever come across.   Redneck is the word I'll use to describe some of the drivers.  Like I said, the road was full of late afternoon traffic.  Whenever I have to ride in those conditions, my attention is mainly focused on riding the white edge line and staying with inches of the right edge of pavement.   The first incident occurred as I was hugging the white line.  I can hear traffic both approaching from behind and coming at me.  If everyone stays calm, there will be plenty of room for two vehicles and a loaded touring bike to pass.  This generally will involve having the driver approaching my rear to slow and ease onto the centerline while the oncoming car slows and eases onto that lanes outer edge.  The key word here is to SLOW down.  In this incident I hear an SUV approaching from behind without slowing down.  I look down to see if there were even a few inches more I could slide to the right as I see a large soda cup full of ice pass between my wheels without hitting me.  It was thrown from the passing SUV and clearly visible to others in that line of traffic.  Now that was either the best shot or about the stupidest thing anyone could do to a fully loaded cyclist on a busy, narrow road.  Luckily, I didn't weave my bike out into traffic. The second incident happened a few miles later while I was still fuming about the thrown cup of ice.  I was within sight of the bridge into Lexington and the road is still a narrow, two-lane without shoulders.  I hear a large truck approaching from my rear.  There is no oncoming traffic this time so I don't even glance in my rear view mirror.  I just assume this 18-wheeler is sliding over into the left lane while passing me.  But NO, this redneck stays in 'our' lane and is doing about 60 mph.  He brushes within 6-inches of me.  I felt this vacuum of air that tries to pull the bike and me even closer to the truck, but my guardian angel was by my side this day.   Yes, I believe I have a personal guardian angel whose name is Alphonse.  I'll call it divine intervention, but here on this day within 20 minutes, Alphonse was there to see that the cup of ice thrown by the redneck passed between my wheels without touching me and that the redneck driver of that gravel truck missed me too.  From my earliest childhood memories Alphonse has been my invisible friend and guardian.  Thanks for being there Alphonse.   Now I still have to cross this long two-lane bridge.  A bridge that's so narrow trucks are forced to slow to be sure they don't lose a mirror to each other in passing.  I start up and over this 1.5 mile bridge and decide to just take the center of my lane and make the rednecks either run me over or wait till they can pass on my left.  I get over without further incident and only a few verbal comments thrown my way.  As I crawled up the bluff into Lexington, I was ready for a break.  My first stop was at the statue to Madonna of the Santa Fe Trail.  It's a statue of a Missouri women pioneer's who starting on the Santa Fe Trail from Lexington, MO.  Now when I went to school, I thought I learned the trail started in Independence, MO.  Not so Amigo.  Lexington claims that honor.   I would find out later that Franklin, Missouri also claims that honor.  In fact it seems that about every town in western Missouri where any drifter at one time or another left for Santa Fe, today now claims to be the true start of the Santa Fe Trail.  They justify their claim and erect some monstrous statute to justify their claim.  Most often it depicts some buxom women with eyes straining westward and little children hanging on her skirts.      The downtown area of Lexington at first glance looks well maintained.  It is the county seat and has a courthouse with the obligatory memorials to veterans and other significant citizens.  Just like their claim to be the true the start of the Santa Fe, Lexington also claims to be the true start of the Pony Express.  Again, I guess I was misled in my education that taught me it started in Saint Joseph, Missouri.   No!  According to the Lexington version of history prominently written on an historic sign on the corner of the courthouse lawn, the fellows responsible for the Pony Express were citizens of Lexington when they dreamed the idea up in some tavern, mason lodge or some such place.  Since the IDEA occurred in Lexington, Missouri, they claim to be the start of the Pony Express.  The history according to Lexington points out that Saint Joseph was just the first Station on the Pony Express and that Leavenworth, Kansas was merely the Headquarters.  Why they even solidify their claim by pointing out that after the Pony Express went bankrupt those gentlemen retired back to this fair city to erect statues and other great civic achievements. Lexington was also the site of a Civil War battle.  As I learned on this trip, most of the Missouri River towns were overwhelmingly pro-Southern.  This was mainly due to the large number of slaves needed as laborers on the river boats and related industry.  When hostilities broke out, these towns quietly supported the southern cause.  Lexington, like most river towns, was occupied by the Union army who garrisoned troops there to separate northern Missouri from the strongly pro-confederate southern Missouri.   It seems that in September of 1861, a Confederate Army of 10,000 reinforced by another 10,000 confederate local sympathizers bumped into the 3,000 men of the Union garrison in Lexington.  The Battle of Lexington raged around the town for three days.  When it was done, the Rebels had won the day.  They held the town for a few weeks until the Union got serious and chased them back down south again.  As I rode through town I would spy confederate flags and pro-confederate memorials.  Being a Yankee from the Land of Lincoln, felt my welcome wearing out in Lexington, so I rode south and east towards the town of Higginsville. The last fifteen miles to my intended campground in Higginsville were hilly, hot and into head winds.  I was one whipped puppy as I limped into town.  My first stop was at a Wal-mart to buy a toothbrush.  The second stop was at roadside diner for supper.  Finally, around 6:30 p.m. I limped to the south edge of town where I found the city campground.  The free tent camping area was on the lawn next to a row of pine trees and behind the Parks & Recreation building.  It was right next to the in-door washrooms, but there would be no shower tonight.  The shower was at the city swimming pool which had already closed for the season.  Across the street was a tennis court that would keep me well illuminated until around 11:00 p.m. when the last players left for the night. At the campground I met a fellow touring cyclist.  I never wrote his name down, but I believe his first name was Ed.  Anyway, that is what I called him for the next couple days.  It seems we are traveling the same route tomorrow.  Ed is meeting his wife in Columbia, just off the Katy Trail in two days, while I plan to ride it all the way to Illinois.   Ed left his Mother's house in Breckinridge, Missouri today and rode into Higginsville.  Tomorrow we both plan to camp in New Franklin on the KATY Trail.  We exchanged pleasantries while I set up camp next to his.  Ed has done this bike touring few times before, so I was pumping him with questions based on my limited experience.  Thanks to ear plugs, I drifted to sleep while the locals played tennis next door. Overall, this was one of the weirdest days of my biking career.  What a way to start my trip.   "
44,"We reached the north edge of town and join MO-20 which will take us east the next 25 miles to Marshall, MO.  I stop to visit the Missouri Confederate Memorial Cemetery while Ed rides on.  We plan to camp together in New Franklin.  The Confederate Cemetery is located in this well landscaped site that once housed the Missouri Confederate Veterans Home.  I ride the two mile loop route reading the information kiosk's on my way to visit the old graveyard.  They have two cemeteries.  The older cemetery has rows of granite tombstones with this massive statue erected by the Daughters of the Confederacy in its center.  The statue shows a reclining lion that is mortally wounded by a broken spear that's pierced its side.  It is suppose to represent the Confederacy, mortally wounded but defiant and proud to the end.  Like I said, this part of Missouri feels very pro-southern even today.    Back on the road it looks like I will have a lot of long rolling hills on the ride to Marshall before I can enjoy breakfast.  The road has very light traffic and half of it is a very smooth concrete surface.  The weather is still mostly clear and the temperature is rising toward 80. It ends up being 30 miles to Marshall.  Marshall is another county seat.  I ride around the courthouse square and ask for the favorite local diner.  I am directed back the way I came and as I pull up I see Ed's bike sitting right there.  Now I rode right by this spot 5 minutes earlier trying to see everything and didn't see Ed's bike.  I need some coffee. When I get inside, Ed is just finishing up.  He has been visiting with some local who has shared some of Marshall's claims to fame.  Ed sits through my breakfast of biscuits & gravy and a few cups of good coffee so we can ride together to see Marshall's major attraction.  That would be the grave of Jim the Wonder Dog.   It seems this local resident owned an average hunting dog that at 3 years old suddenly was able to perfectly understand any spoken command.  Later, the dog named Jim was found to be able to follow written instructions.  Not just those written in English, but any written language including Japanese.  Why this dog was said to understand telegraph signals and could identify colors.  The dog and its owner put on shows for the local folk and at the county fair.  One of the dog's favorite tricks was to be told to go find a car with a certain license plate.  Jim would run around the parking lot until he found it.   Finally, Jim the Wonder Dog was sent to the University of Missouri, Veterinary Department where they ran a whole battery of tests.  They determined the dog had a larger and more active brain than a typical dog of that breed, but otherwise was normal.  They found no reason for the dog's outstanding abilities.  Apparently, the owner refused offers to profit in any large measure from Jim's abilities.  He was featured in Ripley's Believe it or Not and several other publications at the time.   The dog died at age 12 and the whole town went in mourning.  The dog is buried in the town cemetery and is the most visited and decorated grave there.  Ed and I spent an enjoyable time reading all the claims about Jim the Wonder Dog's abilities.  Ed even remembers reading a book about him in grade school.  Very Strange.  What is it about this area?    We left town together, but again Ed was a much faster rider and we soon became separated.  We met 15 miles later at Arrow Rock State Park.  The large and beautiful park was empty but for maybe 10 visitors.  This town and the State Park that has been preserved to look like it did in the mid 1800's.  Much the same way Nauvoo, IL has been resotred.  They have an excellent Visitor Center where you can read all about the local Indians, Lewis & Clark passing by, Daniel Boone son's salt making business and the staring point of the Santa Fe Trail.   Ed went to watch the 20 minute video while I walked through the exhibits and then went into town to find a cold drink.  It had gotten quite hot and humid by now.  I sat down with a couple of cold sodas and wrote out a postcard home.  Ed had already left town by the time I went looking for him.  Twenty more miles of hot, humid and hilly countryside brought me into Boonville.  Boonville is on the Missouri River and is the place I join the KATY Trail.  In Boonville I ate at a Chinese Restaurant since I correctly didn't think I would find much at the campground town.  Boonville seems like a pretty big town.  They have a Casino, which I never saw, and an active downtown with lots of shops.  I found yet another statue to Missouri women pioneers and more mentions of the Santa Fe Trail starting near there.      I was getting pretty tired and ready to stop for the night so I just rolled through this neat downtown and across the new and wide bridge.  Once across the river I joined the KATY Trail which will be my route for the next 150 miles from here to St Charles, MO.      The KATY consists of a hard packed limestone chat surface that is approximately 8-ft wide.  It is wide enough in most places for two bikes to ride side by side.  Weeds grow along the edges.  Some parts are through forest while others are through cultivated bottomlands.  About half the time one rides in shade.  There are no hills since it is an abandoned railroad, but there are some steep ramps to cross over levees.   I was unsure how my recumbent bike would do on the unpaved surface of the KATY Trail.  I have fairly wide 1-3/8' tires but didn't know they'd do or how loose the surface would be.  I've never really ridden on unpaved surfaces before.  All the gravel roads around me are loose and so rough as to be impractical for my kind of bike.  This trails surface seems solid enough to comfortably ride on with just a bit more effort required to maintain the same 10 mph pace. I soon ride through Franklin passing a weedy trailer campground.  A mile further and I am in New Franklin where the campground is supposed to be.  I can't find it.  Asking around I find out it was back in Franklin.  So I back track and finally discover the mosquito infested, tall grass converted pasture tent camping area next to a shower house.  There I also reconnect with Ed.  I pay the $6 camping fee and set-up the tent.  Thank God I remembered the bug repellent.  Those were some hunger bugs until I covered myself in spray. Rain moved in although it never amounted to more than steady sprinkles, but it made it impractical to stay outside.  So after a long hot shower I spent the evening in the tent reading and planning the next days ride.  I fell to sleep early since it gets dark around 8:00 p.m.
"
45,"I start out at 6:45 knowing that 'fast Eddy' would soon catch up.  We had decided to breakfast in Rocheport, a town about 10 miles down the trail.  Sure enough about halfway there, Ed catches up.  I am glad since being the first one on the trail I am constantly riding through spider webs spun across the trail.  I find I am capable of about 9 mph on the hard-pack limestone trail.  This seems about 3 or 4 mph slower than I was doing on the roads. Ed will be splitting off soon to ride into Columbia.  He is to meet his wife at noon there.  His ride today will only be 30 miles.  Ed is riding a 20-year-old, 18-speed Trek bike with two panniers, a handlebar bag and a 1-man tent.  He has a GPS unit mounted to the bike and uses a heart rate monitor.  When we ride together I hear a constant beep beep beep from his monitor telling me I am keeping him 'out of the zone'.  He doesn't seem to mind though and we ride side by side to the Trailhead Café at Rocheport. We get there just before 8:00 and are ready for a meal, but find the café won't open before 9:00.  We take a ride around town since my information shows there are 5 places to eat in town.  Finding none, I stop at the Post Office.  Postmasters are a great source of local information.  There we find out that the other four restaurants in town don't open before 11:00.  It's the Trailhead café or nothing. Ed doesn't want to sit around for an hour so we part ways.  I wish him Godspeed and a safe journey back to Virginia.  It has been nice to share some time with him. I kill the time until the diner finally opens by riding around the town and reading all the literature at the town Kiosk.  Just about every town on the trail has there own kiosk, which tells their story and where Lewis & Clark slept near there too.  While there a couple rides up from the west.  They were the ones from that pop-up camper.  He is about 55 and she looks late 40's.  They are a childless couple from Boulder, Colorado and are retired.  Having no commitments they closed up their house and are making their way to Maine and the Acadia Park.  They brought their bikes and were riding this picturesque portion of the trail before driving into Columbia to check out the college town. Finally the café opens and I wolf down three pancakes and coffee.  It was not worth the wait.  I am anxious to get rolling since I have a longish day of riding planned, especially if I want to have time to tour the state capitol building in Jeff City. The next six miles are spectacular with 200-ft tall limestone cliffs rising on my left and a 50-ft high bank of the Missouri River on my left.  Here are a few views from this section.      The next town with any real service is McBane, which is about 26 miles from Rocheport.  While riding alone and in the quiet early morning I spy lots of wildlife.  Over the next three days on the trial I will see these birds: cardinals, indigo buntings, crow, gold finches, turkeys and turkey vultures.  The mammals I see include: squirrels, raccoon, deer, and a vole mouse.  The reptiles I see are turtles, small lizards and a few small snakes.  There are lots of butterflies flitting about including yellow swallowtails, monarchs, and some blue-black kind that looked like swallowtails. On the trail I came across a Park Ranger.  She was repairing gates that were damaged by vandals.  The gates are there to discourage vehicles from driving on the trail, although they can be easily bypassed.  Even though it must be tempting to ride a 4-wheeler on the trail, I never saw any unauthorized vehicle use of the trail during the 150 miles I rode on it. The Ranger cautioned me to drink lots of water since it was to be in the 90's and humid again today.  I don't know if she says that to all the trail users or if I looked that bad.  Actually, I found riding on the trail much cooler than riding on the road.  About half the time one is riding in shade and the white limestone doesn't radiate heat anything like black asphalt. Later I pass a man and two boys carrying backpacks.  They look like they are hiking this portion of the trail. I roll through a camping area in Easley.  The campsites are right on the bank of the river.  The area has that 'counter-culture' hippy feel to it.  That retired couple I met earlier would fit right it here.  They have this camp store/café/bar thing within easy walking distance of the campsites.  The place is situated on a bend of the river and has mile long river views in two directions.  It would be very tempting to stop if it was closer to 4:00 p.m. rather than the 10:30 a.m. it is.   About ten miles further I run into Wrong (sp?).  He is an 8-year student of Finance from St. Louis University.  Wrong is from China and decided to hike the trail before the fall semester starts.  His longest day was 28 miles and hopes for a short one today to rest his feet.  He is heading to the Easley campground.  He is excited because today, Wednesday is Thai cookout night at the café.  He said his mouth was already watering.    A little past noon I roll into Hartsburg.  They have a plenty of services, but the bike shop is closed.  Fortunately, 'Plum Crazy' is rolling along just fine, only my baggage is getting a little dusty from the trail.  Next-door is Dotty's Café.  I enjoy their 'blue-plate special' of fried chicken with mashed potatoes and green beans.  The gravy is that good milk gravy that can make a meal by itself with a couple pieces of bread. Mmm Mmm.  I dawdle a little and write some notes for this journal. In checking my progress so far I realize there just isn't time to take the side trip over to see the Capitol.  I've briefly visited the capitol before, but was looking forward to leisurely explore it and pick-up another disposable camera.  I decide to press onto the Steedman and the nest possible campground instead. View of Missouri Capitol Dome in Jefferson City from trail I roll into Jim's Bar & Grill in Tebbetts at 4:00 p.m.  I am ready for a beer and air conditioning.  I sit there for two beers talking to the barkeep Carina, whose husband is serving in Iraq right now.  To get to Tebbetts I've traveled 57 miles on the trail and as I leave it's already 4:30 p.m.  I still need to ride a good 20 miles to a recommended campsite in Bluffton, but I am getting tired.  I also feel I am rushing by things when I should be dawdling more.  I need to remind myself this is a vacation not a race.  However, there are limited services in this section of the trail and unless I breakdown and stay at a B & B I must press on. I put my head down and start pedaling again.  I pass through Mokane and stop just long enough to check out their General Store.  I get to Steedman at 5:30.  Now I've been told you can camp out front of the S.O.B. (Steedman's Only Bar), but there is no shower and the place looks kind of crappy.  There isn't anything in this town but a post office, a church and the bar.  I do stop in for a beer and burger since this is the last place to eat before the next campground in Bluffton. I finally pull into Bluffton at 7:30 p.m., just 30 minutes until sunset.  The campground is very nice.  It is a converted dairy farm.  The grass is mown short and it sits up in the hills, just off the trail.  The check-in is self-service.  The price is $9 but I only have $7 or a $20.  Since no one is around to make change, they only get $7 for my stay. I find a spot way back in the woods next to the very clean shower house.  The only toilets are pit toilets though.  I am the only one here.  This is the between season they tell me.  The spring and early summer are usually busy for the KATY Trail towns.  August is usually hot and slow and then business picks back up when the leaves change in September and October. I hurriedly set up camp and gather my towel and head for the shower.  I enjoy a nice long hot shower, but when I come out I realize that I left my clean clothes back at the tent.  Now what to do?  Should I re-dress in my sweaty biking clothes or walk naked back to the camp?  I peak out.  It doesn't appear anyone has come in while I've showered, but I can't see the whole campsite either.  Oh well, you're on vacation Doug.  So I stroll out proudly to my campsite.  Besides it's gotten quite dark while I showered.  I'm almost back to my tent when something flies within inches of my face.  At first I thought it was a large wood bee.  They are around the campsite, but when it happens again I realize it is a bat.  In fact there are dozens of the furry flying mammal swooping about.  That causes this naked old man to pick up the pace and dash into the tent. Of course, I forgot to pack a flashlight but do have a couple of those chemical snap lights.  I light an orange one and stay in the tent reading and writing until I can't keep my eyes open anymore.  In this vacant and dark campground the only noises are tree frogs singing, other frogs croaking and a lone hoot owl somewhere in the woods.  The temperature drops during the night making it easy to sleep.  There isn't any cell phone service here, so I can't check in at home.  Oh well, I hope they don't worry.
"
46,"   Hermann is a quaint town with strong German roots.  They say the countryside looks much like the Rhineland in Germany.  The town has 3 wineries.  In fact most towns along the KATY Trail from here to St Charles have at least one winery.  (Trail Riders note they serve free samples!)  Most weekends Hermann is jammed with people visiting the wineries.  They have major festivals each weekend in May and October.  Being a weekday in August, I discovered a quiet, sleepy town.  The closest winery, the Hermanhoff, was closed too.  Damn, I started too early again.  I picked up another disposable camera at a grocery store and the clerk recommended the Rivertown Café in downtown Hermann for breakfast.  Actually, she first tried to send me to a place on top of a huge hill.  When I frowned she made a second recommendation.  I reached the café at 9:30.  I ordered a big hearty, country fried steak breakfast with coffee.   Across from me were a catholic priest and two older ladies.  I got the impression it was his regular routine to drink coffee with these ladies here everyday.  As he started to get up and pay his bill, the ladies wouldn't let him.  They went through this long scene that I'm sure was played out everyday.  The Father would protest, and then the ladies would beg the Father to let them buy, just this once.  Finally the Father would relent and one of the ladies would go pay while Father made the rounds visiting with everyone else in the cafe.  Since I was sitting near the register, I heard the cashier say, as usual, the father's coffee was free.  Crossing the river into Hermann, MO I took a ride after breakfast around the downtown area.  I spied a bike shop, but of course it was closed.  Not that I needed any work done but   I also found a large museum in a restored building.  They were promoting their link to Lewis & Clark, so I thought I'd check it out.  As I walked up I could look in the ground floor windows.  Half of the first floor was filled with some dusty historic 'pioneer' furniture.  Another fourth of that floor was a gift shop featuring the standard tourist/museum kitsch.  (Isn't kitsch German for crap!)  A stairway led to the second floor where I'm sure all the good stuff was kept, but before I could go further I was asked to pay a $2 admission.  Well now I'm usually not one to make a fuss over $2, but for the past 3 days I've read kiosk after kiosk about L&C from here to K.C.  For some reason I didn't think I would find anything new for my $2 about their night's stay near Hermann.  I believe the kiosk across the river told me they saw a bear and killed 3 deer somewhere near here in 1804.  I guess I'm getting a little tired of the Corps of Discovery schtuff. Before I cross back over the river I visit a display about steamboats that were made in or regularly visited Hermann in the mid 1800's.  I spend 20 minutes soaking up all that FREE history.  One little tidbit this civil engineer did discover was regarding the Missouri Pacific Railroad.  Today this is the Union Pacific RR and runs along the south shoreline of the Missouri River from St Louis through Jefferson City to Kansas City.  Anyway, it tells about when in 18something, the M.P.R.R. was building the first railroad to the capitol in Jefferson City.  One of the major rivers the railroad had to cross was the Gasconade just west of Hermann.  So the railroad builds their mighty bridge and completes the track into Jefferson City.  Finally the day came to dedicate the railroad and start regular train service from St Louis to the capitol.  It just so happens that as the inaugural train is crossing the Gasconade River Bridge, it collapses into the river.  More than 29 lives are lost, along with a few engineers' careers too.  Kind of a prequel to the inaugural voyage of the Titanic.    So now I'm ready to leave Hermann after a nice visit, but before I do want to take a picture of the river and town.  There is a church on top of this nearby hill that overlooks the river.  As I get to the St Paul United Church of Christ to take my picture I have the first flat tire of the trip.  Fortunately it is the front one, which is a snap to change.  Since I'm in town and have a nice shady spot to work I decide to patch the old tube right away.   After patching the tire I use the church's bathroom to clean up.  When I get inside I meet Pastor James Elliott.  Now I am a son of a preacher and have a brother who is also a preacher and both serve the United Church of Christ.  Small world.  Wait it gets smaller.  Pastor Elliott knew my Dad years ago when both served churches in Illinois and knew that my preacher brother had served a church in Istanbul, Turkey.  We had a nice visit as I caught him up on the news that my father had retired and passed away years ago and that brother Greg now serves a church in North Miami, Florida.    Finally, I leave Hermann and get back on the KATY Trail.  It's noon, but I'm still full from brunch.  It will be another 22 miles without services, but I'm feeling fine just dawdling along the KATY Trail.  I finally meet another touring biker on the trail.  He is the first I've seen since Ed left.  He is towing a 17-pound Yakima trailer with his bike.  We discuss its pro's and con's for a while.  Personally, I am doing just fine with a couple of rear panniers and a full rear rack.  I wish I had a handlebar bag, but that just isn't practical on a recumbent with under seat steering.  I don't think I would enjoy pulling an extra 17 pounds either.  He is riding to Bluffton so I fill him in on the campground and thank him for clearing all the spider webs ahead for me.  I also warn him that there isn't a place between here and there to get a cold beer.  He smiles at me and says there is an icy cold six pack of St Louis freshest Budweiser on the trailer.  Hmm, maybe a trailer could fit behind 'Plum Crazy'. There is a beautiful 4-mile stretch of trail that runs right along the river just before the town of Treloar.  I found a nice spot to dawdle, smoked a cigar and took a few photos.    I must say I have not seen one commercial barge using the river that is lined with wood piling and rock wing dams.  The river does appear quite low, but the river towns don't have wharves and piers like I'm familiar with on the upper Mississippi River.  This is just an observation by this civil engineer without any real knowledge to back it up, but it seems the Corps of Engineers has spent billions developing this river for commercial use that isn't here. I roll into Treloar at 2:00 and spy a Bar with bikes out front.  I ride over expecting to dawdle over a couple of cold ones, but the bar won't open until 4:00.  I visit with a nice couple who have stopped to use the shaded beer garden for a picnic lunch before riding back to their car.  They keep offering me these healthy looking apples and grapes.  I keep refusing and keep thinking about those missed beers.    We part ways and I roll onto Marthasville.  Here I find an open bike shop and borrow his pump to 'top off' the tires.  I also find this frozen custard shop made out of a converted caboose.  How appropriate.  I dawdle over a strawberry sundae while visiting with the owner and ask about camping options in the area.  She says I can camp behind the caboose, but there are no showers.  I look the site over and decide I am not that desperate.  She does say the forecast is for rain tomorrow starting about midnight tonight.    I ride back over to the Bike Shop to ask about camping options.  He says the town lets people camp by their athletic fields, but I need to get permission first.  This site looks to be near a parking lot and would be lit by streetlights all night.  Also, it looks like they are getting ready for some kind of tractor pull or rodeo barrel races.  People keep telling me it's supposed to rain tonight.   I took a short ride outside of Marthasville to visit the supposed grave of Daniel Boone.  It seems after blazing a trail across the Appalachian Mountains, establishing Boonsboro, and fighting Indians in the Ohio River valley this American pioneer went bankrupt and was unwelcome in the country he established.  So, he left his country and moved his family to Missouri, which was part of Louisiana and under Spanish control.  The Spanish governor gave a land grant to Daniel Boone and he and his family began settling this area before long before Lewis & Clark.  When he lived here, it was the limit of white civilization.  Of course, Lewis & Clark came by and stopped for a visit.  It is said they bought some butter and vegetables, but no record is ever mentioned of meeting the legendary elder Boone.   The grave stone of Daniel Boone and the attached plaque seemed to be erected by the State of Kentucky.  I asked a local about that and he tells me that back in the late 1800's, the Kentuckians came into Missouri and dug up the body of Daniel Boone and his wife and moved them back to Frankfurt.  Local legend has it that they didn't get the actual Daniel Boone but instead one of his slaves.  The locals feel Daniel still rests somewhere on that knob just outside of Marthasville Missouri.    I decide to ride onto Dutzow and check on my options there.  Dutzow is a dud.  Yeah they have a nice deli where I got a decent sandwich, but their campground is worse than the two I just came from.  It sits in the middle of town behind the deli with an adjoining heavy traffic road.  They also assure me it's going to rain soon.  In fact it's starting to cloud up now That does it.  I wimp out and decide to spend the night in a motel in Washington, a town on the other side of the river.  I ride about 5 miles into and through Washington on some crowed urban roads.  It seems that Washington is close enough to St Louis to be a bedroom community.  In fact it's a pretty good size town of 20,000.  I check out three motels before settling on the appropriately named Lewis and Clark Motor Lodge.  I get a clean comfortable room for $55. I use the opportunity to sink wash my biking clothes.  Even though tomorrow I should be in St Peters and have access to my sister in laws laundry, I am tired of searching for the cleanest smelling dirty clothes.  I hang them up all around the room to dry and crank the air conditioner on.  My night is spent adding notes to the journal and watching the Olympics on TV.  I have cell phone service and call home to check-in and ahead to let Tammy know I'll be there tomorrow afternoon.  Tammy assures me it's forecast to rain tonight.  My wife thinks I am a wimp for sleeping in a motel too.  I sure hope it rains to make this worthwhile.
"
47,"I raid the motel's continental breakfast for a couple donuts and coffee and start to pack-up.  That is when I discover my rear tire is flat, my second flat in as many days.  At least I have a great place to repair it.  I find the smallest pin hole and patch it.  Instead of putting that tube, which now has three patches, back on the bike, I swap it for a new one. It's still raining at 8:00 so I get more coffee and a complimentary St Louis paper to read.  At 8:45 I leave before I go crazy.  It is really just drizzling by now.  I back track through town and the 5 miles of narrow two-lane without incident to get back to the KATY Trail in Dutzow.  Oh, there was that one incident with a guy who I thought was waving to me.  I couldn't clearly see through by rain splatter glasses until he was close that I was being flipped off.  Have a nice day to you too.    I found the trail wet, but not sloppy.  The two major wheel paths were muddy, but the center ridge was a little drier and rode just a little rougher.  I headed toward Augusta breaking spider webs every 100-ft or so.  This continued until I finally met two bikers coming toward me.  We both were glad to be done breaking through them.    When I reached Augusta at 10:30 the rain was coming down quite steadily.  The bike shop was of course closed that day for some remodeling.  I wanted to top of the tires, but I guess I'll have to wait.  I walk up the hill to the Cookie Jar café.  I am the only customer on this gloomy day.  There I meet Nick Barabik, the 70 year old owner and cook.  He fixes me a sausage & egg sandwich and we talk over coffee.  Nick filled me in on lots of local history and is my source for the local Daniel Boone legend. Across the street is the Augusta winery.  It is still raining so I shuffle over for some free wine tasting.  There I meet Nick's sister in law.  I am the only customer.  We visit and the more I talk about Nick and their quaint little town, the bigger she pours the samples in my glass.  I have gone through the entire list of wines and sampled my favorites a couple times.  I figure I have consumed about 3 glasses of wine while visiting.  Oh well, it's time to waddle on. I ride in the rain through the towns of Matson and Defiance.  I guess Defiance is where Daniel Boone actually lived, but I never saw any signs to get to his home so I rode on.  I did find an open bike shop and was able to fill my tires up all the way.  The little hand pump I have is easy to carry, but just can't seem to get them pumped to the 80 psi I like to ride with.   Back on the trail I pass through the Weldon Springs Conservation Area.  It's a swampy area, but is quite pretty to look at as I ride along.  I am able to come quite close to animals before they see me riding the trail alone in the rain.  I stop and watch three deer stand chest high in the water and feed on some sort of aquatic plant.  I also pass by Tavern Cave which is a place Lewis & Clark explored.  Nobody seems to know why they call it Tavern Cave except to speculate that it was a safe place to get out of the weather.  Hmm, now that sounds familiar.      I finally come to civilization near St Charles Missouri.  After riding on the KATY Trail for 150 miles, I will be leaving it and heading to my sister in laws home in St. Peters.  At the Page Avenue Extension Bridge I connect to a bike path that takes me up the bluff.      I ask a couple of times for directions and finally after six very hilly miles I roll into Tammy's house.  She is waiting and even made some welcoming sign which I didn't notice until the next day.  The first thing I do after a hug for Tammy was hose off my 'Plum Dirty' bike.      Inside I take a long hot shower, put on dry clothes, start my laundry and tell Tammy some of my adventures to date.  Soon my niece Nicki and nephew Matt come home from school.  Then the brother in law Steve arrives.  We talk a little about dinner plans and I soon find myself at a place that specializes in Buffalo wings.  We order 50 wings with 5 different kinds of sauce.  It's like a Chinese restaurant where everybody tries each others food.  It was fun.  Afterward I buy a 12-pack of beer so Steve and I can relax on the couch and enjoy a St Louis Cardinal Baseball game on TV.  They are having one of those special seasons.  We watch them come from behind yet again to beat the Pirates. About 10:30 p.m. I can't keep my eyes open and retire to sleep in a bed for the second night in a row.
"
48,"It was real foggy out this morning.   Before last night, my plans for today were to ride to Cahokia Mounds.  It is a World Heritage site near Collinsville, located about six miles east of the St Louis Arch.  I had hoped to travel most the way across town on bike paths to get to either the bike friendly Chain of Rocks Bridge or the Eads Bridge in downtown St. Louis.  I discussed my anticipated route with the in-laws and they make me realize I would have to ride through some pretty marginal neighborhoods.  After further consideration, I decided to pass on that trip and instead head to the Lewis & Clark museum in Hartford, Illinois and camp at the nearby Pierre Marquette State Park.   From Tammy's house I take a suggested less hilly route to the Page Avenue Bridge.  The closer to the river I get, the foggier it gets.  I decide to let some fog lift and duck into a Hardee's for some coffee.  30 minutes later it was a little better, but not much.  Soon I'm back at the bridge and this time I'm going to ride across the Missouri River on a separate Bike/Pedestrian lane.  Now that is what I call traveling in style.  A multi-million dollar investment just for us cyclists.   It is so foggy as I cross that I can hardly see the river flowing 100-ft below me, but I was safe from the traffic on the separate bike lane.  In fact there are lots of local riders out on this foggy Saturday morning.    Once I crossed the bridge I start riding on the shoulder of a 4-lane road in the Missouri River bottoms.  I will follow this road in a big circle towards Florissant Missouri.  The fog is thick, but traffic is light and I am quite safe on its nice wide shoulder.  Then I have another flat tire.  Of course it's the rear tire.  I rolled over a piece of beer bottle glass.  I thought that was ironically appropriate being in the St Louis area and the home to the King of Beers.   Instead of taking the extra time to patch the inner tube while sitting on the shoulder, I swap it out for the one with lots of patches.  One good thing about this delay is that the fog has lifted and it looks like it will be a wonderful clear and cool day for riding. Soon the Missouri bottomland ends and I ride through the rolling hills of Florissant on busy city streets.  It's riding where you can't get any rhythm going and you are constantly looking at the road surface for hazards and worry about traffic.  Fortunately on Saturday morning before 10:00 a.m. traffic is fairly light.  Soon I connect with the I-270 outer road.  I am lucky again because the outer road has been recently overlaid.  In my opinion there is no better riding surface than fresh smooth asphalt.  It makes me almost forget the noise of the adjoining interstate and the steep rolling hills.  No incidents occur and at 12:30 p.m. I am at the Chain of Rocks Bridge.    This bridge served as the legendary Route 66 Mississippi River crossing from 1928 to 1955.  Today it is only open to pedestrians and bikers.  The views of the Mississippi River and the St Louis skyline on this clear day are awesome.  It is another example of the major infrastructure provided for the bike/pedestrian in the Gateway City.  They seem to be developing interlinked community bike routes all over this area.  In a couple years I probably won't have to fear biking across town to visit the Cahokia Mounds.    After crossing the river into my home state of Illinois, I connect to another series of bike paths.  Some are smooth, some are rough, some are well marked and some are not.  These paths generally follow the tops of levee's with great views of the Mississippi River.  I cycle past a large Lock & Dam and now see river barges of all types working this river.   Soon I come to Fort DuBois State Park.  Here Illinois has a wonderful interpretive museum about the Lewis and Clark Corps of Discovery and the winter of 1803-04 they spent here preparing for their journey to the Pacific.  This also marked the end of my Lewis and Clark Bike Trail adventure.  There is a national bike trail designed and mapped by the Adventure Cycling Organization that starts at this site and follows the Lewis & Clark route all the way to the Pacific Ocean.  I know the first book I'll check out when I get home is Steven Ambrose's book on Lewis & Clark. The museum has a well-made movie that tells the story of their time here.  They also have a full-size cut-away model of the large keel boat they poled, pulled, sailed and rowed up the Missouri River.  Finally there is a recreated fort showing how they lived in the winter camp.  In the fort were re-enactors dressed in period costumes who answered the many questions from we visitors.  I was especially impressed by one knowledgeable gentleman and had my picture taken with him.     By now I was starving and ride to a roadside bar I've heard folk talk about for years.  That would be Fast Eddies.  It is located in Alton about a mile south of the US-67 Bridge on IL-3.  At 3:30 on this Saturday afternoon I can barely fit in the door.  The place is packed with a couple hundred people.  There is a two man band playing those sing-a-long rock classics to entertain us while we wait for our food and drinks.   I don't feel like drinking any booze.  I think I was a little dehydrated or hung-over from the beers last night.  I just wanted my food and a couple of sodas.  I order a really large soda.  The bartender tells me they only come in one size, which is really large.  However the price is also really large at $1.85 with no free refills.  Watch out if you stop here.  At Fast Eddies the food is cheap but the drinks are expensive! If my mood would have been different or I was with people I knew, I might have enjoyed myself more.  Instead I found it crowded, smokey, loud and crushed by way too many drunk people.  All I could think of as I rode away was that I was sharing this busy urban road with those same drunks for the next couple miles through Alton.     As I left I still had 25 miles to get to the Pierre Marquette State Park, fortunately most of those miles are on a separated bike path.  Unfortunately, this bike path was hilly and rough while the adjoining busy road looked to have a smooth, wide shoulder.    I finally get to the campground at 7:00 p.m. and quickly pitch my tent in the vicinity of a pit toilet.  Now there were plenty of empty camping spaces around to choose from, but I was too tired to try to find the perfect spot.  When I come back from my shower I realize that I have set-up 'downwind' of those pit toilets.  This won't do, so I drag my stuff inside my set-up tent to another ""upwind"" campsite.  Several neighboring campers must think I'm nuts dragging my gear all around, then stopping to sniff the air to see if it was safe.  I hope the wind doesn't change during the night. I take a walk over to the huge Lodge that this park is famous for.  It is a 'must stop' if you ever come to this park.  In fact on this weekend a music festival is being held there.  The main hall of the lodge is filled with about 200 people 'rocking out' to Dulcimer music.  I find in a large, overstuffed leather chair in a corner and scribble some journal notes while sipping Diet Pepsi and listening to the Great River Dulcimer Society's free concert.  I'll bet no one else here, but me, was also 'rocking out' at the Fast Eddies Roadhouse earlier today.  These Dulcimerites are a different breed of folk.  This small town boy fits in this crowd much better than the Fast Eddie crowd from this afternoon.  I must be getting old. Later, after the concert, these musicians breakout into informal jam sessions that 'rock-on' late into the night.  I get back to my tent to find 'Ranger Rick' waiting to collect my $10 camping fee.  After he leaves, I drop right off to sleep and don't wake until sunrise even though there are lots of other campers all around me.
"
49,"It's a beautiful day.  Mostly clear with a light south wind.  That's excellent news since I am traveling northwest.  I guesstimate that there will be 120 miles until I'm home in two days.  I've ridden that far on an empty bike before, but intend to camp in Pittsfield tonight.  That should put me about 50 miles from home. I leave the state park and back track a couple miles to ride the free Brussels Ferry across the Illinois River to get to Calhoun County.  Now I am enjoying those southerly tailwinds as I speed north along mostly flat roads.  Calhoun County is a long, hilly peninsula between the Illinois and Mississippi Rivers.  It is dotted with orchards on the hills and corn and soybean fields in the bottoms.  The local fruit stands area selling peaches and apples along with other produce.  Before I know it I am in the town of Brussels. I stop at a small market, which is the only store open on Sunday.  It's only open until noon so quite a few folk are stopping in to get their Sunday paper.  They have a little 'liar's table' set up in the back where the regulars drink coffee and I gossip.  I stop mainly because my front tire is going soft.  Instead of taking the time to change it,  I just pump it up.  It seems to be holding the air so I think try to ride on it and just stop to add air as needed.  This will probably put off the inevitable. While doing this I visit with Margaret, who lives a mile outside of Brussels and who walks to the store.  Margaret is a widow who has lived in Calhoun County her entire life.  I notice her throwing half the Sunday paper away.  She says why carry the parts she won't read back home.  I rescue the sports section to read over coffee later. After another 10 miles I come to Hardin.  I visit with a town deputy clocking speeders as I enter town.  I ask for the best spot to enjoy a cup of coffee.  He sends me to Mel's Illinois Riverfront Café.  Hardin sits right on the river and I have a nice view of the boat launching area.  Lots of folk are putting in there boats for a day on the river.  Here I read the salvaged sports section and answer questions about my trip from the waitresses.  Yes, it's true.  Everybody asks the same questions.  I should prepare a little handout for these situations, but then I wouldn't have the opportunity to play my personal version of twenty questions.  For every question they ask, I ask one about them.     Fifteen miles farther north along the Illinois River and I get to Kampsville.  They have a neat museum here on the local prehistoric Indians.  This is a center for archeology study because of the many local Indian mounds.  The museum is open, but I don't feel like stopping.  Instead I eat lunch at another riverside diner before continuing up along the Illinois River to the town of Pearl.   Pearl was named after the button industry that used the river oyster shell to make mother of pearl buttons 100 years ago.  Pearl also used to be known for a chicken processing plant.  When an interstate was built further north, that business closed down and relocated.  Now a river fish processing plant has taken it's place.  Playing my version of 20 questions with a convenience store clerk I find out that the fish plant employees twice the number of folk as the chicken plant did and sends frozen fish all over the world. It was at this convenience store I got a free soda.  I must have looked pretty bad, because as I walk in the store this motorcycle biker dude asks me if I want a soda.  He read my mind.  He tells the clerk I can have his and walks out of the store.  It seems he bought some hotdog meal that came with a soda that he couldn't use while riding his bike.  Thank you stranger. At Pearl I leave IL-100 and take the VinFiz blacktop highway to Nebo.  This county road is named in honor of the first transcontinental airplane flight around 1912 I think.  It flew this way and used that road and nearby railroad track to stay on its westward course.  The funny name was for the soda pop company who sponsored the flight.  I think the sign said it took 58 days for that first cross-country flight.  It would stop in many towns and give people their first close-up look at an airplane.   Just think a minute how far we've come.  When Lewis & Clark left to explore the Louisiana Purchase in 1804 they used boats, horses and feet to travel to the Pacific Ocean and back and took 3 years.  They traveled at the same rate as man had for thousands of years.  Then a few years later Robert Fulton used James Watt's steam engine to develop the first practical steamboat.  A few more years and the steam locomotive did the same thing for travel on land.  Now humans could travel and move products at 10 to 20 mph.  In 1903 the Wright brothers developed the airplane.  Others improved on the auto.  Today we criss-cross this country in hours not days.  All this improvement in the ability to move people and goods and here I am climbing over these hills averaging just about 10 mph.  I guess that makes me 'plum crazy' to travel this way. I stop in sleepy little Nebo looking for a soda.  This town is closed up tight on a Sunday afternoon.  I ask where a guy can get a soda and am sent to the Post Office to the only vending machine in town.  Yup, the town is that small.  Soon I am heading north to Pittsfield on a quiet and smooth country road.  Pittsfield is the county seat of Pike County, Illinois.  Pike County used to include all land between the Illinois and Mississippi Rivers from their junction to about 150 miles north.  This area was called the Bounty Lands and was made set aside for the veterans of the War of 1812. They were given the opportunity to get free land based on their rank and service during that war.  If you look close enough and you can still find reminders of those first pioneer farms. When I get to Pittsfield I am hot and tired.  The Nebo Blacktop enters town from the south and passes through a residential area.  To get to the central business district I have to run a gauntlet of 4-way stop signs.  I am looking for two things.  First are directions to the campground and second is a big ice cream sundae.  As I roll along I feel someone following me in a car.  I look back to find a local cop.  He pulls me over and before I can ask where the campground is, he is giving me a tongue lashing for rolling through a couple of 4-way stop signs.  He is right, that bikes need to obey the traffic rules the same as cars, but I did look and there was no other traffic and I was only going about 5 mph.  I kept my mouth shut but for an instance I thought I was going to get my first traffic ticket in 25 years.  Finally he sends me on with the verbal warning that he'll be watching me.   As I sit at a roadside stand enjoying that ice cream sundae if been dreaming of, who should come again by but my favorite cop.  We make eye contact.  No words are said but I can read his mind.  It said, 'What is he still doing in town?' and 'I better keep and eye on him.'   So now I'm off to the town campground that's 5 miles east of town.  When I get there it's nearly empty.  I about have the place to myself.  I set up in the tent camping area and go to the host's trailer to pay.  Nobody is home.  I figure that sooner or later this 'Ranger Rick' will come around to collect the $6 fee from me.  Why wait, so I go shower and head back to my site. Near sunset I see my favorite cop again as he patrols the city campground.  I had thought about sitting outside and reading my book, but find a lot of hungry mosquitoes want to visit with me.  The temperatures are rapidly cooling down so I duck into my tent and read by light stick until 11:00 p.m.  The host never came by so I suck in a free nights stay.   Oh yeah, I should mention I never changed that front tire.  I just top it off with air every couple hours and continued to roll on.  With continued good fortune and south winds I should get home around noon tomorrow.
"
50,"It was seven miles back to and through Pittsfield until I came to the Cardinal Café on the west edge of town.  I stopped for an average breakfast and headed back out.  Man, there are a lot of police in this town.  Besides a town police force, there is the county sheriff's and an attachment of Illinois State Troopers.  Everywhere I looked I saw cops.  I make sure and come to a complete stop and silently spell S-T-O-P before proceeding across the intersection. Back on the road, I decided this would not be a dawdle day.  Instead, I will push myself to get home before 2:00p.m.  The town of Barry is 20 miles down the road.  The state highway I am riding has light traffic and gives the biker a whole 1-foot shoulder to ride on.  The Illinois roads also seem flatter than Missouri.  IDOT seems to make some effort to level-off the hilltops. Before I know it I am in Barry.  The main town sits up on a hill and I am not going to dawdle today, so I roll right through and head for Kinderhook.  It's only a flat 6 miles to Kinderhook and they have a café called Fat Boys where I hope to stop for coffee.  Of course, when I get there the place is closed.  What is it about this trip and places I want to stop at?  I settle for a vending machine soda.  While drinking this soda in a shaded doorway and it starts to hit me that I've almost made it home. From here on, the roads are all familiar to me.  I soon come to my least favorite area road, a 10-mile stretch of an old (circa 1932) concrete pavement from an abandoned state highway near an interstate.  There aren't any alternatives to riding on this stretch of road.  I think the counties are in charge of maintenance but since so few travel on it, it is just left to deteriorate.  Every 40-feet there are rough joints.  They are so rough that last year I 'pinch-flatted' a tire on this road when I wasn't paying attention. I reach the end of this 'butt busting' road at the Fall Creek Conservation Area just off I-172 at IL-57.  I am now exactly 25-miles from home.  In a few miles I come into Marblehead where I find a vending machine at a private garage.  I sit and drink a soda while visiting with the mechanic/owner.  I know I am getting close to home when I don't need to explain where Ursa is and this guy knows people that I know. I ride north along the river through an industrial area of south Quincy.  It is very humid and the clouds are gathering.  I'm sure sometime this afternoon it will rain.  This is another reason to not hang around when I am this close to home.  Soon I'm rolling past the riverfront of Quincy.  They have a nice park on the Mississippi River with a fountain and places to watch the barges and river flow by.  It's one of my favorite places to dawdle when I ride to town.  Now I am exactly 12.5 miles from home.   The humidity is getting to me though.  I need a break.  Just 4-miles from home at the Rock Creek Bridge I stop and drink the last of my water.  When you're thirsty, even lukewarm water tastes good.  Those clouds are really building now.  If I don't hustle I will be riding in the rain.  Fortunately I have a decent tail wind.  This last 4-mile stretch is so familiar.  I know every driveway, fence post, culvert and every insignificant other thing on it.  I have run, biked, driven and hiked this road since I was a little kid. At exactly 2.25 miles from home I turn and climb the bluff and the last series of hills to our home.  Soon I come to the middle of Ursa.  Across the street is the café where I can be found most mornings at 6:00 a.m. drinking coffee and swapping gossip with the other local yokels.  Now I'm making that final right turn into the street that runs to our house.  I can see our home, but because this is Monday nobody is there.  The wife, Kim is at work and son, Luke is at school.  There is just one thought running through my mind as the wind picks up and the rain clouds get closer.  I hope they left the front door unlocked because I don't have any keys.  They did. Then it's done.  I step inside at 1:45 p.m.  A final check the odometer and see since I left Mandy & Justin's in Kansas City I've biked 544 miles in 8 days.  This averages a respectable 68 miles per day.  Now comes that fun task of unpacking, laundry, cleaning the bike and fixing two flat tires.  For the trip I had 5 flats.  The treads were pretty worn before I started, so before I do anything like this again I will need new tires and inner tubes.  At 2:00 p.m. it starts pouring rain outside. Yeah, I think I'll do this bike-touring thing again.  Maybe once a year I'll take a week and do this.  Its fun riding places you haven't been before.  It's interesting hearing other people's stories.  There's also the satisfaction of planning your trip and then seeing it through to the end.   While on this ride I would dream of other long bike trips I'd like to take.  I think riding across Kansas, west to east would be fun.  Or start in New Orleans and ride up the Mississippi River with stops in Natchez and Vicksburg.  Or leave Ursa and ride north along the Mississippi toward St Paul, Minnesota.  Or start in Fort Worth, Texas and ride north through Oklahoma on the Chisholm Trail.  Or start at the Rocky Mountains and head east across Colorado and Nebraska. So I think you might find me doing something like this again next year.  If I do, I'm sure I'll keep a journal, so this probably won't be the last word you get from the 'Ole Dougster riding 'Plum Crazy' across the old prairie.  So long for now and keep in touch.   "
51,"Why ride across America?  Lisa and I have dreamed of riding across the states for years.  I actually started out solo in Seattle in '82 after getting discharged from the Navy but didn't complete the trip.   We decided about a year ago to make this trip, following the old Transamerica route available from Adventure Cycling.  We figured that if we didn't do the trip soon, the girls would get older and we'd lose our chance to have them accompany us.  Of course they thought we were crazy when we first mentioned it, but after 6 to 8 months they finally came to realize the trip was inevitable.   For the past year I have been researching the route, using the Adventure Cycling maps and the book 'Bicycling Coast to Coast' by Donna Lynn Ikenberry.  We have also accumulated the additional gear we think we need to get across the states.  Lisa and I have managed to get a leave of absence from our employer so we can ride and still have a job to come back to.  Our projected departure date is May 24 from Yorktown, VA with a goal of reaching Florence, OR by the end of July.  The critical return date is August 10, which is the first day of the school year for the girls.  We probably won't know our exact departure date until a few weeks before we leave due to exam schedules. Why go east to west?  The main reason is that we have relatives in Oregon and can visit with them at the end of our trip.  Also, originally we had planned to have others riding with us and thought a train ride back east would be a good way to relax and ease back into our previous lives.   The reactions from friends, co-workers and family have been mixed.  Comments have ranged from 'are you taking a gun?' to 'wow, I wish I could go'.  Aron and Carry Buterbaugh, close friends from Maine, plan to join us for the first week of the trip.  None of our other cycling buddies are at a point in their life where a trip such as this is possible. One of our goals on this trip is to keep friends and family informed of our whereabouts and well-being.  That's why we chose to put our journal on this website plus the fact Neil's journal was the first one we found when we were researching the trip.  We plan to update the journal using Pocketmail and will let you know how that works for us.  We also plan to post photos but they will lag behind our journal entries.  Another goal is to have fun and enjoy our trip, so if we're a little slow posting entries it's because we're having a good time. Hope to see you on the road, Cliff, Lisa, Molly & Anna"

53,"Teamdavis arrived in Yorktown the night of May 22 and checked into the Marl Inn after a long day in a rented minivan.  The proprietors are very friendly and helped direct us to the airport.  We returned the rental to the Newport News/Williamsburg airport, leaving the girls at Yorktown to explore on bikes provided by the inn.  The taxis at the airport would not give us a ride because we had not flown in??  After finding out no buses served Yorktown from the airport we called the Yorktown Cab Co. and they gladly took our money.  After Aron & Carry arrived from Maine we once again made the trip to the airport and had great service once again from Yorktown Cab Co. Prior to going to the airport, we went down to the river/bay for a swim and Aron and Carry took photos as proof to their friends in Maine.  While they had a high temperature around 50 in Portland the day before, the temperature here has been well into the 80s. Yorktown was the site of the last major battle of the American Revolution.  Yorktown has many historic buildings still standing today.  The National Park Service provides interpretive tours and tour roads of the town and battlefields.  We didn't get a chance to take any tours but other guests at the inn found the tours they took to be both informative and enjoyable.
"
54,"The six of us started in Yorktown this morning, performing the ceremonial dip in the water with the rear wheel, then riding up to Victory Monument.  The route along the water and under the bridge could not be done due to road construction.  The Colonial Parkway from Yorktown to Williamsburg was pleasant. We toured around Williamsburg and ate lunch at Aromas (good coffee shop).  Later we rode out of town, once again on the Colonial Parkway.  We experienced a little less traffic on this leg of the trip.  Anna and Molly saw turtles and osprey all day.  The osprey are big and beautiful. We ended the day at Jamestown Beach Campground with a swim in the pool.  A game of Marco Polo was played until everyone was tired.  We picked out a nice site on a hill overlooking the James River.  Dinner was eaten on the beach below the campsite at sunset.  A group of six more cyclists showed shortly before dusk to set up camp.  They left Virginia Beach this morning and are taking our route to Colorado, then the express to San Francisco.  They're averaging 80 miles per day so it's unlikely we'll see them after tomorrow morning.  We experienced a lot of history today, a lot of which was about our fight for freedom from England.  We wish we had more time to see some of the parks and exhibits but we must move on.                         "
55,"We saw more osprey today, one with a sizable fish in its claws.  These are really magnificent birds.  Anna continues to log animals and scents of the day in her own journal.  We'll try to add comments from Anna and Molly when possible. Traffic today was heavy at the end of the day between Mechanicsille and the Americamps campground near Ashland.  We had quite a few dumptrucks pass us on Hwy 5 but they were all very courteous. We passed many battlefields today.  Yesterday was mostly Revolutionary War battlefields, whereas today was mostly Civil War period. The Americamps campground near Ashland was less than expected.  The tent sites were definitely an afterthought.  We ended up staying in a plywood cabin with A/C for the same price.   "
56,"Today's route was ridden by many farms in the Virginia countryside.  Patrick Henry's farm was one that was notable.  Also many churches along the way. Traffic was not bad until we neared the Christopher Run Campground.  We were trying to beat the traffic from the North Anna Nuclear Station but a few people seemed to be leaving early.  The campground was nice but a thunderstorm came in and we had to prepare and eat our supper under a gazebo.  The tents performed well, keeping us all dry. The smell today according to Anna was Magnolias.  We saw turtles, rabbits and turkeys along the route.         "
57,"Many vineyards along the way today but no stops for tasting.  The Jefferson Vineyard outside Charlottesville seemed to be the most commercialized. Last night's rain started again early this morning and delayed our start, but the roads were dry by the time we were packed and ready to hit the road. We traveled to the town of Mineral for breakfast and discovered that the camping spot behind the fire department was already taken by the fair.  Good choice to stay at Christopher Run last night.  Aron and Carry left for the Charlottesville airport after breakfast.  They needed to return to Portland before Monday.  We will really miss their company. Today's ride was filled once again with beautiful Virginia countryside.  Traffic was no problem until the last 3 miles on Hwy 53 entering Charlottesville.  Tonight we splurge and get a hotel room in the historic district downtown.  Molly and Anna get treated to 2 swimming pools and some television.     "
58,"June Curry, the 'Cookie Lady' is a fantastic woman.  We stopped by her house in Afton in the afternoon on our way up to the Blue Ridge Parkway.  We got a tour of the house and it almost brings tears to your eyes to hear her tell you about the history of her home.  June has been assisting cyclists for 29 years on their journies across the country.  We can't begin to describe her house and its memorabilia.  She's hosted travelers from all over the world.  We spent enough time with her that we had to change our destination today.  We ended up not having enough time to make it down the parkway. Once again it was raining when we woke up, so we found a CVS pharmacy and picked up a few supplies.  By the time we hit the road it was dry.   Heading out of Charlottesville was exciting as we were mistakenly routed out onto the 520 Bypass and spent 5 miles with high speed commuters.  Thankfully, a shoulder existed to keep us out of everyone's path.  We did experience our first flat from a shard of glass most likely picked up on the bypass shoulder. Wyant's Store was our lunch stop.  The owner had a lot of baseball decorations in the store and had a son that had made it to the minor leagues.  He was pleasant to talk to.   The climb to the Blue Ridge Parkway was pretty good, requiring both tandems to use granny gears.                               "
59,"We left Rockfish Gap and headed for Lexington on one of the prettiest days we've ever ridden on the Blue Ridge Parkway.  The girls put on vests at the start due to the cool morning breeze.  It probably didn't reach 75 degrees while we were on the parkway and the haze didn't obstruct too much of the views.  We saw quite a few local cyclists on the parkway and chatted with some English cyclist we met at an overlook.   It was quite a ride with the loaded bikes and trailer in tow.  We managed to stay out of the granny gears but there was a lot of climbing.  The true test for the tandems was the downhill on 56 into Vesuvius.  The girls managed the drag brakes very well.  Molly and Cliff, with trailer in tow, did have to stop and allow rims to cool after a couple of miles.  The disc brake couldn't take the harshness of the descent as well as the drum brake, but got them safely down.   When we arrived in Vesuvius the town seemed desserted.  There was a sign for Gertie's (without mileage) in the opposite direction that we needed to go but we were hungry and decided to chance it.  When we entered the store Gertie asked what had taken us so long.  We stared at her with blank faces until she explained that 6 guys headed for California had stayed the previous night and left us a note.  Gertie has all transamerica cyclists write their names, home town and date on the ceiling of the store.  Cliff had to hoist Anna to his shoulders and have her write the info.  There's barely any room left on the ceiling and the walls are already filled up. Most of the dates we looked at were from 2000 forward.  Gertie also gave us her email address so we can let her know when we finish. Traffic today was very light on the whole route.  Lexington is having a big horse show but traffic in town was not a challenge.                   "
60,"Lexington is a town with 2 small colleges, Washington and Lee and VMI.  The older part of town was very pretty with decorated porches and manicured lawns.  It didn't stop when we headed out of town.  Most houses had nice porches and yards.  A lot were along the creeks and river we followed through the valleys. We ate lunch in the little town of Buchanon.  The downtown area was set along the James River in front of a rock cliff.  The homemade bread was especially good.   Traffic was very light all day long, even on the 4 lane US Hwy 11 entering Troutville.  We met some local cyclist from Roanoke and rode about 15 miles with them.  They helped a great deal with determining lodging available further along the route.  We had intended to ride an additional 20 miles but there was no camping, motels or food available along that part. Anna as become our celebrity cyclist after losing one of her cycling gloves a couple of days ago.  She is the 'Michael Jackson' of cycling as she continues to wear the single glove.  She has also found out she can switch hands by turning it inside out.       "
61,"Today was a lot of ups and downs with a stiff headwind to boot.  We awoke to raindrops and waited a little while to hit the road. The wait was worth it as the rain stopped but the headwind which blew it out also blew in our face all day. Lunch was at the community of Catawba at the only store on the first 40 miles of the route.  We had to wait half a hour for the cook to return with groceries but it was worth it.  Some AT hikers had also come off the trail to get supplies and use the phone. The climb into Christiansburg seemed like it would never end.  Worse was the climb up the hill on Main after turning off Depot St.  Cliff couldn't remember the way around it so we walked up it.  A masochist must have put that hill on the route.  Traffic was very light the whole day and the scenery continued to be beautiful. Crown Vetch was the flower of the day. Just a reminder.  Today was Memorial Day and we saw a lot of flags flying at cemeteries.  Earlier in the week we passed a cemetery in the country with a new grave of a soldier from the war.

 "
62,"Seemed like we were on the interstate most of the day as we had to travel on frontage roads next to I-81.  We missed our first turn today after crossing the New River when leaving Radford.  All were on the lookout but the turn was still missed.  We eventually picked up the route again about 15 miles further. Passed through Draper and the New River Trail.  After leaving Draper we struggled up a grueling hill only to have the most beautiful view of the church and valley below.   After reaching Wytheville, we decided it would be best to catch up on laundry and grab dinner before heading to the Rural Retreat Lake and Campground.  Left CJ's Pizza at 7:10 with a box of leftovers strapped on the trailer and headed to the campground.  We were being chased by darkness and a dark cloud and reached camp at 8:20 just before it started to rain.  Everyone did a great job as we belched our way through the countryside. Showers were cold water.  We could have sworn the brochure said warm showers?  We ate cold pizza before retiring. Traffic was very light today and the road conditions were good.  The wind continued to punish us as it blew in our face all day. The smell today was privet.       "
63,Left out of Rural Retreat Campground headed for brunch in Sugar Branch.  Once again we were greeted with a very stiff headwind.  One noticeable observation along the way to brunch was a small farm pond with a duck house.  It was a modified dog house sitting at water's edge. The little cafe in Sugar Branch served us breakfast even though it was past  10:30. The dessert menu was bigger than the regular menu so we all had dessert since we would skip lunch on our way to Damascus. After finishing brunch we were surprised when a friend from nearby Chilhowie saw our tandems parked outside and came in to checkout the riders.  We didn't realize how close we were to our friends Ed and Jane Larimer.  Jane was on her way to work when she saw the bikes and stopped in.  Ed joined us on one of the mountain climbs later on his motorcycle. They drove over  to Damascus later and had supper with us. The ride to Damascus was very beautiful even though we climbed a good bit. At least while we were climbing we were protected from the unrelenting headwind.  The last 10 miles was a coast into town. We bought more than we needed at the bike shop in Damascus and will have to send a few items home tomorrow.  Anna bought a new pair of gloves and has dropped from her earlier celebrity status. We decided to stay in the Montgomery Homestead B&B and had the entire house to ourselves.  The owners are very nice. The smells today were wild roses and the 'wild smell'. You have to have been a frequent rider with Cliff and Lisa in the Carolina mountains to understand the wild smell.           
64,"Today was a short ride to give us time to pick up mail and rest up a little.  We wanted to split the next 2 days up to get to Kentucky without killing ourselves.  Hayter's Gap was a bear of a climb, 3.7 miles that felt like 3.8.   Fire Pink was the flower of the day and they were present at the gap.  Lots of farm smells, not all that pleasant when breathing hard up a hill. The scenery was beautiful once again.  We crossed different branches of the Holston River several times and many farms along the way.  Traffic was pretty light and made it even more enjoyable. We did laundry in Damascus before heading to Elk Garden Hostel.  Anna fed the juke box and livened up the place by playing AC/DC's Black is Back.  She had also entertained the crowd at dinner last night with the same tune.   We sleep in the Elk Garden United Methodist Church Hostel tonight.  What generosity this little church has.  We're actually going to sleep on the altar tonight but don't expect any major changes.  We packed food for supper but there was a supply available in the kitchen.   We had company, Beau Anderson from Sonoma, CA at the hostel.  He's travelling solo and also plans to head for Breaks Interstate Park tomorrow.             "
65,Left the Elk Garden Hostel in a light drizzle and rode 3 miles to Becky's for breakfast.  Good food.  Becky's is run by men and named after their 7 year old neice.   The rain let up for the next 8 miles and then the sky opened up on us in Honaker.  We stayed put until it eased up then rode the rest of the way rain-free. We met an interesting person in Honaker named David Artrip.  He lives on Big 'A' mountain and has been watching cyclists come and go since he was a teenager.  We now have his address and have promised to send postcards as we travel on.  David said he has a place among his NASCAR memorabilia especially for cyclist.  Nice to know us cyclists rank that high with some. Lisa and Anna have decided the flower of the day is daisies.  Saw a lot of rock cliffs and waterfalls along the route as we neared the Cumberland Plateau.  No noticeable smell. Traffic was light enough except coal trucks near Haysi.  They were very polite as they went back and forth over the mountain we had to climb.   We pulled into Breaks Interstate Park and found the campground pretty saturated from the abnormal amounts of rain the VA mountains have been getting.  Electricity was temporarily out so we filled up at the buffet until it was restored then got a room. Beau rode with us today and also got a room at the park.  Anna entertained him with conversation about turtles we saw along the road and a crow pretending to be a buzzard.  She also showed him what a dead groundhog looked like (he thought it was a beaver).  Beau didn't fall for Anna's dead opossum saying; he'll be playing 'possum for the rest of his life. We're all excited about getting into Kentucky tomorrow.  We'll have over 600 miles and 1 state under our belts.   
66,"We left the Break's in the clouds and mist and rolled into Kentucky.  The mountains were still there as we had to tackle 3 pretty tough climbs throughout the day.  The downhill ride into Kentucky was great. Molly and Anna armed themselves with HALT for the dreaded dogs of Kentucky.  Anna's aim proved true as she stopped 4 dogs in their tracks.  For the most part dogs weren't that much of a problem. Daylillies were the flowers of the day as they were along all 3 mountain climbs.  No distinctive smell. The litter along the roadsides was much more prevalent in Kentucky today.  We believe we saw more today than the entire time we were in Virginia.  It's a shame what people  will do to their own environment. There were but a few coal trucks on the road today and they were along the stretch of 4 lane highway we rode.  Hopefully we'll get out of coal country before the first of next week.   Our second flat of the trip was a pinch flat on the back of Lisa's tandem along the 4 lane portion of highway.  She was instructed by the mechanic not to follow so closely so she would have ample time to avoid the bigger rocks and pieces of debris. Pippa Passes is a unique little community. It is the home of Alice Lloyd College, a teacher's school with about 600 students.  The hostel is provided by Ed and Charlotte Madden.  Various parts of the house are used for the hostel.  We will sleep in the basement.       "
67,"How many hills today?  We kept asking at stores along the way and we got as many answers.  There were several steep mountain climbs today and several big hills in between.  The anticipation of getting out of the mountains and riding some flatter terrain was killing all of us. The ride was beautiful, along creeks and rivers.  Except for the mountain climbs there's always a rock cliff on one side of the road and water on the other.  We had one scare when we came up to a sign that stated 'high water'.  The alternative didn't look very good. All of the loose dogs were pretty well behaved today.  Anna didn't get to use her HALT at all.  Besides the usual dogs we saw several baby horses.  The flower today was once again the daylily.   We camp tonight with Beau at the Presbyterian Church in Boonesville.  They have a grassy area behind the church and a small pavilion with shower(cold) and port-o-let.  They don't even charge a fee.  Tomorrow's destination is Berea.     "
68,"We took the short-cut across Murphy's Ford today and had visions of donning sandals and carrying bikes across Red Lick Creek, but when we got to the ford we were disappointed to find a bridge.  It was shaded and made a very good place to take a break anyway. We may have finally put the worst of the mountains behind us today.  The ride climbed out of Booneville and went into a pleasant valley before climbing onto a ridge with some short frog-strangling hills.  The remainder of the ride wasn't flat but was much easier.  There was very little traffic and that made the ride very pleasant.  There were no services available after the first 14 miles so we carried extra food and stopped at the Red Lick Baptist Church for water.  A lady setting up for a birthday party told Anna of a swinging bridge she could walk on.  We later stopped and let her walk out to the creek. The flower today was the Thistle.  They were abundant alongside the road, especially where there were pastures.  Once we dropped off the last mountain we saw many horses, some with young ones. We missed having Beau with us today.  He needed to stop at the Post Office and left Booneville after us.  We did not see him until later in Berea.  We said goodbyes as he will be taking a rest day tomorrow to get some repairs done to his bike.       "
69,"We took a vote and decided that Berea would make a good rest day.  We enjoyed the many craft shops and the college's swimming pool.  Everybody caught up on writing letters and postcards.  We also met another transam cyclist, a single woman from Eugene, Oregon.  Tomorrow we should be back on the road.                   "
70,"We finally left Berea today but not until we visited the Kentucky Artisan Center located near I-75.  It's located at the northernmost Berea exit.  They have anything from 50 cent postcards to $800 wooden hats, and more.  And best of all, Anna was able to taste the gravy biscuits at the cafe.  For those keeping up with this important fact, the truckstop at Ashland, VA still has the lead for gravy biscuits. Today's scenery was very nice and traffic was low.  The Kentucky countryside today was great.  We took a break at a country store in Kirksville today and the people were so nice we spent an hour talking.  They requested that we send them some elk antlers from out west if we run across some.  They also told us where we would pass by a cemetery with a guitar for a headstone and a dog at the foot of the grave.  It's the grave of the father of John Michael Montgomery.  The dog looks real until you're upon it. We stopped at a marina on Lake Harrington for lunch.  The entire marina is built on a huge floating dock on the lake.  Food was great and once again the conversation was too. Cliff's tandem today had a blowout on the rear.  The sidewall blew out and the spare had to be put into use.  There is supposed to be a bike shop in Bardstown tomorrow so, hopefully, extra tires and tube may be picked up. The flower today was the Trumpet Vine.  The heat and humidity are back up since we left the mountains.  Also, saw several farms for sale today supposedly due to losing their tobacco allotments.                   "
71,"We visited the Lincoln Homestead State Park and took some photos at a  house that Abe's oldest son built and lived in.  There was a golf course at the state park and the road curved around and through both.  It was a nice quiet spot. We actually got an early start and reached Bardstown by 1:00 to get another tire from the bike shop in town.  They had none that were the correct size so we went off route to the town of Elizabethtown to another shop.  If we hadn't gone to Elizabethtown the next opportunity would have been Carbondale, IL.  That would have been too risky.   The girls hung in and we made the 81 miles before the shop closed.  The owner has 10 and 16 year old girls and was envious of us trying this trip.  We'll be back on route tomorrow and camp at Rough River Dam State Park. Today's flower was the Mountain Viburnum.  We saw a lot of them along the route in the morning.  We noticed a lot of dead birds on the road, even a hawk.  Seems a lot of birds get hit by cars and trucks. Most people we meet along the way are interested in our trip and ask many questions.  Lisa and Cliff always tell people that it was the girls idea to do the trip.  You should see their eyes roll.     "
72,"Today's ride was a little disappointing in two ways.  We were supposed to pick up a package at the Mc Daniels post office but all post offices were closed for the mourning of Ronald Reagan.  Since our overnight stop was 6 or 7 miles past Mc Daniels we camped closer to Mc Daniels.  The lake at the campground is 18 feet above normal so half the campsites are under water and no swimming is allowed.  Bummer. The day's ride was good with the exception of coming out of Elizabethtown on US 62.  Traffic wasn't real bad but it was nice to get off onto more peaceful roads.   The most eventful thing today was setting the watch back an hour when we crossed into the Central time zone.  It happened on the biggest hill of the day near Hardin Springs, KY. The flowers today were Blackeyed Susans, Butterfly Bush and Queen Ann Lace.  Lisa and Anna had too many to choose from. Anna had her biscuits and gravy at a Mc Donalds today but the Ashland, VA truckstop still has the best for this trip.  Sooner or later those gravy biscuits are going to run out and Anna will have to change her diet."
73,"What a humid night at Axtel Campground.  We had to remove the fly from the tent to keep from sleeping in a total sauna.  We awoke at 5:30 to the rumble of thunder and quickly broke camp.  Before we could walk down to the highway the first storm hit us but we managed to escape from the rain under our plastic sheet.  We ate breakfast at a cafe outside the campground and made it to the post office at 9:00 just in time to miss the second storm. The wait for the post office was worth it as we received our pre-packaged supplies and cookies and peppermints from Lois and Herb (thank you).  Molly also received a letter from a friend. We made the ride to Utica but had to stop at the Sand Knob Sweet Shoppe for a donut.  We had seen signs for 10 miles and couldn't resist any longer.  Shortly after our donut stop we got hit with a thunderstorm that we couldn't outrun to cover and rode in rain most of the day.  A tornado warning was issued in the Rough River area right after we left it.  We could see the dark swirling clouds just to the east of us. We ate lunch at 'The Diner' in Fordsville and returned to the rainy roads afterwards.  Outside Oklahoma, KY we came across a most unusual piece of metal sculpture in a field beside the road.  Don't know what it represented. The flower today was the Mimosa.  The Mimosa trees were full of blooms.  Daylillies were a close second. The Utica Fire Department is a great place.  A clerk at the local gas station saw us an gave directions.  All the comforts of home; a microwave, refrigerator, bathroom with shower and cable TV.  We also had a whole fleet of emergency vehicles at our disposal.  The chief said we had the run of the place but not to hang laundry on the firetrucks. A note about the area we've been riding through.  The Rough River Lake lies within the ""Clifty"" area of the Pennyroyal Region of Kentucky.  The Clifty area comprises the western edge of the Pennyroyal region and was carved by streams through alternating layers of sandstone, shale and limestone.  We apologize for getting so factual but wanted to remember something about the geology of the area.         "
74,"Today completes our second state, the state of Kentucky.  We entered Illinois by ferry across the Ohio River after riding 84 miles through western Kentucky.  We rode in rain part of the day but it was a welcome relief from the high temperatures and humidity. We saw more deer today than we have seen the whole time we've been in Kentucky.  Cliff and Molly noticed two of them standing next to a trampoline in a yard.  The dogs were barking at Cliff and Molly and didn't even notice the deer. Another animal adventure occured when Lisa and Anna scared a buzzard off some roadkill.  The buzzard flew a tight circle, passing directly over their heads.  They let out a scream and sprinted away on their tandem. The flowers of the day were Butterfly Weed, Milkweed, Blackeyed Susans and Daylillies.  There were many many flowers today. While exploring the cave at Cave in Rock, a Baltimore Oriole nest was found with babies and mother and father feeding them.  That was much nicer than what history has to say about what happened in that cave.  The cave was used for pirates to operate out of. While waiting at the ferry we were talking of leaving the dreaded dogs of Kentucky and trading in our pepper spray for something more useful to us when a dog in a truck about 3 cars back saw us and started barking his head off.  Later on the ferry ride Anna made her way over to the truck and made friends with the pooch.  It may have been that he was an Illinois dog after all.                     "
75,"After leaving Cave in Rock State Park we rode 10 miles to the little town of Elizabethtown, IL, to eat breakfast.  We finally rolled into Goreville, just outside Fern Cliff State Park, at 3:30 for lunch.  There really weren't any places to eat lunch so we snacked most of the day.  We had lunch at Dad's Pizza.  They had an old sign outside of town advertising their food and the dsitance to Eugene, OR, 2500 miles.  We still have a ways to go. Today's ride was like a roller coaster that wouldn't quit.  You would think that Illinois was flat with endless farms but the southern part is fairly hilly.  We rode through some of the Shawnee National Forest today. Today's flowers were milkweed and purple clover.  Illinois likes to mow their roadsides and a lot of flowers were not present.         "
76,"About 8 miles out of Goreville we encountered a ""Bridge Out, 3.5 miles"" sign.  Decision time; do we take a chance that we can cross the creek or river, or find an alternate route.  After talking to 2 drivers passing by we decided to take their advice and go around the area.  They neglected to tell us about the 4 miles of gravel, but we eventually made it through. We went off route and into Carbondale, Il, for some bike parts.  We checked 2 of the 3 shops in town and found all of the parts we needed.  We visited the famous shop ""Bike Surgeon"", which is under new management.   We ate lunch at Quatro's Pizza in Carbondale.  The owner was interested in where we were from and our destination.  He gave all four of us free t-shirts.  He started his place the same year the Trans Am route started, 1976.  Even though he was off route, cyclists would come to town and end up eating at his place and that kept him in business through the summers when the college students were away.  We took the t-shirts even though we didn't need the weight. About 3 hours after leaving the bike shops, Cliff's rear brake started making noise and was diagnosed with a missing nut.  He tie-wrapped it out of the way and made the remaining 30 miles. As we were nearing Chester, home of Popeye's creator, we were descending a steep hill and two combines that extended out to both ditches were coming up the same hill.  We had to abandon the bikes and run off the road to avoid the machines.  They looked like big green people eaters. Today's flower was Sweet White  Clover.  The farmers were harvesting wheat and once again we saw many deer.       "
77,"Left Chester after taking photos of Popeye and crew.  They have a statue near the bridge crossing the Mississippi River commemorating Popeye's creator, . The river crossing was shorter than the Ohio River crossing we made two days earlier into Illinois.  Wow, two days and we were out of Illinois and into our new state of Missouri.  Met the Pedal Prayer cyclist today in St. Mary, MO.  He was headed to Perryville and had not come across any cyclists for a while.  The store clerk informed us of other cross country cyclists that had stopped by in the last week or two.  We're still behind a few we have only heard or read about from journals at some of our overnight stops.  We don't know where Beau is but hope he is still on the road and safe. Today's route didn't have a good lunch stop but we lucked out and found a vineyard at Coffman.  They had a good deli and a big porch out back to eat on.  We watched bison, llamas, oreo cows and ducks while eating lunch.  Lisa and Cliff skipped the wine tasting as they didn't have overnight facilities. So far the unkind Missouri motorists we have heard about haven't shown themselves.  All have been patient and courteous.  It's not really the motorist or cyclist that is at fault, it's the nature of the terrain and roads.  Roads have no shoulders and curves around the many bluffs don't give much advance notice of a slow cyclist ahead.  We're talking to locals and planning our departures and arrivals to avoid heavier traffic. Today's flower was Queen Anne's Lace.  We were warned by other cyclists of the large amount of road kill we would see while in Missouri and they were right.  Even the buzzards are fair game. A note to other transam cyclists, the Mineral Area Cycle shop on N. Jefferson at the court square is very helpful and humorous.  He found a Campy nut for Cliff's rear brake and he now is back to two brakes working.  Molly could be heard screaming down some descents yesterday and today as Cliff tried controlling the speed with just his front brake and the trailer pushing them forward.                       "
78,"We are going a little off route and off our schedule the next few days.  We decided to see some sites off route like Elephant Rock State Park.  For those that have our itinerary, it will look different. We stopped by Elephant Rock State Park today to see the huge rocks and remains of the quarry operation that once went on there.  The rocks are pink granite and some weigh over 500 to 600 tons. Johnson's Shut-ins State Park was our next stop.  Missouri State Parks are free, by the way.  Shut-ins park has a river flowing through it and some really neat holes to swim in. Roads today had pretty good surfaces and there was more traffic but not too bad. Flower of the day was the Black-eyed Susan.  Road kill of the day was opposum.                                 "
79,"Had to go off route for a couple of reasons.  Got our mail in Hartville.  We think we're finally out of the worst of the Missouri hills.  We stopped at the Clare C Market in Ash Grove today.  You have to talk to Tommy and Leanna at the store.  They're chock full of the area's history.  Ash Grove is home to Nathan Boone, Daniel Boone's youngest son.  Tommy also showed us how to ski, Missouri style. Got to Golden City in time to have a slice of pie at Cooky's and read some email at the library.  We had made arrangements to stay in the hostel and it turned out to be pretty nice.  For $15 you get a bed with clean linens and fresh towels, use of the house with its washer and dryer as well as TV and stereo.   We went back to Cooky's for dinner and had to wait a few minutes for a seat.  Cooky's is well known for their pies but they also raise a lot of their meat and vegetables.  Golden City has a population of about 2 or 300 and I think they fed twice that many tonight.  We talked to people 40 miles away who knew of Cooky's. Another cross-country cyclist showed up at the hostel.  Joel is from Maryland and started in Utah and is headed home.   The flower of the day was the yellow cactus.  Road kill was the armadillo, or 'possum on the half shell as we saw them.               "
80,"We ate breakfast at Cooky's before heading out of Golden City.  The pancakes Cliff ordered couldn't be finished.  We met some local cyclists about 15 miles out from Golden City.  They were on their way to Cooky's to have breakfast. Only a few minor hills separated us from Kansas.  We saw bison and llamas before leaving Missouri.  They were in pastures next to the highway.  After entering the wheat state we stopped at a coffee shop in Pittsburg, KS.  A woman was giving free massages so the whole team was treated. Met a couple from California riding tandem from Pueblo, CO to Freeport, ME (we gave them Aron and Carry's phone number in case they need help).  Also met another eastbound cyclist from New Zealand.  We all traded information.  We found out that a bridge detour ahead is no longer required which is great after the last detour we encountered. Flower of the day was the Moth Mullin.  Tommy from Ash Grove had told us that early surveyors used the stalks for staffs.  There are too many wild flowers along the Kansas roadways and our resident expert, Lisa, is having trouble identifying most since they are not indigenous to South Carolina.  We might have to start identifying road kill instead of flowers. Molly and Anna did great riding 96 miles today.  We believe it qualifies them for a century, especially since we were loaded down with gear.  We may try to alter the length of our days to give them a break.           "
81,"We entered the Flint Hill area of Kansas today.  Locals were warning us of big hills but they never materialized.  The locals don't realize how their hills compare to what we've already seen.  Actually, it was nice to have some interruptions in the flat terrain. Met a couple of cyclists out for a 2 or 3 weeklong tour.  They were from Utah but one had family in Kansas.  Everytime we meet other cyclists we always stop to chat and trade stories.  We should start seeing more and more as we get further west. We stopped in downtown Toronto for lunch.  Only one place was open, Courtney's Place.  Toronto was another of those little towns that is mostly ghost town.  Courtney's made Molly and Anna pizzas to order and served ""homemade"" pasta and sauteed spinach to Lisa and Cliff.  It was the best meal of the trip and was in the middle of nowhere.  Great. Not only did we see dead armidillos today but we saw three young ones eating alongside the road.         "
82,"Anna tried the gravy biscuits at Red's in Eureka this morning and they didn't displace the first place Ashland, VA truckstop.  They were delicious but not quite as good. The highway out of Eureka was quite pleasant but when we turned onto Rosalia Rd and headed to Casaday it was a whole different story.  The road surface had craters and rough patches all over.  Molly's seatpost bolt holding the seat rails broke and Cliff had to borrow a bolt from a signpost to make repairs(thanks to Kansas DOT).  The flowers, birds and wild horses made up for it though.  The government has placed a large number of mustangs in pastures adjacent to the road.  Molly was thrilled.  A man in the cafe at Rosalia had told us of the mustangs. Before Rosalia Rd we stopped in the cafe in Rosalia for a snack and ended up eating lunch.  One of the women working there had two girls the same age as Molly and Anna and we got to meet them before leaving.  Rosalia was another one of those ghost towns but it had died out due to a big fire that almost destroyed the whole town.  The women at the cafe showed us a book about the town with pictures pre-dating the big fire. We saw Indigo Buntings and Scissor Tails and a few deer.  The flower today was the milkweed. The terrain wasn't flat but also wasn't very hilly.  We think we're through the Flint Hills and heading for the prairie.  We're on the lookout for a Prairie Chicken.                 "
83,"Today was a short day so that we could visit the Kauffman Museum.  We stopped at the museum on our way out of town and it proved to be well worth it.  Mr. Kauffman even had a collection of old bicycles and automobiles in the back of the museum.  There were also many other artifacts that didn't pertain to Kansas that were interesting. Met a couple of English cyclists today that were headed east.  They were in need of a pedal and were going to try to find one in Newton.  We gave them a wooden nickel from the store in Walnut, KS so they could get a discount.  The store had given each of us a coin to give to eastbound cyclists in order to entice them to stop.  We have three remaining. Buhler turned out to be a very friendly town and we ate a late lunch at the Mustard Seed.  They had good food and excellent coffee (according to Cliff). We ended up getting a deal at the B & B, Nine Gables, and stayed the night.  Dinner was at Joey's Diner.  Buhler also had a very nice pool, free to cyclists. The flower today was the Alfalfa. There's plenty of it around this part of Kansas.           "
84,"Today started out great with a breakfast at Nine Gables B&B.  Emma prepared a great breakfast and we were underway early for today's ride.   Since the last 60 miles of today's ride would not have any stores, cafes or gas stations, we rode 20 miles to Nickerson and shopped for lunch.  The further west we go the fewer trees we see and less shade.  Lunch was roadside and then we got more water at an artesian well about 45 miles into the ride. With about 25 miles to go we came aross Peace Church and it had some huge shade trees with grass underneath.  The whole family layed down in the church yard and had a nice 30 minute nap. Larned has a couple of cattle stock yards just east of town.  We now appreciate the chicken farms and paper mills we have at home.     Today's flower was the sunflower.  They were all alongside the road as well as cultivated sunflowers in fields. NEWSFLASH  Anna had gravy biscuits for supper at Don Do's in Larned and they have now knocked off the Ashland, VA truckstop for the best.         "
85,"Anna started her day with gravy biscuits once again.  The smell from the stockyard seemed to have calmed down some during the night.  We got to our lunch stop before 10:00 and had to wait a few minutes for them to open.   Lunch stop was a bar with NASCAR posters covering all the windows.  It was kind of dark at first until the eyes adjusted, but it was clean, had a kid's menu and even a couple of booster seats.  Not to bad for a bar.  The only other choice was another bar with pizza but it didn't open until 11:00. It was a fairly uneventful day.  The most unusual thing was a rest stop on Hwy 96 in the middle of nowhere.  It was air conditioned and sported some rather nice stainless steel toilets! We checked into the Bicycle Oasis in Bacine, run by Elaine and Dan Johnson.  They have 3 golden retrievers and 1 black lab.  Dan took Molly and Anna along when he took the dogs for a run.  Elaine arranged a massage for Cliff due to a sore left thigh.  Anna tagged along and got a free massage as well. Elaine fixed a very hearty supper after we finished laundry.  Home made bread was also served.  Dan topped things off with root beer floats for all.   Today's flower was Sneezeweed.  Lisa and Anna spotted three badgers alongside the highway too.             "
86,"We got a later start than normal due to our hosts at the Bicycle Oasis in Bacine.  It was like saying goodbye to family.  It was 52 degrees when we woke up.  Unusually cold for this time of year in Kansas.  We all donnned rain jackets for the first 10 miles to stay warm and headed west once again. Before our lunch stop in Dighton, we met two other couples, each riding tandems.  One couple from California heading for Maine and the other couple from New York heading for Yorktown, VA.  We stopped for our usual lengthy chat and got behind schedule. Our mail pickup in Scott City had to happen by the time the post office closed at 4:00.  Lisa and Anna put the metal to the pedal and made the last 26 miles in time to get the mail. We would have had to wait until 9:30 tomorrow to get mail. We checked into the Athletic Club in Scott City and had the pool and hot tub to ourselves.  They seem to be trying to get cyclists to stay over with them and are very reasonable at $12 per person. The flower today was wheat because we saw so much.  Several prairie dogs were spotted also.                 "
87,"We ate at Day Lite Donuts before leaving Scott City and were pleased to find out the menu had more than just donuts.  It had muffins as well as gravy biscuits.  It was the breakfast place in town as everybody seemed to stop by. We passed several stock yards on the way to Leoti, our lunch stop.  The aroma was not near as bad as those in Larned.  One barn had a sign stating ""Here's the Beef"".  Most of the yards were not full and we appreciated it.   The flower today was the tumbleweed.  Cliff and Molly actually had one attack their front wheel.  The tumbleweed lost.  The bird today was the hawk.  We had a pretty stiff crosswind all day and the hawk we watched was enjoying it as he glided with it. Tribune was our destination but we rode a few miles further to Horace to stay at the Hunt Club, kind of a motel and reasonable at $40 per room.  The owner was gracious enough to allow us to use the laundry facilities and kitchen. As we're only 16 miles from Colorado, we hope to sneak in tomorrow.  According to Donna Lynn Ikenberry's book we should start seeing the Rocky Mountains in a couple of days.  It will be nice to see the scenery change.  We're getting tired of being able to see the water tanks and grain elevators 6 and 8 miles from town.           "
88,"We were told today that we are on the high plains.  When we entered our destination of Eads, Colorado, the welcome sign stated the elevation as over 4100 feet.  We've been steadily climbing for the past week.  It was a great feeling when we entered our sixth state of Colorado. There was no lunch stop today as the only store on route was closed.  We met two other westbound cyclists today about 6 miles east of Eads.  They were headed for San Francisco and about 25 miles further today, but joined us for some food when we got to town.  Their names were Andrew and Nathan.  The flower today was the gray-headed coneflower.  As far as animals we saw plenty of jack rabbits and cows. Road kill was interesting as we saw a Barn Owl and a coyote.       "
89,"We rode out of Eads early under overcast skies.  Shortly after leaving town we started seeing deer and antelope on the side of the road.  There was a large earth berm alongside the road which we believe is some kind of buffer for wind.  The first half dozen deer were on top of the berm watching us pass by. We stopped at Haswell to take a break and mail some items home and visited the ""world's smallest jail"".  It was located next to the city park where Andrew and Nathan (westbounders we met yesterday) had camped. We rode beside railroad tracks all day but didn't see a single one.  We did come across half of a brand new doublewide mobile home that was flipped over on its top.  Don't know how it got there but it gave us something to explore.  Traffic was pretty light all day. We stopped in Sugar City for lunch and met two eastbounders.  They had been fighting our tailwind all morning and looked tired.  Both were headed for Maine.  The cafe we had lunch in had a collection of over 350 cookie jars.  The owner said the local fire department had instructions on which ones to rescue in case of a fire. Today's flower could not be identified.  We have moved into an area where the flowers are again different and Lisa could not name them.  We'll search for another wildflower guide for this part of the country and get back on track. We checked into the Hotel Ordway and decided on a private room instead of the cyclists area.  If there had been some other cyclists we would have opted for the common area but decided we had seen enough of each other all day.  Madeline Ferguson's daughter now runs the hotel and gave Anna a tour of some of the remodeled rooms.  She and her husband are very nice hosts.           "
90,"Everybody else at the Ordway Motel was asleep as we rolled out about 6 o'clock this morning.  Most of our days on the plains have started out cloudy and cleared around mid-afternoon but today started out clear and a little warmer than days before.   We rode to Olney Springs for breakfast at Jada's Cafe.  We expected to find Dingo's Cafe but it hasn't existed for several years.  The owner of Dingo's always gave a free slice of pie to passing cyclists.  Breakfast was good at Jada's and we talked to some locals who were interested in our trip. After leaving Olney Springs we got our first glimpse of the Rockies.  Molly and Anna were not as impressed as Cliff and Lisa.  In two days we should be making our first big climb over Currant Creek Pass at an elevation of 9,404 ft and the following day over Hoosier Pass at 11,542 ft.  If the altitude causes us any problems we'll reconsider the distances and cut back if necessary. We met five other cyclists headed east to Maine.  About half of the eastbound cyclists we've met seem to be heading for Maine. Upon arrival in Pueblo we ate in the River Walk area of town then rode to the Great Divide bike shop.  The shop had a replacement seat post bolt and replaced Lisa's timing chain which had stretched beyond adjustment.  Anna also replaced her water bottle that had developed a leak.  The owner was very nice and helpful with advice about Pueblo.     "
91,"At the suggestion of the owner of the Great Divide bike shop, we rode a different route from Pueblo to Canon City (pronounced 'Canyon').  We rode on US 50 most of the day to avoid another road without shoulders and heavy traffic.  If we had not just spent our last 10 days on roads with no traffic it wouldn't have been so bad.  US 50 had good shoulders but the buzz of traffic got on our nerves.   We learned today that the county that Canon City is in also has thirteen prisons.  They have the old territorial prison that was so famous in old west days.  We counted at least four prisons on our route today.  We talked to a couple of locals today and decided to stay at the Jellystone Campground at Royal Gorge.  Anna enjoyed the hay ride and later she and Molly still had enough strength to shoot some basketball.  Lisa and Cliff took a dip in the hot tub to relax. We gained a little over a thousand feet in elevation today.  Jellystone is at about 6300 ft above sea level.  The flower of the day was a cactus with red flowers.  We'll try to get the name later.             "
92,"Today's ride was short for one reason.  We did a lot of climbing from Royal Gorge to Guffey and had decided to stay at the Currant Creek Hostel.  Don't know if the altitude was getting to us or the climbing, but we knew we couldn't make it to Fairplay at the rate we were going. When we decided to stay at the hostel we also knew we would need more food than we were carrying so we went off route to Guffey.  It was only a little over a mile and there was a bar that served food.  As we were leaving, Cliff stopped at the Guffey Garage to buy some gas for the cook stove and we met Bill, the proprietor.  Bill gave Cliff and Lisa a beer and showed them the cabin he had for travellers.  He called it the Honeymoon Cabin and it had been built in 1890.  No running water but it was quite cozy.  It had a real nice outhouse and came complete with washtubs and a gallon of warm water for each to bathe with.  We must mention that there were York peppermint patties on each pillow. Bill also gave us the key to City Hall which is also the museum.  It was a really neat place.  The mayor of Guffey is Monster, a big black cat.  Tradition in Guffey is to have an animal as mayor.  Our map shows the population as 10 but we learned that it is now near 30.  Our only regret is that we will miss the Chicken Flying Contest on July 4. The reason for today's title is because Bill has thirteen outhouses in Guffey.  It takes several pages in the Colorado Outhouse Guide to cover all of Bill's outhouses.  All of the other entrants only need a page.   We saw sweet yellow clover on our ride today and greener meadows.  We saw horse ranches on our way up to Guffey also.                       "
93,"We ate the bagels our hosts at Guffey had left for us and headed for Currant Creek Pass at an elevation of 9404 ft.  We hadn't realized we had done the most difficult climbing yesterday.  The 11 miles to the pass went by rather easily as we were escorted by Lark Buntings, the Colorado state bird.  When we got to the top of the pass the view of the snow-capped mountains was almost breathtaking.  None of us had ever seen this kind of view before.  With each day in the Rockies we are also reaching higher elevations by bike than we have ever achieved. The valley north of Currant Creek Pass was wide and filled with big ranches.  We saw a lot of antelope and buffalo, as well as cattle and horses.  We are looking forward to seeing our first wild buffalo since all we have seen are ones on ranches.  We haven't tried a buffalo burger yet either. Today's lunch stop was in Hartsel, a town slightly larger than Guffey.  Soon after leaving Hartsel we rode alongside the South Platte River to Fairplay. The flower today was the Cow Parsnip.  We also came across some Quaking Aspen trees. We must comment on the number of smokers we have seen the past two days.  Not your average hardcore, 2 pack a day smokers, but the ones with an oxygen bottle strapped to their back and a clear tube run to their nose, just above where the cigarette is hanging out of the mouth.  Cliff started to ask one fellow yesterday if he had a spare bottle we could take with us. ( Brady, it was oxygen, not noxygen)             "
94,"It was cold when we went out for breakfast at 6:30 this morning.  Everyone put on undershirts, arm warmers and vests, then after breakfast Molly and Anna put on their tights.  We rode 5 miles to Alma, the highest town in the US, and stopped for something hot to drink.   The next 6 miles were all climbing to Hoosier Pass at 11,542 feet.  The climb was easier than we expected and the weather at the pass was great with sunshine and blue skies.  We got another person at the pass to take our picture in front of the sign.  This is the highest point on our ride and may be the highest any of us ever cycles up. The downhill ride to Breckenridge was fun and we stopped again to have a drink before heading on.  We rode the next 15 miles on bike paths through Frisco and Silverthorne.  These were all tourist trap towns and we were glad to get away from them.  The bike paths were a real change from the highways we had been riding.  There were people of all ages on the paths and it probably kept us out of traffic but we would trade the road for the paths if we had it to do again. The next 40 miles to Kremmling were mostly downhill and along the Blue River with an occasional headwind.  The scenery along the Blue River in the White River National Forest was great.   We saw a lot of flyfishermen along the way. Today's flowers were Bittercress and Cattails.

   July 4, 2004            "
95,"Today's ride had no stores along the entire length, so we loaded up with donuts and muffins for a mid-morning snack.  What a diet.  We have to eat several times a day to make sure we don't bonk on the road so we grab what we can when we can.  It's difficult finding real nutritious food all the time. We headed out of Kremmling for Muddy Pass at an elevation of 8772 ft.  The pass was a happy site because that's when we got off the busier US Hwy 40. We saw over 30 cyclists who were cycling across the U.S. for Habitat for Humanity.  They rode as far as Muddy Pass and then headed for Steamboat Springs.  They had a support van and trailer carrying all their gear and had stayed at a church in Kremmling last night. We saw many deer today but no moose.  We were supposed to be in moose country and saw what we think were moose tracks but no moose.  Deer were both mule and whitetail. Upon reaching Walden we met a family going to a dude ranch in Wyoming.  They were interested in our trip and we quizzed them about their vacation.  The dude ranch they're going to is near Encampment, WY, which is on our route tomorrow. Today's flower was Rydberg's Penstemon (violet in color).  We also saw a lot of Lodgepole Pine.  This may be why we are seeing a lot more wooden fence posts, unlike mostly steel posts earlier in Colorado.  Roadkill consisted of many deer and a Western Spotted Skunk.   "
96,"We entered our seventh state today, the state of Wyoming.  Just before leaving Colorado the wind kicked up quite a bit and we ended up fighting it all day.  We had to lean into it to keep from falling over except for the last eight miles when we turned and got a  stiff headwind.  We've been told by local residents that we can expect wind while we're in Wyoming. Traffic was light and it seemed people were friendlier as many waved to us on the road.  We were also given more room when passed by cars. While eating lunch in Riverside a reporter from the Saratoga Sun stopped by our table for a chat.  She questioned each of us about the trip and then photographed us a couple of miles from Saratoga.  She promises to send a copy of the article. Today's destination was changed to Saratoga because we found out there was no place to stay in Walcot.  Saratoga has hot springs which was just what we needed after fighting the wind today.   Today's flower was Silver Sage.  Roadkill consisted of many, many Prairie Dogs.  Cliff had trouble dodging all of them with the trailer wheels.   "
97,We left Saratoga later than we wanted and headed for Rawlins with intentions of going further if the wind remained calm.  It didn't so we toured the Wyoming State Peniteniary after stopping by the local bike shop for a missing bolt.   Today's ride included a 13 mile stretch on Interstate 80 due to no other road being available.  The WY DOT had combined 2 US highways with I-80.  We were legal and actually felt safer than when we were on parts of Hwy 9 in Colorado. We stopped in the town of Sinclair for lunch at Su Casas.  We had to wait about 30 minutes but it was worth it.  We all agreed that it was the best Mexican food we had ever eaten.  Su Casas can only seat about 20 people at a time.  We were told by locals of another mexican restaurant in Rawlins that was just as good but even smaller.  It's in an old box car. In less than 2 hours we saw 7 trains between Sinclair and Rawlins.  We had ridden for over a week beside railroad tracks in Kansas and Colorado and never saw a single train. Today's flower was the Astor.  Roadkill today was scarce.  Don't know if the scavengers had already cleaned them up or there just wasn't much.       
98,"We ate lunch at Grandma's Cafe after crossing the Continental divide.  You should have seen, and tasted, the thick slices of bacon we had on our sandwiches.  About an hour later the wind really started stirring up. After dismounting and walking a couple of miles we stopped at the historical site for Split Rock.  There are several trails that early settlers used when they headed west in the 1800's and they used Split Rock as a guide the day before reaching it and for several days after passing it.  The Sweetwater River flows nearby and the settlers followed it on their journeys.  We read that the Mormons usually stayed on the opposite side to avoid conflicts with others on the Oregon Trail. The government has also pastured wild horses along this highway(US287).  As we moved along the highway we saw several herds of horses. The wind continued to blow in our faces for the last 15 miles.  It was actually better than the crosswind.  A couple from Virginia who we met at Split Rock gave us canned root beer and tea because we thought we might have to camp alongside the road.  We made it to the JC Motel in Jeffrey City and got a motel room.  The mosquitos were terrible outside.  We ate supper at the only cafe in 30 miles and bought snacks for breakfast. Today's flower was the Astor.  We continue to see many antelope and deer.     "
99,Sweetwater Station had a store and rest area that we used for brunch.  This is also another crossing over the river that the travellers of the Oregon Trail used.  Just before Sweetwater Station we passed a unique area where an ice slough existed just underneath the soil.  Early settlers would dig down and remove chunks of ice to put in their water barrels so that they could have cool water for the day. We stopped at Sleeping Bear Campground for a very late lunch and were tempted to get a site for the night.  For some reason the wind was in our favor and we continued into Lander.  We took a vote and decided a layover day was in order to rest up from the three days of wind. The flower of the day was Rydberg's Penstemon.       
100,"We got a room at the Maverick Motel because someone had cancelled about the time we walked in the office.  Turns out that the owners used to live in Tamassee, SC, within a few miles of our home.  Their partner also lived in SC and used to work at the same place Cliff and Lisa work.  They were thrilled to meet someone from home."
101,"Today's ride was an early start at 6:00 from Lander.  Not far out of Lander we entered the Wind River Indian Reservation and stayed in it for most of the ride.  We rode on and off with two westbound cyclists, Scott and Christopher, for the first 45 miles.  They left our store stop before us then Patrick, another westbounder, joined us for the remainder. We rode off a plateau into what looked like a canyon that the Wind River runs through.  Different colored layers of rock and dirt were exposed on the walls. It was a beautiful site.  In the distance we could see a prominent butte which we later learned was named Crowheart Butte.  It was named for Chief Washaki, a Shoshone, after he removed a heart from a rival Crow warrior.  Coool huh. We saw more horses today than we have seen any other day of the ride.  Most were along the indian reservation but even after leaving the reservation we saw many more.  Seeing all the horses really got Molly stirred up and she talked about them the rest of the day.                 "
102,"We ate breakfast with Scott, Christopher and Patrick, then left Dubois for our climb up Togwotee Pass.  It was a fairly gradual climb that was about 30 miles long but none of it was real steep.  About ten miles from the pass we spotted a herd of wild horses and mules.  About eight miles down the other side we got our first view of the Tetons.  They were magnificent looking from the view we had.  Molly took pictures from a viewing area near the road.  We saw them for the rest of the day. After lunch we entered the Teton National Park and Anna spotted an American White Pelican in the Snake River.  The woman at the park gate was confused when we pulled up and she had to ask her supervisor what to charge a tandem bicycle.  They ended up charging us $10 per bike which we thought was a good deal.  Individuals were $10 each which would have been $40 total.  The fee was good for both Teton and Yellowstone parks.   We met a father and son from Portland, OR that were headed east.  We did our usual 15 minute stop and traded information.  They had a solar panel strapped to the rear of one bike for powering the laptop they carried.  The father was a recently retired teacher and guessed Anna and Molly's age exactly. The flower of the day was the Sticky Geranium.  We had hoped to see a moose or buffalo but none were to be found.           "
103,"Today's destination was originally Grant Village but we decided to try tand make up some time and stretched it out to Old Faithful.  Tomorrow we'll try for Montana after getting mail in West Yellowstone. It was 43 degrees when we woke up this morning.  We all bundled up, ate a snack and hit the road in an attempt to beat some of the RVs out.  We rode 17 miles to breakfast at Flag Ranch then had to traverse four miles of dirt road due to construction.  The road crew had wet the road to minimize dust so we got a good bit of mud on the bikes.  Traffic really picked up after breakfast.  The combination of no shoulder and RVs too long and wide for the road made it very stressful, for us and the drivers of the RVs.  After Grant Village the volume decreased and we could actually relax a little. Old Faithful was really packed with people but it was fun watching her spout out steam and water.  We were relaxing on the Inn's balcony when a tour bus pulled up and unloaded.  The amount of baggage these people had was unbelievable.  It seemed that each person had two or three suitcases and we have been living out of a pannier the size of a handbag for over seven weeks.  Maybe we were just jealous.    The flower of the day was the Indian Paintbrush.  This is Wyoming's state flower.  We also saw many ravens alongside the road today.  After dinner we watched elk and buffalo graze around the inn.     "
104,"We took our time leaving this morning and got to see two bison next to the inn.  One was just feet away from the sidewalk eating grass while people walked by.  These are some awesome animals especially when you get that close. We got to watch the guys load the luggage on the bus they unloaded yesterday.  The driver said they load and unload every day at a different place. The road crews were geting ready to tar and gravel the road as we passed by.  What luck after riding through mud yesterday.  We hit the car wash in West Yellowstone to clean the dirt off and there was a motorcycle cleaning up too.  They were headed to the BMW rally in Spokane, WA.  This motorcycle had a sidecar for the wife and dog and pulled a miniature camper behind.  It was quite a contrast to our rig. We saw a lot of elk on our way out of Yellowstone Park.  Most were in the Firehole River and the Madison River. We picked up mail after reaching West Yellowstone and Molly was excited to get a letter from Jessica.  We were all happy to get the package from Lois and Herb also(yum yum).  We also mailed accumulated stuff back home. While doing laundry we met a friend of someone we know in Maine.  It was John Lawler from Auburn, NY.  We talked for too long and traded email addresses.  John is just one of many we've met along our journey that is somehow connected to us or someone we know(small world).   The flower of the day was the Yellow Stonecrop.                   "
105,"Patrick met us this morning in West Yellowstone and all of us headed out of town together.  Near Hebgen Lake Cliff and Molly got to meet a bison up close when it came next to the road to eat some grass.  It was kind of intense for a moment and they didn't get any pictures.  Cliff steered the tandem to the far side of the road and instructed Molly to get the pepper spray ready(like it was going to stop a charging bison).  Fortunately, the grass was more inticing than the tandem. We also saw a bald eagle.  Anna grabbed a photo. Our route took us alongside the Madison River most of the day.  We saw a lot of flyfisherman either in boats or wading in the river.  According to a fisherman we met in Ennis, the fish weren't biting. After passing the dam we ate breakfast at the Cabin Creek Cafe.  Great pancakes and cinnamon rolls and really friendly people.  The cafe is right beside the Madison River with a great view. We saw the Habitat for Humanity cyclists today.  They were riding the same route as us and invited us to lunch at a rest area but we declined and waited until the saloon in Cameron.  It was full of smoke so we also declined and waited until Ennis for a late lunch.  The temperature reached into the mid 90's today and we got a photo of the Habitat cyclists crashed at Cameron on the walkway in front of the saloon.   The flower of the day was the Aster.  We also had a bird of the day, the American White Pelican.  We spotted several flying over while we were eating breakfast.                         "
106,"We started out from Ennis this morning with a 10 mile climb.  It was a wise choice to wait until today instead of trying it yesterday when we were tired.  The ride from the top down to Virginia City was a breeze.  Virginia City was still asleep so we rode another mile to Nevada City and the Star Bakery. Most of the buildings in Virginia City and Nevada City are now owned by the state of Montana and run by individuals.  A resident told us that both towns had been rebuilt by a man who was wealthy and did it as a hobby.  The Star Bakery had some great food.  Next door was the hotel with its doubledecker outhouse.  It was two stories so that it could still be used in winters when the snow got too deep. Later at Twin Bridges we met several cross country cyclists who were part of a group tour.  They had a van carrying their gear and showed us a few places we might get lunch.  After lunch we met another couple, Mary Scott and Bob Coffey from Blacksburg, VA.  They are friends of John Bryant, a cyclist we know from home.   The flower of the day was Sagebrush.  We saw many sheep today.  They outnumbered the cows we believe.  It was warm enough that they were getting underneath the sprinklers in their pastures to cool off.                         "
107,"We tackled two passes this morning, Badger Pass and Big Hole Pass.  By the time we got to Big Hole Pass we were hunting for the big hole to get through the mountain.  It was nearly 1:00 when we finally got to the top of Big Hole Pass and we headed down to Jackson for lunch. We met the same group of cross country cyclists we ran into yesterday.  They were staying in Jackson for the night but we'll probably run into them tomorrow enroute to Hamilton.  Also met a father and his twin 14 year-old girls riding from southern Alaska to possibly Florida. We saw some unusual structures in the Big Hole Valley today.  The Big Hole Valley is known as the land of 10,000 haystacks.  The structures are called beaver slides and are used to stack loose hay.  The use of round hay balers has just about stopped the use of the beaver slides. Lisa talked to a 9 year-old girl in Jackson after lunch today and found out they have a school for K through 8th grade and have 26 students.  The high school students have to go to Dillon by bus over the 2 passes we came over and don't have snow days.  The population of the town of Jackson is about 38 according to our map.     The flower of the day was 'Needle and Thread', actually a grass.  We saw a lot of antelope and hawks today.  Most of the hawks were red-tailed.

108,"The climb up to Chief Joseph Pass took about 26 miles from Wisdom and was a gentle grade for the most part.  The last 2 miles steepened some but was still easier than yesterday's climbs.  After cresting the pass at 7241 ft, we could see Lost Trail Pass on US Hwy 93.  The mountain west of us was Saddle Mountain and the ski slopes were visible on it.  When we intersected US 93 the Idaho state line was only about a hundred yards away. The ride down the mountain was fast.  We stopped at Sula for lunch and again at Darby for ice cream. Darby was having their annual Logger Festival but we didn't stay around.  We rolled into our destination of Hamilton at 4:00.  The thermometer was reading 98 degrees.  We saw a lot of deer today.  On our way up to Chief Joseph Pass we saw a doe and 2 fawns, both still sporting spots.  Along US 93 we saw several more, even one eating grass in a yard.  A lady working at the laundromat said they're a real nuisance in the area, breaking down fences to get into gardens. Patrick rode with us again today.  We'll be parting ways tomorrow as he heads into Missoula and we head over to Lolo Hot Springs.  He'll be making his way north to pick up the Northern Tier Route and eventually to Seattle.  We have decided to bypass Missoula in order to gain a little time.  We would have arrived there on Sunday and the Adventure Cycling Headquarters would have been closed.       "
109,"We left Hamilton in a light drizzle this morning and the drizzle lasted for most of our ride.  Patrick caught up to us twenty miles down the road when we stopped for a cinnamon roll in Stevensville.  Our destination for lunch was Lolo and we pulled into the Haystack Saloon about 12:00.  The last eight miles into Lolo were on a new bike path and we didn't get lost this time. Since Patrick was heading into Missoula and on to Seattle from there, this would be the last time we would see him since we were riding toward Idaho from Lolo.  We've spent a little more than a week with Patrick and have really gotten to know him.  The remainder of the day's ride was like a funeral until we came across Bambi. Anna spotted Bambi along US Hwy 12 as we were heading up to Lolo Hot Springs.  Bambi was a little fawn with spots and had gotten tangled in some farm fence while jumping over it.  It took Cliff a few minutes but he finally got Bambi's rear leg out of the wire and he was off to find his mother.  We must add that Cliff managed to perform the rescue without any injury to himself. The flower of the day was the Ox Eye Daisy.  They were blooming all alongside the roads.  Sheep and horses were among the most popular animals seen today.       "
110,"Today's ride took us into our ninth state and next time zone.  We left Lolo Hot Springs and finished the climb up to Lolo Pass.  The visitor's center at Lolo Pass is run by the Forest Service and is real nice.  This area is filled with history about Lewis and Clark and the Nez Perce Indians.  The Nez Perce used the Lolo Trail as a buffalo trail and Lewis and Clark used the trail for their expedition.  US Hwy 12 which we rode on parallels most of the Lolo Trail. From the pass we started the 65 miles downhill to Lowell.  The first few miles were steep but after that we had to pedal most of the way.  We followed the Lochsa River all day as it curved down through the mountains. The Lochsa River had a lot of wildlife around it.  We saw many osprey nests and watched one fly into its nest with food for its babies.  We also saw many deer at the edge of the river.  Some kayakers were also out enjoying the river and entertained us as they went through the whitewater sections. We met 3 other westbound cyclists in Lowell.  A couple from the Netherlands and another man from North Carolina.  The cyclist from North Carolina just retired from the Marines and is headed to Corvallis, OR. The flower of the day was the cattail.  We saw many other flowers, some of which we had seen earlier in our trip but were just starting to bloom in this area.               "
111,"We rode a short distance to Kamiah to meet our friends Bob, Brenda and Holly.  We had arranged to spend a day with them and incorporate a rest day.  We spent the day on Dworshak Lake on their pontoon boat, swimming, eating and catching up on the last 10 years.  We had a great time.                       "
112,"We headed out of Kamiah and back to Kooskia and our route.  As soon as we got to the other side of Kooskia, Cliff spotted a neon Expresso sign and all stopped for a drink.  We continued up the South Fork Clearwater River and met two English cyclists heading to Virginia.  These guys were travelling ultra-light, about 15 lbs of gear.  The older of the two had previously ridden the Transam route from east to west. We climbed out of the river valley to farmland surrounding Grangeville and met two more eastbound cyclists, a couple from Ft. Collins, CO.  They were going from Eugene, OR to Bozeman, MT and we traded information about the route up ahead. We decided to cut today short and stay in Grangeville so that we could UPS some stuff home.  Grangeville is a nice town of about 3,000.  The swimming pool at the motel was great too. The flower of the day was the blue flowered Camas.  The root was an important part of the indian's diet.               "
113,"We actually rode up Hells Canyon today, in a jet boat.  Molly and Anna had been wanting to take a boat or raft ride on the Snake River so arrangements were made to take a jet boat ride from Pittsburgh Landing to Hells Canyon Dam with the bikes on board. We would only get a glimpse of the Snake River if we stayed on our route and the portion we would see wouldn't be the wild part.  After riding out of Grangeville and eating breakfast in Whitebird at the Silver Dollar Saloon we contacted Kilgore's Jet Boat Service for the boat ride and then made arrangements for a place to stay in Pine Creek.  Of course Cliff double verified the route from Hells Canyon Dam to Oxbow to make sure there was a good route.  We got some strange looks from other people on the river when they saw the bikes strapped on the back of the boat. The landing was crowded with people loading rafts for multi-day trips on the river.  Some of the pack rafts looked like they had a month's supply of food and beverages.  Our guides had packed box lunches and drinks for us.  We made a stop at a farm museum, Kirkwood Historic Ranch, that was about a family that moved to the river during the Great Depression to raise sheep and live off the land.  It was amazing to see what they had done.  Talk about an isolated spot. The jet boat we rode in was great.  We were going upstream the entire ride and it went through rapids easily.  One set of rapids, Granite Creek Rapids, had a 14 foot drop that we had to go up and everyone had to put on lifejackets.  The hydroelectric dam was generating power and the river was rising the entire time we were on it. Our guides pulled into a beach area for lunch and we all got in the water to cool off.  The boat had some good squirt guns onboard and everyone got wet, including the guides. At Hells Canyon Dam we unloaded our gear and put our cycling gear back on for the trip up to Oxbow Dam and Pine Creek.  It was extremely hot riding up Hells Canyon.  We now know why it got its name.  We were glad to finish the day as we were all tired from both rides, the bike and boat. We entered our tenth and final state today.  The scenery in eastern Oregon still looks much like that of Idaho but we know it will start changing as we near the coast. The flower of the day was the Sunflower.                     "
114,"We thought we'd never get out of Hells Canyon.  It officially ended about the time we got to Baker City.  We have determined that unless you're a rattlesnake or riding in an air conditioned vehicle you can't really appreciate the scenery because of the intense heat. We started the day by climbing up to the town of Halfway for breakfast.  It's called Halfway because they originally wanted the name Midway and it had already been taken.  It's a cute little town. After breakfast we climbed again to another little town called Richland. Since it was only 13 miles away we couldn't eat lunch but did put a pretty good dent in their ice cream supply. While climbing once again out of Richland Molly noticed we had company behind us.  It was a 3 legged dog running behind us on the hot asphalt.  He had not made a sound other than heavy breathing and Cliff and Molly stopped to turn him around.  After petting the dog and a little closer observation, Molly noticed its left front paw was caught in its collar.  The paw was removed from the collar and the dog was once again 4 legged.  He appeared most happy about having the use of his fourth leg and returned home. Today was mail pick-up in Baker City and if you remember last time this happened, Lisa and Anna made a dash for the post office.  Well, this time Cliff and Molly elected to make the mad dash and with about 35 miles to go, took off for Baker City at a brisk pace.  After a much needed stop on the edge of town they made it with minutes to spare and retrieved the mail.   Both teams today ran short on water.  Lisa and Anna managed to get some water from a motorhome at the Oregon Trail Interpretive Center and Cliff and Molly made it to the edge of town and a store.  None of us were in danger of dehydrating but it was extremely hot. The flower of the day was the Sunflower, again.  The sweet smell of sage was everywhere.  Alfalfa was also present near Richland.  We spotted several deer today as well as a coyote.         "
115,"We decided on a short day after enduring the heat of Hells Canyon for 2 consecutive days.  We'll also be in better shape for the 3 passes we climb over tomorrow. We followed the Powder River from Baker City all the way to Sumpter today.  Sumpter is a small town of about 150 people and is off the Transam route a few miles.  It was once a mining community and was started by 5 ex-confederate soldiers who came here to mine.  They were from South Carolina, our home state. We stopped at McEwen about 6 miles from Sumpter and looked at the old restored train station and other equipment left over from the mining days.  We wanted to take the train the remainder of the way but the schedule didn't fit into our's.  We talked to the clerk at the depot in McEwen and she filled us in on the area history. We spotted a bald eagle today on its nest and saw another nest near the depot in McEwen.  While doing laundry in Sumpter Molly and Anna had a town deer looking in the window at them.  The locals say they have more than their fair share of town deer.  The flower of the day was phlox.       "
116,"We rode back out to the route from downtown Sumpter and as we turned onto Hwy 26, our old acquaintance Scott was cycling up the road.  We hadn't seen him since the Tetons.  Molly grabbed his photo as he were climbing up one of the three passes of the day. The three passes today were Sumpter, Tipton and Dixie, all at about 5000 feet in elevation.  Thankfully, we only had to gain a little over a thousand feet for each climb.  Dixie was the last pass and ended up with the most gentle grade of all.  After Dixie it was all downhill to Prairie City. Prairie City was a quaint little town and we had a good lunch at a cafe.  Scott had started in Baker City so he called it quits for the day and headed for the city park. We ended in John Day and visited the museum of Kam Wah Chung.  The building was constructed as a trading post in 1866-67 and was the center for the Chinese community in eastern Oregon during the Gold Rush.  The building was used as a general store, a Chinese temple, office of a famous herbal doctor and home to two important Chinese members of the community.  It was amazing the amount of items that were left in the building when it was locked up in 1948.  There was fruit on the counters that had been left there since that time.   The flower of the day was actually a tree.  We saw and smelled many lodgepole pines on the three passes we went over today.           "
117,"We are coasting down to the end of our trip.  Those with our itinerary are probably wondering what's happening.  We decided to take it easy on the next few days by planning in one major climb at most per day and we also want to have more time to visit some of the sites coming up.  Plans are to reach Florence on Sunday, 8/1. Today was an easy ride to Dayville.  We missed Scott this morning as he probably passed through John Day before we got started.  We did notice a cross-country cyclist passing through John Day after breakfast and caught up to him a few miles from Dayville.  His name is Chuck and he was the ride leader for the Adventure Cycling group that left Yorktown two weeks ahead of us.  He's now on his own and was interesting to talk to.  We have heard of Chuck since Kansas and knew he was ahead of us.  It's amazing how the info network works out here on the Transam route. We took a break in Mount Vernon and mailed some gold nuggets back home.  The town was named after a famous race horse.  It was a nice place.  The locals we talked to were very nice. We got to Dayville shortly after noon and found the cafe open, so we ate lunch and explored town for three hours before checking into the Fishhouse Inn B&B and RV Park.  The Mercantile is owned by a cyclist who now lives in Baker City and operates a B&B there.  The store was better equiped than any bike shop we encountered on our trip so far.  It's been difficult to find touring cyclists parts and tires.  The Mercantile had an enormous inventory and also stocked wine and alcohol.  They even had Ben and Jerrys ice cream. Dayville's population is about 200 and is one of those little towns that is just nice to walk around, which takes no more than 10 minutes.  We ate our supper under some maple trees in the yard after playing with the owner's golden retriever.  Luckily they had just placed the last few puppies their dog had.  This seems to be a pretty laid-back place and we enjoyed the rest. The flower of the day is another tree.  The town has a maple tree that measures 23 ft., 6 in. in diameter.  There are a few more that look pretty close.           "
118,"We started with an easy ride to the John Day Fossil Beds National Monument Visitor Center.  On the way there we rode through Picture Canyon.  It had steep walls and just enough room for the river and road.  It was named Picture Canyon because the indians used the different colored rocks to draw pictures.   The visitor center was brand new, just opening last December.  It is located at the Sheep Rock Unit of the John Day Fossil Beds.  A lot of the fossil research in the fossil beds is carried out at the center.  The displays were very descriptive giving a good idea of what happened here in the last 40 to 50 million years.  We stayed for a presentation about the John Day site by a National Park Service Ranger. We stopped for a roadside break and snack under the most unusual tree.  It had a bunch of shoes hanging from the branches.  Most were pairs of boots or athletic shoes but there were some high heels and kids shoes.  Later down the road we saw another tree with shoes in it also. The locals told us it got started when some kids threw their shoes into one tree and the owner threatened to cut it down.  When he did that more people started throwing shoes into more trees on his property along the highway. The town of Mitchell is pretty small but it has a nice park and bathrooms with showers.  Henry the bear resides at the local gas station.  If you're around at 8:00 a.m. you can have your photo taken feeding him. The flower of the day is Moth Mullen.  This stretch of road today was similar to Hells Canyon.  We saw very little wildlife.             "
119,"While at breakfast at the Little Pine Cafe in Mitchell, a local guy named Jack came in for tea.  He had a little schnauser called Isaac that entertained everyone from outside the window.  We had seen them yesterday in the same cafe and they were both characters. After breakfast Molly and Anna crossed the street to visit Henry the bear.  Henry is a black bear with his front claws removed.  The current owner saved him from being put down four years ago after he was born in captivity and the original owners could not keep him.  Molly and Anna went into his pen for pictures while he was eating breakfast.  Usually the owner allows visitors to feed him apples but Henry had already had nectarines and his sweet tooth was temporarily satisfied. The ride up to Ochoco Pass was a good climb as we had trees for shade.  We saw several hawks and an osprey.  We also noticed a few skeletons from roadkill but not near the number as recent days.  One skeleton was a well-preserved cow skeleton. We had lunch at a cafe alongside a small lake on Hwy 26.  The food was really good and the service great.  Molly and Cliff had garlic roasted hamburgers that they tasted the rest of the way into Mitchell. Mitchell is a town of about 8500 with a real nice library.  Cliff and Lisa were able to get on the internet and check email and the journal.  Journal entries for days 45, 46 and 47 did not get posted but backups were sent to another address so they'll get incorporated after the trip. The flower of the day was the Yellow Stonecrop.  It looks just like the one on the postcard Lisa bought at the store.     "
120,"We think it's geting light out in the morning later as we travel further west.  It doesn't really matter though as there's plenty of light when we get on the road at 7 or 8.  Today was another short day and we took our time leaving Prineville. We left town on O'Neil Highway which is less traffic than Oregon Hwy 126, but it was a little rough and had a stretch of construction.  When we reached the construction section which was one-way for 5 miles we were greeted by a flagman that told Cliff we had better 'hump it on through'.  Cliff answered with a sarcastic 'or what' and we proceeded when our turn came.  Both tandems managed to maintain a 20 to 25 mph speed through the construction zone when the pilot car wasn't holding them down.  Too bad the same flagman wasn't on the other end of the zone. Espresso stores are showing up on nearly every corner now, which makes it hard for Cliff not to stop.  In Redmond we stopped for a break at a A&W to recover from the construction zone pace.  You wouldn't believe how big the small frosty mugs were. Shortly after leaving Redmond, Cliff and Molly got their second flat of the trip.  It was a piece of glass from the shoulder.  Before reaching Sisters we got our first glimpse of the snow covered Three Sisters, Faith, Hope and Charity.  Black Butte could also be seen in the distance.  We would have seen them sooner if not for the smoke from a nearby forest fire just north of here.  Hopefully the view will clear up some when we cross McKenzie Pass tomorrow. Sisters is a nice little tourist town of about 800 people. We made a stop at the Bad Ass Coffee Shop after a lunch break.  Molly and Anna got t-shirts but know they can't wear them to school.  After buying the t-shirts and a few other items we had to visit the post office to send them home. We're staying at the Best Western in Sisters and they have llamas on the premises and allow guests to feed them.  Molly and Anna tried but they weren't interested.   The flower of the day was the sunflower.  We saw many horses along the way also.
"
121,"The proprietors at the Best Western in Sisters told us of a nice side road over to McKinsey Hwy that was real quiet.  It was and when we turned onto McKinsey Hwy it looked like a deserted road.  We saw very few cars the entire way up to the pass and most of the ride was shaded by trees on both sides of the road.  We voted it our best pass of the trip. We stopped at a viewing  point at the Little Belknap lava flow and took photos of Mt. Jefferson, Mt. Hood, Mt. Washington and Belknap Crater.  We talked to several tourists then a cyclist came up behind us.  Her name was Melody Mayer and she was heading to Eugene later to participate in the Comotion Tandem Classic Race with her husband who had passed us in the car minutes earlier.   When we reached the McKinsey Pass summit at 5325 ft. we also got to meet Melody's husband, Bill Scheidt, and their two full size poodles.  Anna and Molly enjoyed petting the poodles while the grown-ups talked about cycling and the tandem race. Two of the Sisters mountains could be seen from the pass in addition to the other mountains seen earlier.  We climbed up to Dee Wright Observatory to get a better look.  It was named after a man that started its construction and died before its completion.  He had been a masonry foreman for a lot of the rock buildng done by the CCC.  Shafts had been built into the tower to help people identify the mountains in the distance. The ride down the other side of the pass was beautiful, reminding us of some of the mountain descents back east.  We descended most of the way to McKinsey Bridge where we ate lunch then headed to Holiday Farms where we would spend the night.  We ended up with a cottage on the McKinsey River and watched rafters pass by in the afternoon. The flower of the day was the Prince's Pine.  We also started seeing many ferns and large trees as we moved further west today.               "
122,"Today started in the McKinsey River valley where we left off yesterday.  We rode a quick twenty miles to the Vida Cafe for breakfast.  The cafe was small but had great food and service.  Outside the cafe we talked to a woman who is going to ride cross-country with her husband on tandem next year.  Cliff provided her with the journal's website before she left.  Two other gentlemen were also interested in our trip and invited us to stop at their house on the river to see their pet fish but we had to decline. The Vida Cafe claims to have a ""Monster Burger"" that's the best anywhere and we were tempted to try one but it was way too early.  A copy of a newspaper article on the wall read, ""Finally, it was in front of us, as if bathed in heavenly light.  The Vida Cafe, a haven of warmth, dryness, five napkin bacon burgers and a waitress who calls you honey.""  We had the waitress but not the five napkin burger. The ride from Vida to Eugene looked as if it were going to be stressful but we turned off busy highway 126 onto a few quiet roads that brought us to the outskirts of Eugene.  We had to ride on a 4 lane road for our ride to downtown but it did have a bike lane.  We amost freaked out at the number of traffic signals.  We went through more today than possibly the whole trip.  The downtown area turned out to be pretty nice but easier to get around on foot. Met a transam cyclist who finished in Florence two days ago and was waiting for a flight home this afternoon.  He and his nephew had left Yorktown on May 8.  We remembered reading some of their logbook entries along the way.  They had also ridden with Chuck for awhile.  We explored downtown Eugene most of the afternoon and evening.  We stopped in a local bike shop and while talking to the owner he cautioned us to keep the bikes locked up, inside.  Apparently Eugene is pretty high on the list for bike thefts.  Guess it comes with the larger population.  Most of the places we cycled through the last ten weeks didn't call for us to lock up the bikes. The flower of the day was the Queen Anne's Lace.  We saw a lot of ospreys along the McKinsey River today also. We're all looking forward to tomorrow's ride with excitement.  Hope we can sleep well.       "
123,"We didn't make up the fact that we rode 70 miles on day 70.  It was a coincidence.  We rolled into Florence about 2:00 p.m. and spent 20 minutes finding a place to dip our front wheels.  It took longer to explain to someone why we wanted our picture taken than it did to take the picture. We immediately found an espresso shop for a mocha and earl grey tea for Cliff and Lisa, then proceeded to the Dairy Queen for french fries and ice cream for Anna and an M&M blizzard for Molly.  We were all content afterwards. Today's ride started out great with 25 miles on quiet backroads then got a little stressful on Hwy 126.  It was extremely busy with people driving back from the ocean and navigating over narrow bridges.  We stopped in Mapleton for lunch at Alpha Bits Cafe and then completed the remainder of the ride into Florence. In the town of Noti we stopped for a break at a store next to the sawmill.  The sawmill had some logs that were over seven feet in diameter.  A local bike ride was also being put on called the Blackberry Bramble and we were offered free snacks from their sag stop.   As we were leaving Old Town tonight after dinner we noticed two cyclists riding down the street and one happened to be Beau, who we had not seen since Berea, KY.  He was with another cyclist named Park.  They had been chasing us for weeks and had finally caught us.  Their total for today was about 140 miles.  We plan to meet them for breakfast tomorrow.  The flower of the day was the Southern Magnolia.       "
124,"After receiving our packages of equipment and clothing from the trip it took about a week to clean everything and store it.  We've had many congratulations and questions from friends and co-workers since returning home.  Most of the questions have been centered on what was 'best' or 'worst' about the trip.  Those are also the most difficult to answer.  We did have a few bad incidences but the good far outweighed the bad and those good ones we will likely remember the most. If we had to dedicate the trip to something or someone, it would have to be Edith Haas, Lisa's grandmother.  While we were in Missouri she passed away after a fight with cancer.  Edith and George, her deceased husband, had always enjoyed traveling and we felt they would have encouraged us to take this adventure and would most likely have been in Florence, Oregon to congratulate us when we dipped our front wheels. We can't forget those at home who helped us out.  Teresa mailed our 'care' packages to the designated locations without fail and brought accumulated mail to our house during the trip.  We missed 2 of those drops due to our timing and, thankfully, she was reading this journal and knew we were OK when the packages came back to the house unopened.  Ed kept our hummingbirds fed while we were away and checked on the house.  We have found hummingbird nests the last 2 summers and actually watched the young leave the nest last year.  So, thanks to Ed, the hummers are still around for us to enjoy.  One of our cycling buddies, Joey, received our memory sticks and posted photos to the journal so others could enjoy them.  This was a time consuming task that he accomplished in his own time. Would we do it again?  YES, but we would take a different route.  It's not that we wouldn't want to see the same sites and people again but part of the adventure is exploring new places and meeting new people.  Anna has said to wait at least a couple of years and she'll go again.  Molly is a full blown teenager and might prefer to stay at home.  Lisa and Cliff truly believe that this trip was the best vacation they could have taken the girls on.  We saw a lot of 'small town' America and met people in ways that just aren't possible from a car or plane.  New friends were acquired as well. We met Beau Anderson from Sonoma, California in Virginia and rode with him through parts of Virginia and Kentucky.  We thought of him often during the remainder of the trip and were surprised when we found him and another cyclist riding down the street in Florence on the same day we reached the west coast. The day in Nickerson, Kansas, where we saw a flyer for Elaine's Bicycle Oasis, we'll always remember.  Although we only stayed with Dan, Elaine and their 4 retrievers for less than a day, it was like leaving family behind the next morning.  We hope they got the alfalfa harvested and made it to the wedding in New England.  Anna has asked to call and see when she can go get her Golden Retriever pup. We ran into Patrick Farrelly in Wyoming as he was headed from Denver to Seattle.  We really enjoyed his company in Wyoming and Montana.  It's surprising what a difference it makes when someone else joins the team.  One of the saddest days of the trip was that Sunday in Lolo when we parted routes.  It was truly like a funeral the rest of that day. We are waiting for Aron and Carry to call soon and give us the news about their little family addition.  When they joined us for the first 4 days of the trip Carry was 4 months pregnant.  It was hot and humid in Virginia and they had just left Portland, Maine with highs around 50 degrees.   We wish they could have made the entire trip but we'll cherish those 4 days we had them along. June Curry, a.k.a. the Cookie Lady, had to be the most memorable person we met on the trip.  She has been helping cyclist for 29 years on the transam route.  Her presence on the route makes all the difference in the world.  We plan to make a special trip to Virginia next year to see her once again. The dreaded dogs of Kentucky turned out not to be as bad as we were told.  Maybe it's because the dogs we encounter in the Carolinas are just about equal to them.  We will remember the one on the ride from Booneville to Berea that attacked the trailer.  We ran into another cross-country cyclist who had this same dog bite her rain jacket that was strapped to her trailer.  He hated trailers whether they were one or two wheeled.  On the other hand, we were chased by the lonely, 3-legged dog in Hell's Canyon.  He was only chasing us because he needed help getting his fourth leg out of his collar which Molly accomplished, and then he happily trotted away.  The wooden coins we got from the store in Walnut, Kansas were quite unique.  They entitled the user to a $1 discount on merchandise at the store.  We told other stores and cafes of their tactics to entice cyclists into their store.  Hopefully, the coins we passed along were used. Probably the best food we ate was at Courtney's Place in Toronto, Kansas.  We would have never thought we would get homemade ravioli and sautéed spinach in this little town on a Sunday afternoon. Guffey, Colorado was another unique little town whose residents made us change plans and stay at the Honeymoon Cabin.  Thirteen outhouses and we had one to ourselves in the backyard. Gene, the marine, we met in Lowell, Idaho as he pulled up to the café in his rain-soaked cycling clothes.  We found his journal and are relieved to know he made it to Corvalis, Oregon on time (39 days). The day we spent with Bob, Brenda and Holly on Dworshak Lake in Idaho will also stick in our memory.  We'll always remember what Bob said when making arrangements to meet them in Idaho, 'if you can ride bikes across country to Idaho, we'll find a way to meet you.'  That day on the lake brought back a lot of memories from the times we spent on Lake Jocassee with Bob on our pontoon boat.  We're taking bets that the Browns still have food left from that boat ride.
"
125,"I was leaving so I would be away for the half century birthday and it coincided with my sister's desire to visit her son in Australia.  We traveled from Vancouver, BC on Air Canada which only lands in Sydney.  From Sydney, we took a $99 Virgin Blue flight to Melbourne.  I celebrated my birthday by having a famous Australian meat pie at Victoria Market.  My daughter, a food safe graduate, has previously explained how the bacteria can be killed by high heat but the toxins they produce will remain.  The pie was piping hot but it gets all the blame for the nausea and subsequent diarrhea I experienced that night.  Fortunately, I recovered enough to attend the Melbourne Cup on November 4th, but that's another story.  Not being as sunburned and hungover as other (younger?) attendees at the Cup we started our cycling trip on the fifth of November   CLICK ON PICTURES TO ENLARGE "
126,"  We found the bikes set up with mudguards, racks and lights front and back.  We took the Mtrain from Balaclava Station in St. Kilda to Flinders Street Station.  Sometimes the train does a loop and stops at Spencer Station first but this train didn't so we got out at Flinders and rode down the street and around the corner to Spencer Station.  With the total unfamiliarity of the traffic patterns, remember we're Canadians in Australia, we decided to walk the bikes to negotiate the right hand turn on the busy street. The ticket office was friendly and because I was still wearing my helmet, inquired if I would be taking a bike onto the train - he charged the extra for the bike and when I asked if I needed to know anything special to take the bike on, he told me to just see the conductor and he would direct me to the proper car to store the bikes.  The conductor was very friendly and suggested a spot to tie the bikes up to in the baggage car so they wouldn't fall and then hole punched the tickets for the bikes.  Even after all of this, we were 40 minutes early for the train .  Two more pairs of cyclists arrived after we did.  You are allowed to take baggage into the cars if it fits onto the racks overhead.  The train departed right on time at 12:40.    At Winshelsea, there was a slight delay when we left as the train had ""traction"" problems.  Then again at Colac the train experienced traction* difficulties.  From Melbourne to Colac we chatted with a 37-year-old Australian women who was off work due to some health problems requiring a hospital stay and radiology - she was informative and entertaining.  She told us how to identify different trees, talked about the lasting influence of the gold rush and described a dinner party among friends.  The traction problems were not resolved and at 4:00 p.m. we got on a big air-conditioned bus with enough luggage room for the bikes to stand upright.  While waiting for the bus I talked to the other cyclists - one couple from Holland decked out with hybrids and Ortlieb bags - dressed in the best tour cycling gear.  The other couple - young 20's in blue jeans and t-shirts on old road bikes and no real panniers.  We were lucky and they wheeled our bikes out first - we and our bikes got on the express bus to Warnnambool.    Roundabouts, roundabouts, roundabouts - the 1st one I encountered I turned left so I wouldn't have to negotiate more than 90 degrees.  I wanted to give myself time to think these roundabouts out.  Warrnambool had far more of them than the big cities of Melbourne and Sydney but by the time we had found our way to the motel recommended to me during the bus ride we were comfortable, entering, going straight, turning left and turning right with the other traffic.  We checked into the Fig Tree caravan park for the large sum of $94.   We could have invited 3 friends to share as it had a queen and 3 singles in 2 bedrooms but as it was already 6:00 p.m. so we were not too anxious to keep hunting for accommodation. After checking in and waffling about what to do we went for pizza at a place recommended to Roberta on the bus.  After dinner we found the quilt shop and peeked through the windows - the fabric is the same as at home but costs around $25.50 (about 40% more) per metre.  We then did a bike through of a beer store where we ordered up 4 Victoria Bitter.  I missed a great picture when the fellow got the beer out of the cooler and without hesitation put it straight into Roberta's pannier.
"
127,"From Safeway we rode down Princes Highway being directed on and off the parallel service road for a bike lane.  At the edge of Warrnambool the signs directed us off the highway onto a side street through Dennington.  We came back to the highway to cross the Merri River but soon were directed onto Illawa Road which took the same direction as Princes Hwy.  In the entire time on the back road, to and from the reserve, we were not passed by a single vehicle.  Approximately 2 kilometres before the reserve we had to enter the highway again.  We turned into the reserve and coasted down into the crater, stopping to see the layers of volcanic ash.     On the park road accessible to vehicles we passed several emus on the way to the first walking trail.    We locked the bikes, took our lunches and walked to the top of one of the peaks, about 400 metres of steep cobblestones and steps. There was no one about and we enjoyed our lunch with views of the ocean and back to Warrnambool.  On the way back we encountered several people debating whether to complete the climb.  When we met one couple who asked if the climb was worth it and told them they would be able to see the ocean, the man said, ""I can drive just over there and see the ocean.""  They weren't the ones who would make it to the top.  From there we rode another 100 metres to the Natural History Centre which turned out to have a bit of food - we did see someone eating a hotdog.  The displays had pictures and descriptions explaining some of the area's history.  There was info on the local mammals and birds and native foods of the area.  We had time for one more walk and chose the Lava Tongue Boardwalk.  We walked through a swampy area and emerged into a forest where we saw some koalas in the eucalyptus trees.  That was the highlight.       We headed back to the History Centre to get our bikes and head back to town.  The road out of the park featured an incredibly steep hill up to the rim of the volcano.  There was a quick ride back to town - the bike route on the north side of the highway in town was a bit more convoluted than the one out of town but we arrived safely back at the Safeway to buy dinner supplies, tomorrow's breakfast and snacks.  We headed back to the motel.   Things to remember - if you ride clipless pedals, don't leave home without them.  Not having your feet attached doubles the work (uses half of those hard earned muscles for the same amount of work.)  And another thing, clipless pedals don't leave gouges in your legs when you're pushing the bike - it bled lots and I still have the scar. We did today without an odometre so I'm guessing it was about 40 km - 30 km for the out and back, and around the park and the balance just riding around town, morning and afternoon.  When we came back we made a stop at the quilt shop and then headed to the bike store to buy an odometer so we can keep track of where we are tomorrow.  Today's weather was perfect, cool enough to wear clothes for sun protection with only light winds.
"
128,"  We left Warrnambool just after 9:00a.m. and arrived in Port Campbell around 5:00 p.m.  In a panic, we took the 2nd room we asked about - two double beds, $108 room at the Comfort Inn.  The first place we stopped wanted $130 and while I was inquiring at the next spot others came in expressing how difficult it was finding accommodation - thus the panic.  I was lucky though - I was first in line for the laundry but I should have paid more attention as someone checking the dryer opened it and neglected to push start again.  I came back to find my time almost expired and no drying being done.  I didn't want to plug another $2 in so I took the stuff to the room to hang up.  That was a mistake, everything was still damp in the morning - the humidity must have been higher than I thought. We rode 14 km along the Princes Highway and stopped at Cheeseworld in Allansford.    The highway is flat without many sights - although even the shape of the trees was new.  After the turn off, the dairy farms started and lasted all the way to Nullawarre and beyond.  The incredible beauty of our first sighting of the ocean at the Bay of Islands can't be described.  I cannot imagine that anything along the Great Ocean Road will improve on that first impression.    After the first ocean view, the sights came fast and furious.  We turned into every scenic view area and rode our bikes to the viewing platforms and often left the bikes in order to access any steep walks or steps required for the best views.  The other tourists were sparse at the first view but the crowds grew as we travelled further east and it got later in the day.  We met a couple of cyclists from Melbourne going the same direction as us.  This was their first time touring and because he had a fully suspended mountain bike and she really wanted him to come along for the ride, she was carrying all their stuff in her panniers.  We would cross paths with them for the next two to three days.      We arrived at Peterborough, our initial destination for the day, before 3:00p.m. so we decided to eat our lunch - cheese from Cheeseworld, raisin bread, some nuts and an orange/mango juice from the local store.       The motel in Peterborough, the cheapest accommodation on the list, appeared to be well kept and probably be acceptable.  In Peterborough there was a viewpoint worth going to as it described three of the ship wrecks in the area.        After Peterborough there were several more excellent sites and then a coast from on top of the cliffs into Port Campbell.  By this point, I was appreciating the hire bikes with the fat mountain bike tires (slick centres) as the road surface had not been particularly smooth.  Even though the distances were relatively short the straight bars were creating havoc with my tennis elbow and sore shoulder.  My wrists were definitely feeling the strain.  A redeeming feature of the bike is the ""Comfort"" seat it sports - it hasn't taken anytime to adjust to it.        Road kill for the day included a magpie, something with a stripped tail (do they have racoons here?), a fox and a kangaroo.  At this point I was wishing I'd taken a picture of it as it may be the only one I see.  The weather was perfect again - cool with off and on sunshine - rode all day in just shorts and jersey.
"
129,"  We left the motel in Port Campbell before 9:00a.m. and headed into the centre of town looking for breakfast.  We stopped at the bakery but it had no foods we considered breakfasty enough.  Across the street was a restaurant, The Waves, done up with the slate and hardwood floors with the solid harvest colours on the walls which seem popular right now.  We ordered breakfast with a coffee, consistently priced at $2.80 a cup in this part of the world.  We then headed to the info centre to try and find accommodation for tonight so we wouldn't be faced with last night's panic.  Although out of her ""shire"" the woman working there was able to produce a list of accommodation in Lavers Hill, about 50 km down the road.  We chose a spot and phoned from the public phone in front of the grocery store.  Each small town only seems to have one, public phone that is.  It turned out only to cost the minimum $.40 to make the call.  Without having to worry about hurrying to get accommodation we headed out to sightsee.  The first stop we made was because a crowd had gathered to watch the laying of the pipeline to bring natural gas ashore.    We had a brief conversation with one of the locals and then headed out along the road where the Loch Ard disaster occurred 125 years ago.  The sign said to allow 2 to 3 hours to see the area proprerly but on the bikes we travelled quickly from site to site and only stayed 80 minutes.  Had we wanted to leave the bikes locked up we could have spent a bit longer by going down to the beach.   We cycled about six kilometres in the park to take it all in and there are extra pictures on the last page for some of the sites.         After leaving the Loch Ard Gorge we only travelled a short distance to the Twelve Apostles.  This site had a building and an underpass from one side of the highway to the other and a lot larger parking lot.  It was the starting point of the spectacular views if you were travelling from the east to the west.  The path had a sign saying no bikes so we decided this meant not riding them.  We pushed them with us as a fair number of people were about and even locked up the panniers were available for rifling.  We had conversations with people requiring pictures taken or offering to take our picture.  These included an Australian family of five, an American couple and a Dutch family of three driving a campervan from Sydney to Perth.  Later, on one of the last hills we were struggling up, the Australian family passed us and gave us an encouraging horn toot.  Hills!  After we left the 12 Apostles we started on the hills.  We swooped down into Princeton, thought about having a coffee but realized our extra time had been spent on sightseeing so we headed up the first steep hill.  At the top of the plateau again, we rode a short distance and then did a fast descent into a valley that took us into another world from the coast.    At the bottom we began a 17 km ascent to Lavers Hill.  The first few kilometres went smoothly as the forest around us was completely new and full of bird life.  After the first descent and a reclimb we started to get high enough that the trees were evergreens and we began to see signs of forestry.  And then, at the end of the day we started what must be the worst kind of cycling, short descents followed by slightly steeper inclines, all on tired legs.    When we finally reached what we thought was the top we had a few more rolling hills to do.  All in all, a hard day's bike riding.  When we arrived in Lavers Hill and spotted the local bar/bottle shop we stopped for a beer.  The bar was elbow to elbow with people who had returned to Lavers Hill for the 50th anniversary of the school.  When the ""mate"" at the bar asked where and how long we had ridden today and gave us a ""good effort"" it felt good. That night we tucked away in the Otways Junction Motor Inn where the sheep meandered past the deck and the parrots visited the bird feeders in hoardes.  The weather was great again - except for the steep uphills, it was cool enough to wear a jacket.   "
130," We were out of the motel room at 9:36 a.m. and over to the restaurant for poached eggs - wrote postcards while waiting.  We were the only ones in the restaurant and after awhile the cook came over and pronounced breakfast was free as she firmly set the ""poached"" eggs down in front of us.  Her poacher had broken and she ended up microwaving the eggs.   Finally got away at 10:30 - had a nice coast for the 1st 15 km and a flat ride for a few more kms and then we had to start uphill again to climb a ridge in the Otways to get back to the coast.  While resting on the uphill, we met a Swiss tour cyclist going the other way.  After telling us our bikes didn't fit, we had too much stuff, and we were going the wrong way, he said the high point of this ridge was at about 300 metres and we were at about 150 now (as measured on his GPS.)    My sister is starting to realize you can't believe anything a non-cyclist tells you - last night she asked the waitress about today's hill and she said it would be gradual, unlike the hill we did yesterday - well the hill is as steep if not steeper than yesterday.   At 32 kms we stopped at Mait's Rest for lunch (would you have guessed cheese?) and a stroll through the rain forest.  The free breakfast had worn off and we sat in the parking lot in the sunshine - yes sunshine - this morning's fog had also worn off.  We ate more cheese and raisin bread and a chocolate bar from a store in Lavers Hill.  Lavers Hill had a motel and a caravan (cabins) park and several coffeeshop/cafe places.      We strolled through Mait's Rest and then went back on the bikes to continue to Apollo Bay - it was up and then up and down for about 10 km and then the last 5 were a great coast and the scenery was spectacular.  We arrived at the info centre where they directed us to the motel that had called in in the morning to say there were rooms for $80 - cheap compared to the previous 2 nights.  After checking in I went back to the info centre to stand in line for access to the free internet.  The person before me was the mother of the family of 5 we met yesterday.  They've got their 10 and 7 year-olds out of school as well as their 5 year old, taking them on a four month tour of the south east of Australia as well as Tasmania.  They're both teachers so they are comfortable taking the work along for the kids to do.  After doing the laundry, we headed downtown (a block away) to check out the grocery store and buy breakfast.  We headed to the hotel bar (as recommended by the motel manager) for dinner - he said it would be cheap and good.  We had fish and chips and a salad for $9.50 - the cheapest fish and chips we ever found.  We watched a rugby match (France and Ireland) in the World Cup - France 43, Ireland 21.  We walked out to the point and found a golf course and then walked back along the beach - a sheltered bay with beautiful fine sand.  Horses and dogs aren't allowed on the beach from 9:00 a.m. to 7:00p.m. from December 24 to April 30.  Today's weather report -  warm enough to wear shorts out for dinner.   "
131,"   We arrived in Wye River for lunch and were entertained by a kookaburra sitting on the railing of the cafe.  The cafe worker brought out a plate of raw sliced steak and one of the customers hand fed the bird.     The next part was easy up and down except where they were doing road work.  There was one lane traffic and it was a pretty steep hill and the effort to get through quickly made the endorphins pump.  While they stopped traffic waiting for us, they took the opportunity to move equipment around on the one paved lane.    It was clouded over by the time we reached Lorne and the air was cool.  We finally found accommodation at the same caravan park as the cyclists from Melbourne who we had met just outside Port Campbell after first seeing them coming into Cheeseworld as we left.  They had a very short day today because when they reached Lavers Hill two nights ago they were unable to find any accommodation due to the 50th anniversary of the school.  They had to ride on after that exhausting hill to find a b&b after another 18 kms so they had made today a short day. We wandered around Lorne for a while but everything was closed - Monday in the off season.      We shared pizza at a place that had people in it and then walked along the beach - it was only 7:00p.m. when we got back from the beach.  The birds on the river provided the entertainment until it got dark.       "
132,"    I'm starting to worry about my wardrobe - you can see me wearing the same thing on another eventful day in my bike riding life.  http://www.crazyguyonabike.com/doc/page/pic/?pics=small&pic_id=12422&mtime=20031124223925 One good thing though, inspite of the birthday, I don't think I look any older.    Today was the ride from Lorne to Anglesea but we went on to Torquay as the road had been easy - we left Anglesea and it was nice and flat for 7 kilometres and then we took a turnoff to go to Bell's Beach as recommended by the trike www.greenspeed.com rider and a person we had met in the coffee shop in Anglesea.  It was a wonderful sweeping downhill with a couple of uphills where we could coast to the top.     After watching the surfers for a while - they must have a lot of patience as very few actually get up on waves - we started toward Torquay and the hills were brutal.  I tried different techniques - pedal like a mad woman down and muscling up the other side but I would be ready to fall over half way. I tried pedaling like a mad woman and then shifting quickly to lower gears but it was the last one that was the easiest on the legs - at the top, I didn't shift into a bigger gear - just coasted down the other side and didn't pedal until the low gear was enough and merrily spun my untired legs to the top.  We arrived in Torquay shortly after - it's a good sized town but the motels weren't obvious.     We went to the big I again and they called a B&B type place where we arranged to meet the owner at 5:30.  We spent the time shopping at the original Rip Curl surfing store, Quicksilver and an Oakley store.   I bought my daughter some Rip Curl as her souvenir thinking that the brand might mean something to her but I stuck to a pair of pajamas so she wouldn't have to wear them in public in case I had got it wrong - not that kids don't wear their pajamas out nowadays.  We arrived at the B&B to find the owner had not had time to clean up after the last guests and it didn't take us long to figure out why as he talked and told stories for at least an hour while we shivered and waited for him to leave so we could take a shower.  He did have good stories though.
"
133,  We had found a coupon in one of the tourist brochures for a buy 1 get 1 free on a $20.00 fixed menu - so we had a three course meal (excellent food) for $10.00 each.  After dinner we walked to the waterfront and met a school teacher who had a lot of knowledge on the area to share.  He would have made an excellent tour guide.  If you ever visit Geelong make sure to leave time to visit the wooden sculptures on the waterfront.

135,                  
136,"       After stuffing all my requirements for three weeks into my panniers, my bicycle weighed a ton. I could hardly move it, let alone pedal it over 1 800 kilometres! Penny and Theresa, who had transported me to the youth hostel at Land's End, laughed when I dismounted not 100 metres after leaving them, to push up a hill. But after that, it was surprisingly easy. It was just as if I'd always ridden like that, and when they later overtook me on the road, they were amazed at how far I'd gone. I was following a route I'd ordered from the CTC (Cyclist Touring Club), the Scenic Youth Hostel Route. It was longer and hillier than other routes, and at times, the instructions were ambiguous, at others they were entirely lacking. But I kept forgiving the CTC for their bad route because it took me past the most wonderful scenery, and I had good maps, Ordinance Survey 1:250 000. If ever the instructions were too obscure, I could follow a major road to my destination. The minor roads in Cornwall are only wide enough for one car, not even a car and a bicycle. I was amazed at how polite the motorists were. They give bicycles the same respect and consideration as they do other cars, and there were times when a car coming towards me would pull off the road and wait for me to pass. I felt obliged to put on a burst of speed so as not to keep them waiting. Relieving oneself can be a problem, specially as the roads and lanes   are liberally lined with stinging nettles. Buying food is also difficult. My route followed minor lanes devoid of shops. Even if I found one, I didn't feel safe leaving my laden bike with all my worldly goods outside for anyone to steal. That first day was Saturday, and I found a Post Office just before it shut at 1 pm. Post Offices there sell a lot more than stamps. I bought a litre of orange juice and a packet of Digestive biscuits, sat on the Post Office steps to consume them. The next place named on my route was the King Harry Ferry. I thought this was a town, but it turned out to be a ferry which I had to cross. I had to climb a hill to get there, up, up, up. Some of those hills, I couldn't climb even without panniers. I had a lot of pushing ahead of me. I rode right past the line of cars waiting for the ferry. A man at the front explained to his young son that it was a chain ferry, as was the case with the other ferries I crossed. The chain moves slowly as the ferry progresses, clatters and clanks as it moves.     After the ferry, I passed a beautiful old water mill, then missed some instructions, and followed the A road to St Austell. I had passed through St Austell in January when, with my cousin, Penny, I visited the Eden Project, brainchild of Tim Smit. The disused clay pits are being used to preserve a variety of eco systems in enormous biomes. Penny's brother, Rodney, and his wife, Sandra, called at the youth hostel at Golant at the end of my first day. It was good to see family members after a hard day of riding. From the window of the dining room, we watched the badgers feeding on scraps which were put out for them. Rod and Sandra offered me a lift to Exeter the next day. What a temptation!
"
137,"Looe was the next town on the route, a long hill down to cross a bridge into the town, and a longer and steeper hill out again. The houses were banked in layers on the hillside, like Clifton [Beach in Cape Town]. It was a bustling, seaside town on an estuary, no space in the car park and nowhere safe to leave my bike.     I settled for a couple of chocolate Digestives and a Mars bar while I sat overlooking the bridge and the activity on the water. I was far behind where I should have been, still had about 50k to go, so I decided to cancel my booking for Steps Bridge, near Exeter, and stay at Plymouth for the night. It was a good decision and I started to enjoy myself again. The Torpoint Ferry to Plymouth was about 30k from there. There were seven lanes of traffic leading to the ferry, each with its own traffic lights. Lane 7 was for motorbikes, cycles and emergency vehicles. I tucked in behind a huge Honda ridden by a man with a woman on the pillion. There was no charge for us. The motorcyclists told me that motorbikes and cycles were only charged when leaving Plymouth. There were several ferries coming and going, all full of cars. This was Plymouth where it all happened! Where Drake played bowls on the beach! The harbour was full of imposing military ships, and yachts sailed past. In Plymouth, smoke was billowing from a building in the main street while Police cars and fire engines sped past sounding their sirens. A school group was staying at the hostel, but I had a dormitory to myself. In the dining room, I enjoyed the company of an old couple who had done a fair amount of cycling themselves.
"
138,"The next day it rained most of the day, but it was cool and the navigation was simple, just a road across Dartmoor with very little risk of error. The road knows nothing of contours, and goes up and down all the hills. The cyclist lady at the youth hostel had told me that there was an old prison at Princetown, which had been used for French prisoners during the Napoleonic wars, but it wasn't on the main route, and it was so cold and wet, I didn't want to deviate. I bought a substantial cheese and tomato sandwich and a cup of coffee for 1.79, ate it outside in the rain.     On Dartmoor, there were miles and miles of unfenced roads, sheep wandering everywhere, and they have right of way! There were numerous Foot-and-Mouth Disease warnings, but nothing to prevent people from using the paths. I came to a wonderful downhill and was barrelling along, saw that my speed was 62 kph. What a pleasure! Then I was in a speed wobble and became airborne, spread myself all over the road. A woman travelling in the opposite direction stopped to ask if I was all right. My helmet was split, my water bottle shattered, and I was covered in bruises. I had a sore bum for days afterwards, but otherwise, I was all right. It was always reassuring to see the sign to the youth hostel, and this one was clearly visible, up a very steep and slippery hill. I struggled to drag the heavy bike to the top. The warden phoned the youth hostel headquarters to apply for half rates for me at all the youth hostels, because I was riding for charity. He received a fax back within half an hour. I carried the fax with me and was granted half rates at most of the subsequent youth hostels. Three cyclists checked in that night. One had ridden 80 miles from Cornwall that day. The other two had ridden a tandem from John O'Groats and were nearing the end of their journey. They were very encouraging, told me that the worst hills were in Cornwall and that the Lake District and Scotland would be a breeze. Steps Bridge is a self-catering hostel and no meals were provided. For supper, I walked to the Royal Oak Arms in Dunsford village. A notice outside the pub advertised ""Dogs welcome on leads"", and there were a good many. A couple came in with a huge dog called Bronwyn and a golden retriever. The woman was wearing a T-shirt which said ""There's no such thing as too many dogs."" She said her dog was a Leonburger, a combination of St Bernard, Pyrenian, Newfoundland and wild wolf. Bronwyn was as soft and gentle as she was big. When a German shepherd came in and barked at her, she practically climbed into her mother's lap and licked her all over the face.
"
139,"The hostel was 12 miles from Exeter. I set off the next day in rain. My first stop was Raleigh Cycles which was right on my route. I bought a new helmet and sadly abandoned my old one, veteran of 7 Argus Tours, which had saved my life. The traffic through Exeter was a nightmare, and my map was getting torn and soggy in the rain. The route took me through Honiton, where I bought a sandwich from a truckers' kiosk, and followed the rather obscure route instructions through narrow farm roads covered in cow dung. The sun came out and shone on the stone houses, thatched roofs, beautiful gardens and sheep and cows in the fields. I had booked that night into the Backpackers' Hostel at Glastonbury. It was a private hostel, not one of the Youth Hostel Association group. I walked up a long hill overlooking a green area with lakes, the Somerset Moors and fens. I caught sight of the Glastonbury Tor in the distance, lit by the setting sun. At the youth hostel, I was surprised to arrive just before the cyclist I'd met at Steps Bridge. I never discovered his name. I enjoyed his company at Bristol after that, but then lost touch. He was an agricultural officer and very well informed about the BSE/Foot and Mouth situation. He had malformed legs and a very awkward walk, but was a wizard on a bicycle. This hostel had a restaurant attached, where they served us an excellent meal at 10 at night. But the accommodation was the worst I came across on all my travels. The hostel was dirty and dingy, badly maintained, and the dormitory was like a railway carriage, with ablutions and sound effects attached.
"
140,"Cheddar is another tourist trap with a museum and cheese-making demonstration. I bought my lunch from a little café on the side of the road, asked for a sandwich with genuine cheddar from Cheddar. The proprietor told me that he could give me genuine cheddar, but they bought it from another town. It's not made in sufficient quantity to satisfy the market. He recognized my SA accent and we started chatting. He told me that his partner, a woman, had lived and worked in SA for three years. She'd been arrested for ""plotting to overthrow the state"" after a private conversation on the street, detained for a week, CANED and deported. It was the first time I'd heard of a woman being caned, and I was shocked and ashamed. The gorge was spectacular and I was glad I'd taken the opportunity to see it - vast cliffs towering above the road, the scene changing at each bend.     The wind was still blowing, and now I had an added complication - conflicting road signs. I passed one pointing to Bristol 11 miles, and another pointing in the opposite direction - Bristol, Bath. It took me a long time and a lot of extra mileage to sort that one out. I eventually got directions from a woman walking her dog. I learnt that if you want reliable directions, ask a woman who's walking a dog. Even when I arrived in Bristol, it took me 2 hours to find the youth hostel, and I had missed supper. But the city was such a surprise, I would have liked more time there. The hostel is on the ship canal, a long waterfront with shops, restaurants and activities along both sides. There was a Viking boat and barges. It made the long day worthwhile. I bought a delicious supper from a Turkish man at a kiosk selling falafels, which are like pita bread with fillings.   "
141,"Turning off the main road, I hit the wind that had buffeted me the previous day, but I also caught my first sight of the Severn Bridge. There are two bridges over the Severn, both carrying motorways, but only the northern one has a cycle path which is also reserved for mopeds and wheelchairs. It must be about 3k across. The towers with their stays went for miles up into the sky. It gave me vertigo just to look at them. I was terrified and pushed most of the way across. The wind was strong and there was a vast expanse of water far below. It was like crossing the sea.     On the other side of the bridge, I approached a man to ask the way to Chepstow. When I saw his face, I was so fascinated that I found it hard to concentrate on what he was saying - it was a mass of studs all over, eyebrows, nose, lips, but the strangest thing was two spikes sticking out sideways from his eyebrows.    Mrs. Grassby's B & B was a luxurious place in a beautiful garden. The house was like an art gallery. She had collected original works from all over the world, and gave me a conducted tour. I had time to tour Chepstow, which had a castle, and bought some lovely, greasy Southern fried chicken with chips. My bedroom had its own TV set. I watched a programme called The Royal Frock-up, about some of the tasteless clothing worn by the Royal family
"
142,"    It started to rain before I reached Ross-on-Wye, a dynamic, exciting place with crowds of active people. The houses and shops are built on a steep slope in narrow streets curving down the hill. Although it was so old, everything looked well cared-for and there was a bright and lively atmosphere. The route schedule was very confusing after that. After struggling along minor lanes and falling in the sand, I decided to take the A road through Hereford. This was a bad decision. It was miles and miles to Clun, where I was booked in at the youth  hostel. After pushing up a hill the length of two Polly Shortts,(heart-break hill at the end of the Comrades Marathon between Durban and Pietermaritzburg, where grown men have been known to cry) I arrived at 11 at night, and again, it was a self-catering hostel without food. The wardens had waited up for me and offered me hot chocolate from their own supplies, and I met another End-to-End cyclist who was on the same route that I was on. He agreed that the route was very confusing. The wardens were volunteers, a man and his wife who were just there for the week. They had spent all their holidays at youth hostels when their daughters were growing up and knew every one in the country, including Clun, which had been an old mill.   "
143,  
144,"   The geese were quite threatening, and I had to use all the assertiveness I'd learnt at dog-training to ward them off. (No, go away, bad goose!). Some people arrived with bags of food for them, then more people with dogs, and all the geese scattered. It was an easy ride to Chester from there, and as I came into the town, everything was bathed in golden light. There was a ferry across the river and people in boats. I pulled off the road to watch the activity. A little boy of about 10, all dressed in red and wearing a Ferrari cap, approached me. ""Wow!"" he said, ""Your tyres are really thin!"" I told him they were called ""slicks"" and were faster on the road. He said ""Cool!"" and we got into conversation. I ended up by asking if he liked Michael Schumacher, and he said yes, he really liked him! I'm sure he'd have been able to give me the results of the latest Grand Prix if I'd asked him. When I left, he said ""Nice to have met you.""    Chester has loads of wonderful buildings and a complete wall. The youth hostel was a beautiful 3-storey Victorian house across the river.
"
145,"  Before leaving Chester the next morning, I took a little time to see the city. It took me a while to find the route out of Chester. I had decided to make an interim stop at a B & B in Leigh because Slaidburn was 80 miles away. The road took me through a beautiful forest to Delamere. I crossed Acton Bridge, which had a sign indicating that it opened for river traffic to pass beneath it. I spent some time examining the bridge, trying to discover where the opening was, without success.    I asked a lady, walking her dog, which road to take to Leigh. She looked thoughtful and said it was a long, long way. I asked how far, and she said at least ten miles. I didn't tell her that I'd already come 60k, and that ten miles was a walk in the park. She then proceeded to give me such detailed and specific instructions; I wished she was writing the route schedules for the CTC. I wrote down what she said - ""Past the Jolly Thresher; first left and under a bridge to a T-junction; right past the Green Dragon; first left to a toll bridge; right at the end of the bridge; left at next T-junction to a roundabout; right past a garden centre on the right and on to a roundabout which would probably have a sign to Leigh."" Amazing lady! I asked how she remembered all that and she said she went that way often. So I followed all the directions and they were spot on. She was right, it was a long way. The bridge was an aqueduct and carried a canal. I was so surprised to see faces looking out of the barges as they passed, but couldn't take pictures because I was in a queue of one-way traffic. Not surprisingly, it was dripping under the bridge. The toll road went over the Manchester Ship Canal. I got out all my pennies to pay, but the friendly young man at the toll gate said there was no charge for bicycles.    After that, it was flat all the way to Leigh. Mrs. Fishwick's house was big and clean, but had nothing of the artistic expression of Mrs. Grassby's in Chepstow. There was a Southern fried chicken shop just up the road and I bought some for supper, and had a bath, my first for weeks. The youth hostels only have showers. I watched Big Brother on my private TV set. I had a very disturbed night. There was a lot of clattering and shouting at midnight while somebody loaded a car on to a flat-bed trailer outside my window. At 3 am an alarm went off, screaming inside my head. A guy rushing round with a cigarette in his mouth said it was the fire alarm, but didn't think there was a fire.
"
146,"When I went in for breakfast, the guy with the cigarette, and a young man in very dirty jeans, appeared briefly. Lorraine Fishwick appeared later and gave me directions to Bolton. There were gale-force winds predicted.  Soon after I started off, somebody called Dave stopped to chat, said he'd ride with me to see me out of town. He was wearing his End-to-End T-shirt, said he'd done it last year with a group, but 6 out of 8 had dropped out. I stopped in Bolton to look at the map, and asked a policeman where I was. Then I met another cyclist who stopped to chat. I decided to ditch the CTC route and follow the A roads because the rain and the wind were so awful, I just wanted to get there by the quickest route. Soon after leaving the cyclist, I stopped to look at the map, and it was whipped right out of my hands. I couldn't dump the bike to run after it, and I couldn't continue without it. Fortunately, it stuck behind a wall and I was able to retrieve it. I followed the Burnley road through a single row of opulent houses, past a school and past fields with stone walls. The wind was still blowing, but it had stopped raining. Finding Earby was no mean task as the road was inextricably entwined with the motorway, and I had no desire to repeat my experience on the motorway from the previous time I'd been in England.(I'd been picked up by the cops ""for my own safety"") With a lot of help from passers-by, I found Earby, a little village with a road twisting through it. The youth hostel was past some houses on Water Street , whose front doors had little bridges leading to them, over a stream. The youth hostel was a little stone house in a row of houses. The warden said they'd lost thousands this year because of Foot and Mouth Disease and were in dire straits. I went to Earby because Slaidburn, where I was supposed to go, was full.
"
147,"  The next day was a nightmare of battling a headwind. The CTC route didn't stop in the Lake District, but I loved Ambleside so much, I decided to make an unscheduled stop. The hills, the traffic and the wind combined to make the trip unbearable. It was a long way up the hill out of Earby. There were trees down across the road, and the road-clearing force was in action removing them. On the first part of the trip, the road was very narrow, and I had to get right off to let the lorries pass. I seemed to spend most of the day squashed against hedges and walls. On the broader roads, it was scary when the lorries passed. The wind and the turbulence made it difficult to keep my balance. The wind didn't let up, and sometimes, I even had to push downhill. The sun came out, and things started to go better. It was doing its best to make amends by shining brightly on the green trees. Most of the way after that was downhill and sheltered from the wind. I passed through Windermere and had my first glimpse of the lake. The youth hostel was next to the steam ferry landing in Ambleside.    There was a scene of bright happiness, young people in holiday mood, sitting on the verandah drinking coffee. My room was on the first floor overlooking the lake. It was too good to be true and made the whole day worthwhile. I sat in the window watching the sunset.   "
148,"  The wind hadn't abated during the night. The flag at the Steamer Pier was still at right angles to the pole. I nearly dropped my map in the lake. Oops! I only had a short distance to ride to Carrock Fell, but it wasn't as easy as I had predicted. I passed Grasmere, where the sun was still shining in patches from a leaden sky. I called in to take a picture of Dove Cottage which had belonged to Wordsworth, then rode the length of Thirlmere, with Helvellyn on my right. The road to Carrock Fell was steep and lonely with nothing in sight for miles. It was freezing and I was hungry. The voluntary warden, Sue, arrived just ahead of me. She had completed the ride from End-to-End the previous week, following the same route that I was using. She turned out to be a source of enormous help and support. Plotting my route for the next day, I discovered that my youth hostel handbook and map only covered England and Wales. I had nothing on Scotland, which I would be entering the following day. Like a magician, Sue produced a copy of each, which she said I could take. She said the road into Scotland was flat and smooth, and I could easily cover the 80 miles in a day. The steep hill to Wanlockhead at the end was quite manageable. So I decided to go for it. If I wasn't making it, there would be sure to be a choice of B & B's at hand. Penny phoned with the results of my blood test, which was normal.  I had been diagnosed with lymphoma, cancer of the bone marrow, in 1999. My oncologist, a cyclist himself, had fitted my treatments around my cycling, and I hadn't missed many of the major races.  Before I left for England, he was not satisfied with my blood test, and asked me to have another before I left on my cycle tour.  My cousin, Penny, arranged this for me, but I hadn't had the results by the time I started out from Land's End.  I had thought on occasions that my exhaustion had been because I was ""running out of steam"" as the doctor said I might, whereas now I could feel that maybe it was normal to feel tired at times. It gave me renewed vigour.
"
149,"Since my first stay in England years ago, I'd wanted to go to Gretna Green, the little house where marriages used to take place on the border between England and Scotland. I was overjoyed to see it right there on the road.     Annan was a bit of a disappointment. An old friend in Ladysmith (Mrs. Laing) had come from Annan. The clock tower made a good picture. As Sue had said, the road was flat and easy. I hardly changed out of my biggest gear all day. I phoned the hostel at Wanlockhead to say I'd be late. The warden said that the hostel closed for registration at 9, and the shop in the village closed at 8. It was cold and started to rain. The cars were using their headlights. I regretted not having brought my flashing tail light and my reflective delta sign. To my left, was a stream (burn) about 100 metres below the road, gushing and gurgling with green trees on either side.. At Mennock, I turned right and up the hill to Wanlockhead. There was no signal for my cell phone. It was getting darker and the hill was like Old Howick Road (an ""out-of-category"" climb for sure, leading north from my home in Pietermaritzburg) six miles of it! Sue was young and strong, did orienteering and adventure racing. What was easy for her, was a major mission for me. I passed a few isolated camps where the unhappy campers were struggling to start fires in the freezing rain. I started to wonder what I'd do if there wasn't a hostel at the top of the hill, or if it was closed. The scenery was remote and bleak, just empty hills on either side of the road. There was not a sign of life anywhere. By this time, I also had a headwind.  As if by a miracle, I came over a rise to a little village, orange lights glowing in the rain. Was it a mirage? The time was 22:30. I could hardly knock on doors asking where the youth hostel was. Another miracle revealed a youth hostel sign. The hostel was open and so was the office. There is a God after all! The wardens behaved as if the late arrival of cold, wet cyclists was a daily occurrence. A man took my bike and told me where the drying room was. Instead of a dormitory, I was given a little double room to myself. Thinking I'd have to cook my meal, I entered the dining room, where three fellows were just finishing their supper. Two were mining engineers prospecting for alluvial gold in the stream. The third was a hiker walking the 212 miles of Scotland Coast-to-Coast alone. They said they had some pasta and sauce left over from their supper, and would I like it? Boy, would I!! Wanlockhead, reputed to be the highest village in Scotland, is at the site of a disused lead mine. It boasted a museum, now closed because of Foot and Mouth Disease.
"
150,"  It was still raining when I woke up the next morning. I had become accustomed to the comfortable familiarity of England, and Scotland felt like a foreign country. The next destination on the route was Loch Lomond, which involved passing through Glasgow. Sue had warned me that the cycle path through Glasgow was littered with broken glass, and that she'd felt threatened by the presence of youths who had thrown rocks at her. She suggested the island of Arran as a possible alternative. Sitting there in my little bed in the hostel, the north of Scotland looked out of reach, and I wanted to go home. But having got to Scotland, that wasn't an option. Lanark was only 40 k away, so maybe I could limp to Lanark and make another plan from there. I walked around the village of Wanlockhead to see it in daylight. It came from another world - little cottages all at different levels and sheep rummaging in the bins in the street. At breakfast, I asked the miners about their method of prospecting, which involved the use of a pump similar to those used by fishermen on the beach. They suck up the sand from the stream and squirt it into a sieve, then examine it for gold-bearing rock. I asked if it was fun. One of them replied that he could just picture the look of pleasure on my face as I struggled uphill in the dark and freezing cold! Fun can also be standing in a stream in the rain, sucking up sand in a pump! When I left Wanlockhead, I decided that it was time to do something about my back brakes. There was far too much play in the lever. I asked a couple I passed whether there was a cycle shop in the village, and they said I wouldn't find anything till I reached Lanark. The girl went to fetch her brother, James, who knew something about bikes. The two men adjusted my brake cable and rotated the blocks through 180 degrees, advised me to get a proper repair in Lanark, but they felt so good after that, I was tempted to leave them as they were. It was downhill all the way to Lanark, about 40k. A little steam train passed in the distance, giving people rides from the station. High hills rose steeply from the road, with short, green grass and bleak, exposed rock, a few sheep grazing and many little gushing streams. It was beautiful in daylight, but had been threatening at night. The first shop I came to in Lanark was a cycle shop, and at 2.30pm on a Saturday, it was still open. William Withers was running a very busy shop. He was cheerful and efficient. He renewed the brake blocks and trued the back wheel, which he said had been buckled. The youth hostel at New Lanark was full, which meant I had to find a B & B. I found one at a riding school near Loch Lanark, the Scottish Equi Centre. It was a place which gave riding lessons to groups, mainly children, on the edge of a racecourse. I was almost the only guest. It was still drizzling, but all of Lanark was out enjoying the scenery at Loch Lanark. There were boats and swans and a children's playground. Riding from there, a man called out that my back tyre was flat. He'd given me such a fright that I fell on the road, my feet stuck in the cleats. He offered to help me change the tube, but I declined. William Withers, who'd pumped both tyres hard, was closed by then. Next door to him, Gordon's Repairs were still open and offered 7-day service. They offered me Tire Weld, which cost a fortune and didn't work, because my tyre was soft again the next day. Gordon's Repairs weren't open on the 7th day, so I used their nice flat surface to do what I should have done before, and changed the tube.
"
151,"After lunch, I was riding through the town when a car passed me and turned immediately left, as though I wasn't there. I saw the back mudguard an inch in front of my front wheel and myself lying in the road with a bent and buckled bicycle. I don't know why it didn't happen. The car drove into a road to the left, and I shouted and shook my fist. I hadn't gone far when a car pulled up next to me and the driver opened the passenger door. It was a man who said, ""I've just spoken to the young lady in that car, because she nearly killed you. She's very sorry and wanted to apologise, but I told her she' d better not. I'm a police officer."" The A 80 became a double carriage-way. Inside the white line were broken glass, steel bands and wire. The cars flashed and roared past, some much too close. It was a relief to turn off on to a minor road to Stirling.  The youth hostel, is a huge, old 3-storey building on the same level as the castle. I rushed off to see the castle while it was still light, and stopped at a little tourist shop where the assistant, a beautiful, tall girl in Scottish dress, must surely have been born and bred in Scotland. My theory was confirmed when I heard her speak, but I was wrong! She was from South Africa, and had only been in Britain since 1994. She was terribly home-sick, longed for boerewors, koeksusters and braaivleis, but most of all, boeremusiek and tiekiedraai (Afrikaans dishes, music and dancing). The view of Stirling from that level, with the late sun shining on it, was stunning. It was a panorama of gold and green, houses and roofs glistening in the fading sunlight.
"
152,"  The road from Stirling to Crianlarich took me through Callander where there was an exhibition in honour of Rob Roy, infamous cattle dealer who ran foul of his creditors. It started to rain just as I reached the youth hostel at Crianlarich, which is on the route of the West Highland Way. A lot of wet, muddy hikers arrived that night, and my dormitory was full. The leader of the group, Penny, was a professional hike leader and knew the area inside-out. She gave me some interesting information, about the routes and the history of the area. By this time, I was feeling more confident about reaching John O'Groats, and started to tell people that that was where I was going. Before that, I said I was hoping to, or trying to. Big Brother was hotting up. It was nearly time to decide on the winner. The youth hostel was full that night, and everybody congregated in the lounge to watch. It was a strong talking point and drew people together, or divided them, depending on their viewpoint. I was irritated by most of the participants, but loved to hate them.
"
153,"  I discovered that I was back on track for the CTC route, having diverted through Stirling and missed out Loch Lomond. The scenery through Glencoe was the most awesome I'd seen on the entire trip - massive, conical peaks on either side of the road, rivers, waterfalls, streams and lakes, the isolation and grand emptiness of it all. I rode up most of the hills and stopped often to take photographs. I wanted to remember it clearly in every detail. I wondered why nobody had ever told me that the Highlands of Scotland were so spectacular. I was so entranced that even the strong wind didn't depress me. I stopped to admire a perfect little stone dome which reminded me of the shepherds' huts at Sehlabathebe in Lesotho. A man and his wife were building a cairn next to it. The man told me that the cairn covered the ashes of his deceased mother. The stone dome had been built from the stone that was used for a hut during the filming of Rob Roy. The Glencoe youth hostel was on the right, through a forest of beautiful, green trees, the first trees I'd seen for miles. The key rings for the bicycle sheds at the youth hostels were always enormous, so that you couldn't put them in your pocket. The one at Glencoe was a builder's helmet. I asked the warden if I could borrow it to test the tube I'd changed in Lanark. She suggested I use a pot from the kitchen. When I said I didn't want to contaminate their cooking pot, she said she was sure that a lot of the stuff that goes into the pots contaminates them far more than my rubber tube would! I settled for the helmet and found no fault in my tube, not even the valve. That saved me buying a new one, and I continued to keep it as a spare. I sat outside the hostel till late that night, watching the light of the setting sun on the peaks high above.   "
154,"   Beyond Invermoriston, on the road to the Loch Ness Youth Hostel, I heard the sounds of bagpipes. The piper, in full Scottish dress, was standing on a derelict stone bridge off the road. Under the bridge was a complex waterfall, the water flowing in various directions. It was a magic scene. I felt as if I'd stepped on to the set of Brigadoon, and that if I came too close, he'd disappear.    At Loch Ness, my room was in the annex right next to the loch. Sadly, the ablutions overlooked the loch, and the dormitories faced the road. I had my supper on the beach, looking for the monster, and stayed there till it was almost dark and until the biting midges became unbearable.    I phoned Flo Taylor in Inverness, Jenny and Pat Coleby's daughter. Flo asked me to stay the following night. I had booked in at Carbisdale Castle, but it was a long way, and I didn't take much persuading. Besides which, I really wanted to see Flo and meet her family.
"
155,"  It was a short, easy ride to Inverness. It was cloudy, but not raining. I stopped to look at Urquhart Castle on the banks of the loch. It was surrounded by crowds of tourists. Later, as I was cruising down the road, my handlebar bag containing Pete's cell phone and my camera, shot off my handlebars and bounced on the ground. The only oncoming car avoided it.    There were other pipers on the shores of the loch, but these were obviously buskers.     I stopped at a shop in Drumnadrochit for film, and thought how much like swear words some of those Scottish names sounded. In Inverness, I phoned Flo from a Post Office, and Andrew came to fetch me in his white van decorated with blue bubbles, his window-cleaning ladders on top. At the flats, Bronwyn came flying out to meet us, with Tyson, the boxer at her heels. Flo gave me a dinner like I couldn't have imagined in my wildest dreams, certainly not anything I'd tasted in three weeks. It consisted of chicken, baked potato, peas, carrots and mushrooms followed by cherry pie and ice cream. It was all I could do to stop myself from licking the plate. She must have thought I'd been starving.  Then she took all my dirty clothes, and washed and dried them. She took me for a tour of the city in her smart black Discovery. By that time, it had started to rain, so I didn't see Inverness at its best, but I saw enough to discover what a beautiful city it was, on either side of the firth with an abundance of bridges and magnificent buildings. Back at home, Bronwyn, who's 5 ½, loved my map and spent a long time examining it for castles.
"
156,"   At Dingwall, there was an oil rig close to the shore. When I stopped for lunch, I was joined by another cyclist who was an End-to-Ender on the same route as me, Martin. We talked about the route, and were together at the three last youth hostels, although we didn't ride together. Two other cyclists and a yellow van went by. These were also on the route, with their support vehicle. We parted again. It was some time after this, that I saw a sign to a view site, where a number of tourists were gathered. It was like an aerial view over the lochs. By this time, the sun was shining and the lochs were blue. At the bottom of the hill, I followed signs to Culrain, through little stone villages and past streams , bright green trees made golden by the sun.  The youth hostel was at Carbisdale Castle. The gates were huge stone edifices immaculately built. The drive was lined by rhododendron bushes which must be spectacular in flower. When I reached the castle, I couldn't believe that this was my home for the night.      The castle inside was amazing. The huge room downstairs is filled with marble statues. The carpet in the entrance is tartan, as are the duvets on the beds. There were four other people in my dormitory, one of whom snored all night. I thought of Jim, intrepid cyclist and adventurer from Bellingham, who hates snorers. This was the only night out of 24 that I was disturbed by snoring.
"
157,"   The sun disappeared and the wind was cold. The hostel at Tongue was a double-storey house near the causeway. It wasn't open when I arrived and there was nowhere to shelter. When I registered, I made a comment about having done the ride without sherpas or bottled oxygen, a reference to Goran Kropp, the Swede who'd ridden from Stockholm to Kathmandu and climbed Everest unassisted. I didn't realise that this was an issue with End-to-End, but heard Martin talking to his friend that night, saying it was important to him to ride without assistance, to carry everything he needed himself. There had been times when I'd longed to ride without the burden of panniers and with other people, but I felt quite proud when I heard Martin's point of view. Our dormitory upstairs was a wonderful surprise. We had a view over the kyle (lake) to the mountains behind. These mountains reminded me of the Cape mountains. That night at Tongue was really terrible. There was a gale-force wind screaming all night, and an annual Tongue celebration on the causeway kept a loud band playing till 2.30 am.   "
158,"   After Reay, I started to go like the wind and eat up the miles. Dunnet Head, although not the furthest point from Land's End, is the northernmost. It's six miles off the road, but obviously, I had to make the diversion, because I might not be that way again. There were other cyclists on the road with heavily laden bicycles.    At Dunnet Head, there's a lighthouse and a map showing its position. Returning to the road was slightly easier because it was downhill, but I still had to pedal to make progress against the wind. The ride to John O'Groats was beautiful. I didn't want it to end. The sun had emerged from the clouds, making the countryside golden. I was sad that the ride was nearly over. There were fields with sheep and cows, bales of hay and little stone houses, the ferries to the Orkneys, and suddenly, the sign to Canisbay Youth Hostel. The warden's name was Patricia-I'm-here-to-help-you. A couple came into the kitchen in cycling shorts, and the man said, ""Hoe gaan dit? Het jy goed gery?"" (How are you?  Did you have a good ride?) I gaped in astonishment. He was South African, living in Maidenhead, and he and his girlfriend were going to start the ride in the opposite direction the following day. I would love to have gone with them. Cycle touring is addictive, and it's hard to give up the nomadic life, return to tin cans speeding on the motorway, rush and responsibility.   "
159,"   I envied Greg and Mandy when they left. It was strange not to be riding off. I had to wait for the Tourist Information Centre to open at 10. I obtained a train time table from them, and phoned Patricia to ask her not to lock up, I'd be there in 10 minutes. But there was a head wind, and when I reached the youth hostel, it was locked and there wasn't a soul in sight. I hadn't finished packing, and Patricia still had my youth hostel card and certificate. When I phoned, there was an answering machine saying that the hostel would only open at 5. The wind was blowing hard and there were drops of freezing rain. Maybe I didn't envy Mandy and Greg all that much after all. Patricia strolled nonchalantly by with letters to post. Pete's cell phone chose that moment to run out of credit. It wasn't surprising. I think he'd put all his savings into it, but I'd used it so much. I rode back to the TIC at JOG, and they gave me the number of a taxi to phone. The dear man answered straight away, and my luck took a turn for the better. He would pick me up in 10 minutes and could get me to the station at Thurso before the train left at 12.35. He came with a van and loaded my bike. He'd lived in John O'Groats all his life and had been in the Merchant Navy till he retired three years ago. He gave me the history of the place, told me about the crops we passed, showed me where the Queen Mother's castle was, pulled into the station at the same time as the train and watched to see that I got on. It was a long day and night, and I was still in my cycling gear. We changed at Inverness and again at Edinburgh, where my bike was in the guard's van, on a bracket on the wall in wheelie position. At 7 in the morning we pulled into Euston, from where I found my way to Paddington and the train to Maidenhead. The end.   "
160,"At this point in our life we were just looking to do it because it was out there.  We hadn't done a lot of research.  We just thought it would be a great experience.  Two years went by, I had sort of forgot our dream of biking across the country and Ryan was planning on getting married.                  Then Bob called me up in May of 2003 and said, ""Still want to bike across the country?"" I said, ""Why not?"" We immediately began planning.  It was a good thing we started planning for our trip over a year in advance because we really didn't know much about biking let alone biking across the country.  Ryan and his wedding took him out of the picture.  It was down to me and Bob.   Thank god for the Internet because it has a wealth of information.  Adventure Cycling was also an amazing source of information for this trip.  Another bit of advice is to spend hours reading journals of other people who have done it before.  I learned so much from reading journal after journal.  This trip would have also been impossible without the help of the guys over at the Peddlers Shop ( http://peddlershop.com ) in Deptfor, New Jersey.   "
161,"On that fateful day we also decided that if we were riding across the country we should also try to raise money for a good cause. We got in contact with several charities and finally picked Oxfam. Oxfam is a nonprofit organization which seeks to end social injustice and hunger in American and around the world.  Unfortunately the economy has been down and big coorperations are not very interested in donating to grass root charities like us. As of April of 2004 we raised a little less then $3000 for Oxfam.

211,"Five visits to the Gulag Bark-ipelago, and we were the nervous, neophyte owners of a scared young dog, a mix, we were later to find, of Australian cattle dog and border collie.  Jodi suggested we call him Django after the famous jazz quitarist, Django Rheinhardt.  The name seemed to suit him.  So Django it was.    How would we EVER tour with a good-sized dog like this?  He was almost full grown when we adopted him, tipping the scales at 55 lbs.  I brooded.  Our touring days were over.  Who does long distance cycling with a dog?  He's not a  Saint Bernard, but, dang it, 55 lbs. is a solid touring load.  What to do?  Give up touring, I guess. Jodi was more persistent and creative.  Why not get a trailer?  Why not teach Django to run alongside the trike?  Why not at least try?  And so the little training runs began.  We sold the Burley Nomad trailer and replaced it with a single child carrier version, the Solo.  We removed the child's harness  and installed cables and a clip to keep the new hound from jumping ship.  A series of short training runs around our home in the mountains of the southern Sierras of California followed. To our delight and surprise, the boy seemed to take to the whole enterprise rather well.  He especially liked trotting alongside.  Jodi, as stoker, would mind his leash.  Mostly she just set it to an appropriate length and slipped it over the righthand bar.  Django then fit neatly between us and ran on the shoulder or white line, whatever the road provided.  He quickly developed an intense love for these workouts and learned to just snap into position whenever Jodi would take the stoker's position on the trike. Riding in the trailer was a slightly different matter.  Django is a dog who hardly ever barks or makes a sound of any sort except a playful groan or two.  He might go a couple of weeks without a bark.  His first rides in the trailer produced a veritable song--yips, barks, yakking of all sorts.  Wow, so  the pooch had a voice after all.  But what was the deal with the trailer?  Hmmm.... Curiouser and curiouser.  Now, after over four weeks of touring, Django sings less often, but when the mood is on him, usually earlier in the day, he can really lay down the tunes.  At first we were concerned that he was frightened or upset, but his ears were up; he was looking around.  We had to trust that he would adapt. The next logical step would be a tour, a shakedown of some sort.  A break in my spring semester gave us the window we needed, and a four day/three night tour through the wilds of San Louis Obispo county proved to us it could be done.  Django could sure put up an annoying racket sometimes, but occasionally he quieted down.  We had to hope this would occur more often.  Our technique was to let Django walk up all the hills, occasionally trot and run the flats, and ride the descents and other flats.  Being a very athletic dog, he was more than happy to take to the road when we let him.  Given his attitude, we figure the guy would run himself into a coma if we let him. This new style of riding necessitated some changes:  We had to expect to cover fewer miles (maybe a good thing), and we had to be patient while the dog adapted to this mode of travel--and patient with ourselves.  Many, many times a day, depending on terrain, we needed to stop, unclip, put dog into trailer or let him out.  The day's travel could feel herky-jerky sometimes, especially if the route were really undulating with short descents followed by hills of sufficient steepness that we couldn't pull the dog.  Any grade over 3% usually meant unloading Django unless it was very short.  Long climbs and descents didn't feel too different than pre-dog.  The flats were a pleasant surprise.  We could cook right along and hardly noticed the extra load, except, of course, for the yips and yaps.   Our touring load was prodigous.  Sixty pounds, give our take, for our personal gear, about twenty pounds for trailer and dog food and assorted doggie items, and the vital fifty-five pounds of the royal pooch himself.  Yoiks!  All cyclists, especially touring cyclists, are familiar with the post-drop depression, that moment when momentum gives way to upward slope and the pull of gravity, and the sweet swish of easy speed is dragged from us, 30 mph to 3mph in no time.  With Django, this phenomenon was severely amplified.  The extra drag of the trailer tires, the extra load, the fact that I had to carefully restrict the speed of descents to keep the trailer under control (Django likes to move back and forth in the trailer a bit)--all this meant that when we hit a climb right after a descent, our forward velocity tanked.  Often, of course, this meant stopping, unclipping, letting the dog out of the trailer and resuming the ascent.  Django was always a wagging, happy super mutt when we let him out, always ready to go for the gold.  Long climbs necessitated careful monitoring of heat, time spent climbing and/or distance so that all members of the team got sufficient rest, water, the usual.   Footnotes: One particular worry was Django's paws.  Could he handle the miles?  At first, we experimented with different brands of booties, but we found these easily chaffed him, the prevention seeming worse than the problem.  We found, however, that Django had developed super paws and didn't need extra protection.  He tended to trot on the white line, which was cooler and smoother, and we gave him plenty of breaks.  Our uphill speeds were fantastically slow, too, so excessive wear on his pads was minimized.  We carried booties, just in case, but only used them once, probably unnecessarily. Our spring tour went well, and we had a fantastic time.  Our daily mileage averaged 20--45 miles, about what I had hoped.  We realized quickly, however, that with longer summer days and less mountainous terrain, we could cover over 50 miles per day without undue stress.   We could tour with Django the Wonder Dog.  What remained was to set an objective for the rapidly approaching summer vacation.  Our rather loose goals were to have some fun and cover at least 500 miles, a new record for us for any kind of touring. Style note:  I've decided to keep the tenses I used while writing in my journal on the road in order to maintain a more immediate feel.  I wasn't able to post this from the road, but I did want to keep the feel of such writing, so I've worked pretty closely from my hand-written journal without too much desire to edit.  I hope you like the results.  (Note from the stoker:  I've also added entries straight from my journal, inserting them where I think they add more information or an interesting counterpoint to Scott's experience.)   "
212,"The horror and the glory.  Though we had  ridden  a long section of Hwy 89 before, it had been during 4th of July weekend, a  poor choice to be sure, but, except for a few sections, and foolishly riding on  late  Sunday afternoon, we didn't have  too much trouble.  What we had not then and did not now consider was the truck traffic and, we later discovered, the big increase in logging and the shutting down of a key mill.  The net result was, in places, some of the worst truck traffic we had ever experienced.  Grim-faced drivers bearing down on us, engine brakes rattling like heavy machine gun fire, no shoulder, wide trike.  You get the picture. As a result of this traffic and other considerations that I will explain later, we ended up not returning to Mt. Shasta but heading south and west to the coast,  north to Eureka and finally south again to finish just outside of Garberville in a town called Redway, the nearest U-Hual truck rental agency after Avenue of the Giants Overall, this route meant business.  We climbed in the Sierras, the Cascades, the Marbles, the Trinities, and the coastal mountains, pass after pass after pass--strenuous, glorious country.  After we left Mt. Shasta, the traffic was rarely a problem, and we thoroughly enjoyed the riding, even with the sweaty, grinding climbs.       "
213,"  When one rides a recumbent, one is a freak.  When one rides a recumbent trike, one is a serious freak.  When one rides a tandem recumbent trike towing a dog in a trailer, one is a serious freaky geek from another planet.  Wherever we show up, we're the circus come to town, the May Day Parade, a real happening.  Our trike has been called ""sick,"" ""phat,"" and ""one pimp ride."" This kind of attention can be fun, but it can also be extremely tiresome.  All touring cyclists have to deal with the ""Howfaryoucome?"" and ""Whereyouheaded?"" questions.  These get tiresome as well.  On top of that, we had to regularly field questions about cost, who built it (not me), how many gears, etc.  At the end of a long, hard day, sometimes these were just too much, and I could be a little short with folks.  To anyone who felt cut off, I apologize. I'll cover briefly some of the typical questions here: 1) Where did you get it?  Greenspeed of Australia is one of the oldest, most respected manufacturers of recumbent trikes in the world.  Dealers can be found all over.  Check out the website: http://www.greenspeed.com.au/ 2) How much did it cost?  We tend to feel a bit touchy about this question and often just say ""a lot,"" but when I was dealing with cycling enthusiasts or other people from whom I just got a good ""vibe,"" I sometimes gave them the real numbers.  Keep in mind, these trikes are made by a small company in a free country and are shipped across the Pacific.  Currently, prices for a tandem equipped as ours come to about $7,000.  We got ours for about $6,000.  What#$$@$^^%%^#$?! You say?  One woman asked if it cost more than $500.  Most folks just have no clue what fine tools cost.  When most people see slave-labor-produced bikes at X-Mart for $49.95, the idea of spending thousands on a ""toy"" just sends them to the nearest emergency room.  For us, however, this cycle is a vehicle of discovery, a fitness center, a shopping vehicle, a marital aid, and more.  When riding a country road, being passed by a $250,000 RV towing a $70,000 SUV (the combined rig averaging about 4mpg), we have some moments of WHAT%$#%&*@?! ourselves, especially when gas is now over $2/gallon most places.  So value and cost are pretty relative concepts.  We consider our tandem trike an RV for the aerobically insane. 3) How does it climb?  Slowly.  If hill-climbing speed is central to your touring mind set, skip recumbent trikes, especially tandems.  We had a monster load, so we were extra special slow.  The great advantages of a trike are important, however: no matter how slow, you can't fall over so no stress worry or effort exerted keeping upright; truck turbulence, wind, etc., have less destabilizing effects.  Our speeds otherwise were fine, comparable to most loaded tandems.  We can cruise flats in the low to mid-teens (mph) comfortably. 4)  Is it comfortable?  Of course!  Your favorite lawn chair on wheels.  Sometimes our butts would get a little sore but absolutely nothing compared to the agonies of the damned I've suffered on conventional bikes.  With the relatively high placement of the pedals, however, we do get some numb or tingly toes from time to time.  A few moments off the bike cures this, and we're ready to go.  Not everyone has this problem.  The key point with riding recumbents is to give yourself plenty of time to adjust. For more technical information on the trike, spend some time on the Greenspeed site or do an internet search under recumbent bicycle.  There is a wealth of information out there.  Other makers of recumbent trike tandems include WizWheelz (USA), Organic Engines (USA), which makes a pretty affordable travel tandem--maybe our next! and ICE (UK)  With recumbents in general but especially tandem trikes, make sure you get super low gears, like in the 10 to 12 gear inch range if you intend to ride mountains with a load. The rest of our gear was standard bike touring/back packing stuff--tent, pads, bags, tools.  We carried two extra tires but didn't need them (only had one flat), and we carried two pumps in case one failed.  We were often in very remote locations and couldn't depend on available services.  For these reasons, we didn't carry a cell phone either.  It would have been useless most of the time.  I'll be happy to answer any other questions if you get to me directly through the guest book.
"
214,"Beginnings are loaded moments--excitement, uncertainty, fear.  Will we make it?  Will Django?  How will the weather be? Too hot?  We had planned as carefully as we dared, and all that was left was to let the journey unfold, face it, cross the threshold and commit.  This ragged edge of the continent gave us pause (paws?), but, afterall, that was the point: to face something we hadn't faced before, push ourselves, discover something.  As Campbell put it, the outward journey is always an inward trek as well.  Our main objectives were exploration and enjoyment, the finding of joy, but ""enjoyment"" for us has almost always meant a good deal of mental, physical, and spiritual straining, our rewards usually a product of sustained muscular effort.  For as long as I can remember, I've been this way, and Jodi, from a non-athletic, non-outdoors family has had the same leanings, always drawn to the outdoors, the wild side of things.  She is unable to explain how she ended up like this but believes she found in herself a connection to nature that we all share but that some, too many, have lost. We took to the mountains without motors or air conditioners or heaters.  We averaged less than ten miles per hour and saw every blade of grass, every rock and beer can as we inched up the big passes.  It suited us just fine.  And Django the Wonder Dog?  He'd rather run than eat.  A natural born nut-case.  Perfect. I dread the packing, but I love the beginnings, the edge of expectation and casting off."
215,"We are camped now in Sandy Beach, $20 for a patch of dirt and a picnic table, upon which I now write, and a steady rumble and rush of traffic along the lake.  Not ideal, but the trees are tall; the breeze is cool, and we get hot showers, too.  We skipped the expensive restaurant, Spindleshanks, near the campground and ate at Sanchos down the road--very blah Mexican. It feels really good to be underway, the first big climb completed.  Django hiked the ten miles to Spooner summit in a state of near boredom, or so it seemed.  We stopped at a bike shop near Spooner Lake, and Django played like crazy for a full half hour with a puppy the owners had tied up in the back.  Then, just a while ago, he ran like crazy with some other dogs on the beach.  His energy and stamina leave us shaking our heads.   Tomorrow we'll ride Hwy 89 and the Truckee river and skip the big climb over Brockway summit.  We'll get a nice stretch of bike path, too.         "
216,"   In town, we parked in the shade of the visitors' center and ate lunch on a nice bench with a fine few of the classic, brick-faced buildings.  We marveled at the clear day and cool temperatures when a fully-loaded backpacker stopped for a chat, intrigued by the bike and the obvious panniers and trailer.  His name was Zeke, and he was hiking the PCT (Pacific Crest Trail), Mexico to Canada, though he was far ahead of any other hiker this year, which had forced him to skip some sections due to heavy snow.  He vowed to return and hike these later in the season.  For now he was still heading north.  It turns out he had hiked the Appalachian Trial with an extension to the tip of Florida, seven and half months of walking.  His PCT hike, however, was tinged with sadness.  He was hiking it in the memory of his recently killed wife who had died in February when a drunk driver hit their car in Las Vegas.  He said, ""Sometimes, at night, I'm sittin' by the fire, and I feel her there.  She's with me, all the time.  She told me before she died she wanted me to do this hike.""  Zeke wandered off, and Jodi and I looked at each other, grateful. After some chocolate almond fudge ice cream, we faced a couple of long, hot climbs.  Although the air temperature wasn't bad, in the direct sun, grinding slowly up a grade of blacktop....  We took a break at a reservoir to wait out the worst of the heat.  On our way out, we pulled too hard on a section with Django in the trailer and got a bit wasted, but from the top, we dropped into the Little Truckee river drainage--green meadows washed in long afternoon light. Now we're camped beside that river; the stove putters away; the tent is pitched.  I can't wait to eat.  Tomorrow will be beautiful.  I could use an easier day. THE STOKER'S 2 CENTS:  I love the area we're in.  Tall narrow pines, their green spires piercing the blue.  The sweetish odor of Jeffrey's floating on the wind.  Glimpses of creeks, lakes, rivers, their waters exerting a strong pull on me.  The counterpoint is the traffic bearing down on us--in clots, not a steady stream.  Most motorists show courtesy and give us plenty of room.  The few who don't scare me, make me want to commit murder and mayhem.  How dare they not use common sense (which, of course, is not so common).  How dare they threaten our lives.  And even when it's not feeling so dangerous, the traffic is just plain noisy, deafening sometimes, detracting from the quiet beauty around us.  I get thrown off center by the shattering noise of internal combustion engines, the engine brakes on the trucks and by the concussive forces when they pass by too closely.  Do I really feel my life is threatened?  I don't think so.  I'm not aware of feeling afraid right now, only angry.   "
217,"Once we crawled out of the tent, Django went into overdrive mode, turbos blazing, running all over the place, circles, figures of eight, spins.  Jodi coined an expression for this morning routine:  Coffee and donuts.  I make coffee; Django runs donuts.  The hot drinks were welcome this morning--cold.  Jodi had a hard time warming up her toes.  We lingered and waited for the day to warm and saw strange trucks loaded down with circus rides and related gear rumble by.    At the top of our first big descent to Sierraville, we took a break and were approached by a woman who pulled over and wanted to take our picture.  Diane bubbled over with enthusiasm at what we were doing.  She had seen us earlier, and she and her daughter had been talking a lot about us.  She offered us a place to stay, showers, the works.  Our first road angel of the trip.  We thanked her profusely, but the day was young, and we'd be riding some distance beyond her home in Calpine.  After a nice chat and photo session, we headed our separate ways.  We zoomed down miles of cool curves shaded by pines and swept out into the open at Sierraville.  This is a beautiful stretch of road through classic small towns, wide-open fields.    We rode easily and joyfully across to Calpine.  What followed there was another big climb, much harder than we remembered from two years before--but the descent was better too.  We were grinning and laughing out loud by the time we bottomed out--a dream of sweet curves and easy speed.  We had lunch in a stand of pines and dozed on a thick bed of fallen needles, a cloudy sky offering relief from the warm sun. In Graeagle, a resort town, we discovered that Cinderella had lost her slipper, one half of a very expensive pair of Teva sandals, still pretty new.  Argh.  We had neglected to tighten down the lid that held the pair in place.  We were not about to ride back and look for it.  Cheapo flip flops at the local mercantile would have to suffice. We had originally planned to stay in Graeagle, but something urged us on.  The day was not old, and we still had plenty of energy.  Saddle up, move 'em out.  Later that afternoon, we had a most incredible encounter.  As we were sweating up a long climb and thinking about a campsite in Cromberg, a man in a pickup swung off the road just in front of us and jumped out.  We expected another ""Can I take your picture?"" kind of an encounter, but instead, Bruce asked us if we were looking for a place to camp.  Well, yes.  ""My wife and I have six acres in Cromberg, and we'd be happy to let you camp there.""  Road angel number 2.  We couldn't refuse.  He gave us directions.  Bruce is a chiropractor in Quincy, and his wife Linda is something of a homeopath and helps him in his practice.  We rolled onto their wonderful property and were treated with incredible hospitality: showers, dinner, breakfast--organic!  Fantastic conversation AND they had a wonderful, huge malmute/husky/wolf(?) mix that loved playing with Django.  Bear had a ""woo! woo!"" sort of bark and weighed 130 lbs.  We were so stunned and thankful for their generosity.  Jodi asked Linda if they had ever done anything like this before, but Linda said no; Bruce just thought that it would be the right thing to do.  Thank you, thank you, thank you, Bruce, Linda and Bear!   "
218,"  We rest now to escape the heat of the afternoon.  Indian Creek rushes nearby.  This has been a tough day.  The heavy truck traffic has really worn us down.  Eighty thousand pounds of raging semi can be a bit trying on sweaty, weary cyclists.  We get plenty of room, for the most part, when people pass, but we're fed up.  We've made a big mistake, and I can tell the situation is taking its toll on Jodi.  We've just got to hang on and get through this section.  I certainly can't recommend Hwy 89 for bike touring--though at other times of the year, things might not be so bad.  We are now resolved, however, not to retrace our route.  Just before stopping by the creek, a CHP officer pulled us over to have a few words and tell us that he'd been getting a lot of calls from angry truckers, who, it appears, believe they own the road.  The officer also said that some car drivers had told him that what we were doing was ILLEGAL.  He told one and all to relax and that we had just as much right to the road as they did.  The problem with the truckers in particular was that they drive this highway all the time and know how far above the speed limit they can take every blind corner.  When they turn a corner and see us, horror of horrors, they have to slow down.  Life delivers some bitter, bitter blows.  I guess having to slow down for a couple of cyclists is one of them.  We saw truckers waving their fists at us, flipping us the sign of the double bird--such sweet, understanding, happy people.  United we stand brother.  Merry Christmas and get the hell out of my way.  As I think about the job these blokes do, I realize why they were so angry.  Sitting all day in those blasting, rattling, booming vehicles, driving the same stretch of road again and again...sounds like a special circle of hell to me.   It's really a shame.  This is some fantastic country.  Rivers, mountains, canyons, forests--all of it ruined for cyclists because of the traffic.  We are determined in the future to research routes more carefully, calling highway patrol offices to find out traffic loads, shoulders, etc. So we wait out the heat and hope that truck traffic will taper off later in the afternoon.  It's impossible to beat these guys in the morning as they start well before sunrise, like 4--5am. (See what I mean about hell?)  But the bright, clear sun ignites the pines; the wind bends the willows into silver waves along the creek.   Yin and yang, brother, yin and yang. THE STOKER'S 2 CENTS:  This section of road, to the Paxton turnoff where 70 and 89 part company, got narrow and twisty as it wound along high above the Feather River.  Logging trucks, full and empty, bore down on us with astonishing regularity, as did cars and RVs.  Truckers always gave us wide berth, but once again the noise and the proximity of so many huge machines was stressful.  Why couldn't I just relax and enjoy the views as much as Scott seemed to be doing?  The CHP officer's explanation of the dangers of our situation was mighty convincing to me, if not to Scott.  Scott thinks the drivers (those who complained) overestimate the danger.  Hwy. 44 is supposed to be much better, and I hope it is, because so far this isn't the fun I'd been looking forward to.
"
219,"The camp outside town was well shaded and almost empty--nice.  We've got a short day tomorrow. THE STOKER'S 2 CENTS:  Campground is 2 miles north of town in an obviously thinned stand of trees--standard issue Forest Service campground.  But big.  And empty.  Creek a little ways away.  Cooked a late dinner (the previous night) but a good one:  pinto beans, salsa, brown rice, spinach, cheese--a new classic.  Took ibuprofen and slept well.  I felt comatose when I woke this morning.  Django slept almost all day and didn't even have enough energy to play with some other doggies at the campground.  Tonight's dinner:  parsley-garlic fettucine noodles with garlic shoots, zucchini, dried mushrooms and tomatoes, olive oil, and peccorino.  Kale dressed with olive oil, garlic and salt as appetizer.  Mmmmmmmmmm.   "
220,"   The long, gradual climb to Lake Almanor was a pleasure.  The morning was bright and cool, and, being Sunday, psycho truckers were off duty.  Django was in a fine, focused mood, and we made good time, sweating a bit when we hit direct sun.  For long stretches, we had the road to ourselves.  The snow covered flanks of Mt. Lassen and nearby high country stood out clearly this morning, and a bracing wind followed us into Westwood, where we had to spend the night in order to pick up a package we'd shipped ahead--dog food, goodies, a care package. At a nice-looking inn built by a founding timber baron in the previous century, we had coffee and asked about a room--$90.00!  But when the manager found out we had a dog, even our $90 wouldn't cut it.  No dogs allowed.  The manager was a very nice woman and owned dogs herself, so she really sympathized  with  our plight.  We went outside to eat lunch and contemplate what to do.  Before we could eat, the manager had come out and said that if we slipped in quietly after she closed the cafe, we could have a room.  Road angel number 3, please accept your trophy at the door.  We got a beautiful pine-paneled room on the west side, second floor, and parked the trike in a screened-in porch. A shower, fine sheets, a comfortable bed, golden evening light pouring through lace curtains.        We cooked  dinner outside,  intoxicated by the bright Sierra light--oops--no, we had  now crossed into the Cascades.   A couple of local cyclists stopped by and told us that our route for tomorrow was excellent.  At last, trustworthy intel from fellow cyclists. Rule number one of the road:  Never trust riding information from people who  don't ride. I love this pine and fir-covered land and could live here easily.  Somehow, I don't see it happening.  My job will keep us in Kern county far to the south for many years to come.  I love my job  and the people down there, but, ugh, the summer pollution.  At least we are so free to travel.
"
221,"We headed north up Lassen county route A21, a fantastic corridor through the pines, rolling and climbing, rolling and climbing.  We let Django run along for the first few miles.  A scattering of clouds marked a sky of heart-breaking clarity.  The route produced one false summit after another, but we didn't push the pace.  We had almost no traffic.  This was to savor, what we had come for.  On Hwy 44, turning NW, the temperature sharpened, the breeze quickened.  We crossed wide basins of sage dotted with lupine; swifts and hawks cut the stiffening wind; clouds gathered on all fronts, especially to the north.  Traffic was heavier, but we all eventually had to stop for road work.  After a ten minute wait, we followed the string of vehicles behind the pilot car and fell further and further behind.  We pushed hard to get out of the way, and when we crossed the line beyond the construction,  workers at the end cheered us on.      A few miles past the construction, we turned down a dirt road to look for a place to camp, Butte Creek Rd., which follows the creek (duh) that drains from the Mt. Lassen wilderness, lost in the gathering gloom and doom of the storm.  We pedaled a mile or two down this road and pulled into the forest not too far from the creek.  We finished cooking and dove into the tent just as the storm cut loose, pounding rain and fat, spongy hail.      Now it's 6:30pm.  The precipitation comes down in waves over our little camp.  Django is curled up at my feet, dead out from all the excitement and a full belly.  We are a content and cozy trio set here in the woods.  For now, this weather is a gift, a joy.  If it rains all day tomorrow, I'll complain for sure.  But for now, I'll just enjoy it.  Time to stretch out and read a little.
"
222,"   We plunged off the edge and into one of the best descents of my experience--clouds, forests, snow clad mountain all opening out in an awesome sweep.  At the bottom, we pulled over to check out the lava ""Subway"" tunnel, a couple of hundred yards of high ceilings and perfect, arched walls, high domed rooms, totally, utterly dark inside.  We turned off our flashlight and sank into the doom of the gloom in the tomb.      We needed to resupply, and a hot shower would be very nice, so Burney was the destination for the day: the Green Gables Motel (nice), ah! showers, take-out Chinese, beer, and annoying TV. THE STOKER'S 2 CENTS:  Fair amount of rain Monday night, and it got cold.  Pannier covers encrusted with patches of ice in the morning and didn't melt any too soon.  Got my feet wet walking through the grasses.  Feet froze to my heels, and I consequently couldn't warm up til I took my shoes off at the Subway Cave.  From there I was warm and could enjoy the ride, though the previous descent off the Hat Creek Rim was beautiful.  Back on Hwy. 89 traffic was easy because of the roadwork on 44; it came in pulses.  Some of my favorite landscape is along this stretch:  volcanic rock formations, manzanita and redbuds predominating.  Open spaces with farms and ranches.  Good vistas.   "
223,"   Shortly after arriving at Burney Falls State Park, another CHP officer informed us that truckers were screaming at him about our being on the road.  The officer was great and told the truckers to relax, that we had just as much right to the road as they did.  The animosity of these truckers was amazing and disheartening.   The rangers were fun and very excited about what we were doing, and one of them, Andy, had read all the works of Edward Abbey, one of my favorite authors.  On hearing our plans, Andy offered to give us a ride to bypass some of the nasty sections of 89 up ahead, but we declined.  We'd made it this far.  So we ate lunch and headed out...into a big mistake.  We quickly got into narrow, shoulderless corners, steep climbs, and the truck traffic had picked right up--more machine gun fire and scowling faces.  We stood in a pullout and shook with the rumble and roar.  Sure we had just as much right to the road; sure the truckers were supposed to give us room.  Sure.  All it would take, however, was one angry nutcase, one guy who'd been dumped by his girlfriend the night before and guzzled too many beers...all it would take would be one miserable soul who wanted to teach us a lesson, maybe just ""scare"" us a bit.  We could be right, we could be dead right, we could just be dead.  Rights don't count for much when you're road kill.  We turned and pedaled like crazy through the tight sections and back to the park.  Ranger Andy, sir, we would love to take that ride! These rangers, Andy and Shirley, were super road angels.  The next morning Andy would drive us to McCloud, where the road widened and provided shoulders, and Shirley would give us bran muffins!     We met some other amazing people, too: a 91-year-old jokester who just kept us laughing.  Zeke, the widower PCT hiker was there (I guess doing more hitching than actual hiking at this point), and a very friendly and super experienced cyclist, John.  John cooked dinner with us, and we chatted about routes, cycling, life--a wonderful time.  When I lamented to John that the lack of beer at the store was a drag, a nearby camper promptly brought three over! Good, cold micro brews, too.  Road angel, we thank you again. THE STOKER'S 2 CENTS:  Had a long, animated nutrition discussion with ranger Shirley and one of her co-workers.  Shirley's lively, intelligent, curious, open-minded.  I liked her immensely, and I sure needed the female company.   Scott went off early in the evening in search of beer and returned, instead, with another cycle tourist named John. Experienced cyclist with loads of info to impart, since he'd just come from the area to which we're headed. Based on his experiences we're altering our plans, foregoing some of the river routes because they afford virtually no river access.     Dinner:  Whole wheat fusilli, canned salmon, fresh asparagus, dressed with olive oil, lemon juice, asiago.  Good food journey so far.
"
224,"Faster than we could click our jeweled cycling shoes three times, we unloaded and assembled the trike in McCloud, a fine little town at the foot of Mt. Shasta.  We thanked Andy profusely for his ""visitor assist,"" as he put it,  and  off he went.   We were immediately impressed by McCloud, a fine little mill town with classic buildings.  The day was cool with a scattering of clouds though the great Mt. Shasta, over 14,000ft. high, was largely obscured.  We did a short trike tour of the town, Django quiet for once in the trailer, and we hit the road for the last of 89, which was, of course, a big climb to Snowman Hill Pass (4,400ft).  The day was not hot, but we sweated hard just the same.  As we'd been told, the road did have a shoulder, and that made all the difference.  The route was noisy and unpleasant, but it was a lot safer and less stressful.    From the top of the pass, we had a steady, spectacular five mile descent to the town of Mt. Shasta, one of the nicest of our tour: cafes, two natural food stores, a great outdoor shop where Jodi replaced her sandals, an excellent bakery.  Yep, we'd move there tomorrow if we could.  It won't happen, but it's fun to dream.  I suppose I'm a lot like my father, searching for the ""perfect"" place, paradise NOW, not in the hereafter.  Most of us never find that place.  Even my father's last best place was a compromise.  He always wanted ""to shoot off the back porch,"" as he put it, and he didn't get that--not that my mother would have tolerated blasting away next to the house like that anyway.   So we cruised the streets of Mt. Shasta on a cool June afternoon.  We bought a loaf of basil, garlic, Parmesan bread at the bakery and ate it with cheese and avocado while sitting on a bench in front.  We were bombarded by the usual litany of questions.  One fellow fired off the usual ""How far you gone?"" but didn't even bother to slow down.  Did the jerk want an answer or what?  His question was completed as he was facing away from us and marching down the sidewalk.  Creep.         Now I sit at a picnic table in a KOA campground just outside town.  By stepping through the trees, we can get a grand view of the snow plastered peak rising, clear now, for 10,000 feet above.  The trees stand close around our camp; the wind sighs in the branches and blows cool across my neck.  An occasional train trumpets through town, out of sight.  I feel relaxed and high from the hot shower and exercise,  the sight  of golden snow in the evening light, the  knowledge that a whole new phase of the tour is at hand.  I  sip warm spiced tea, contented.  At long, bloody last, Hwy 89 is behind us.  Tomorrow, it's secondary roads all the way to Yreka.  Time to finish my tea and watch the last light on the peak.
"
225,"     We rolled into Yreka at about 2pm, ate lunch, and almost didn't get our package of food from the post office because all government services were closed due to Reagan's death--arrrgh.  But when we looked around the back, one fellow was working and was able to get our package.  Thank you, road angel.  When we told him what we were doing, he said, ""Where are your medals?""  Next in line for chores was to check on route information, traffic conditions (logging!) and the rest.  Like the post office, the highway patrol office was also closed.  We sat dejected for a few minutes until an officer pulled up in his patrol car.  He quickly fortified us with the advice and encouragement we needed.  Klamath River bound were we. Now we are ""camped"" in a Motel 6, a national chain that accepts dogs--no extra charge.  That's nice.  Django is out cold at the end of the bed.  I've just wedged my belly with pizza, salad, Sam Adams beer, and cherries for dessert--so much for the rough, tough life of cycle touring.  We didn't really want to motel-it again, but some towns don't present much else.  Besides, hot showers are never a bad thing.   "
226,"At a rough-looking bridge, we crossed the river, heading towards a campsite indicated on the map.  Today was to be a short one, afterall.         The dirt road that followed provided pretty easy riding, but the campground was on the OTHER side of the river.  ""The map is not the territory,"" as the linguist said.  Just as well.  The place was packed with noisy RV'ers.  We continued on, riding slowly due to the imperfections of the dirt surface.  We had the road to ourselves, so we didn't really mind.  The challenges, however, started to wear on us: up and down, sweating and grinding, losing traction now and then. At one point, we were worried about Django's paws and tried the booties for a while--useless.  They kept falling off and hurt the tops of his paws.    Continuing on the dirt seemed like a good idea at the time.  We stopped for lunch and thought we'd camp but rode on anyway.  Then the route really started to test us--and the trike.  At one point while crossing a muddy patch, the trike bottomed out, and we mangled one of the hydraulic brake lines.  In a near panic, I bent over to scrutinize the crunched line.  The grace of the road gods was with us yet again: no puncture of the line, just the casing was chewed up a little.  Duct tape soon had that covered, and I had many opportunities to brake good and hard on the remaining dirt sections to test the line--no problems.    Feeling a bit pumped and frazzled, we finally hit pavement again and rejoiced in smooth speed once more.  Ultimately, we pushed for a total of 45 miles and untold altitude gain, our toughest  day yet.  The last few miles were especially beautiful in the late afternoon light, the river rushing quietly beside us, racing us curve for curve to the campground just outside Hamburg.  We quickly unloaded, and I quickly zoomed off to the store (uphill, of course) for the essentials: beer and ice cream.  Ahhh.  Jodi and I staggered around a bit (not from the beer), setting up camp.  So much for our easy day. THE STOKER'S 2 CENTS:  By the time we reached the bridge at Walker, we'd been on the dirt for about 9 miles.  We were tired.  Once we were back on asphalt, I felt relief.  We also were no longer enclosed in trees; the views opened up and I felt expansive and happy.  Late afternoon light lengthened shadows and cloaked the landscape in gold.  Temperatures dropped to perfect.  However, still no guerrilla riverside bivies.  Long before we got near it, Scott and I both knew we'd end up at the campground at Hamburg, our next night's destination.  Oh well, we could do it.  But we both had to dig in, both physically and psychologically.  The dirt road had been draining, and I had worked extra hard because Scott's knees were hurting.   "
227,"THE STOKER'S 2 CENTS:  A rocky, tree-clad steepness of a few hundred feet lies opposite us, with an osprey nest on top of a snag, close to the top of the ridge.  Can see heads bobbing in the nest and mom and dad flying around, then alighting inside.  Blue herons occasionally glide downriver.  Dragonflies of many sizes and colors--shimmering teal, light blue, gold with dark bands--flit between willow branches and do their conjoined mating dance above the water.  Trout jump for bugs, which thankfully are not the human-torturing variety, for the most part.    Scott and I had a talk at the motel about the bad traffic.  I expressed my anger and then had to accept some of the responsibility for our ignorance of conditions on Hwy. 89.  Venting the anger was all I really needed and I feel much better.  The traffic has abated.  The days are beautiful.  I'm happy.    Tonight's dinner:  curried split peas with rice, broccoli, cauliflower, carrot, onion."
228,"We rolled for a while at an easy pace to let Django work off some energy, something, we found later, we needn't have worried about.  Django was on task this morning and couldn't wait to burn up his pads on the road to Shangri La.  After two easy miles on Hwy 96, we turned south onto Scott River Rd., and what a fine river and road they are.  We hit a cyclotouring jackpot today and saw other cyclists out enjoying the route as well.  Lots of steep climbing, sometimes over 9%, and ever deepening views of rapids, forested mountains and even snow-capped peaks kept us focused.  Through it all, hardly a vehicle passed us. The road narrowed to one lane much of the time.  We passed rotting shacks and fabulous trophy homes, some high overlooking the canyon, others low, down by the river.  We gaped in awe though not too much envy.  Except for vacations, these places would be simply too remote for our tastes.  Mostly, however, we sweated and submitted to the routine of getting Django in and out of the trailer, the price for an undulating route--climb, climb, climb, drop, drop, climb, drop, climb, drop--ugh.  Still, we could not help but grin.  This quiet, these mountains, the river, the sheer wild madness of it all were just what we had come for. Now we sit in the cool shade of Indian Scotty campground.  The day got progressively hotter until we were just plain ready to stop.  Django was a monster, however, and appeared ready to keep going no matter what.  Now he's sacked out and sleeping hard in the pine needles next to Jodi.  The river rushes in the distance; tall pines block the sun.  We're resting in our own little church of trees, wind and light. THE STOKER'S 2 CENTS:  No haze or clouds today.  Sky is perfectly blue and the air is sharply clear.  Forest is luminous, shining from within.  I find myself day daydreaming about living in a well-built house on the riverfront with animals--dogs, cats, chickens, goats--and raising fruits and vegetables.  We passed a little farm fitting this description, and I yearned to be there, pulling weeds in the lettuces, milking the goats.  I love where we are right now.  Having a good time.  But I could be home, too, growing my garden, building things, studying.  I recognize my need for experiences that expand my world and stretch me physically and psychologically.  But there are also things I need that nurture me and feed other parts of my being--the part that never had a secure, grounded home.  I create that anew for myself every year, and each time I leave it to do something else, no matter how wonderful, is an upheaval.  I feel like I lose my lifeline, and I have a sense of myself frantically reaching for it, unable to grasp it.   Tonight's dinner:  pasta, salmon, asparagus, lemon, capers, olive oil, asiago.  Again.  Yum.     "
229,"     The town of Etna was set at the base of a tall, pyramidal mountain.  We found a wonderful little coffee house and sipped super java in the shade.  Just acorss the street, the library offered internet access.  Down the street was the local brew pub.  We weren't going to be riding much longer today, that was for sure.  We got on a computer and cleared junk mail, responded to a couple of messages, and sent out a general note on our whereabouts.  The grocery store was a bit frightening except for organic coffee (didn't need any), organic bananas (bought four) and some wonderful tapenade that Jodi found--yum. We were able to camp in the city park for free--restrooms, water.  This was okay if a bit noisy.  We pitched our tent under the threat of sprinklers that never came on.  All in all, we decided that one night was enough.  We were anxious for the road. THE STOKER'S 2 CENTS:  One of the blessings of trips like this, and something I tend to forget, is that they can be altered on a whim.  There are always options to consider based on other people's input, or solely on desire.  So today, sitting in the park looking at the map, it occurred to me that Hwy. 3 continued on south, beyond Weaverville, to a junction with Hwy. 36, which runs west to the coast, ending near Fortuna.  With the heat coming on the coast sounded inviting.  Scott thought so, too.  Plus, I've never been to that part of the coast--the Avenue of the Giants.  We put together a route that would give us a good sight-seeing tour and allow us to return to Carson City right before the 4th of July holiday.  That decided, and both of us feeling excited about it, we made lists and headed back to town for supplies and information, deciding not to have a layover day in Etna.  Just as well.  Night in the park was a small bit of hell.    We'd relocated the tent to just beside a parking area because we'd been told the sprinklers would come on in the middle of the night.  I started having waves of anxiety, fearing a car full of drunken teens, or something, would drive right into us.  I had no idea how powerful last year's camping experience with Linda had been, when a pick-up truck, with a drunk at the wheel, attempted to drive straight down a hillside and nearly drove into my tent.  At 3:00 AM.  So my sleep in Etna Park was short, punctuated with anxious moments awake.   "
230,"  Oy! A toughie.  Parked now in the shade at a camp beside the Trinity River, the edge has come off the experience--a little.  After a quick traverse of the southern end of Scott Valley (and our only recumbent sighting so far--a taciturn grey-beard type on a Gold Rush) we pulled into Callahan, a mostly defunct mining and logging town with a store/saloon open but also for sale.  We needed to make a call.  The night before, Jodi had an inspiration:  Why bother coming back up Hwy 3?  Why not keep going, hook up with Hwy 36 and follow that to the coast?  I suggested we hook up with the Avenue of the Giants in the coastal redwoods and finish our ride in Redway, just outside Garberville, where we could rent a UHual truck to take us home.  Deal.  We called the California Highway Patrol from Callahan, and an officer gave us the intel we needed: no weapons of mass destruction (heavy logging traffic) and clear sailing, ""very lightly traveled,"" as he put it. We talked to a nice woman who tended the store and bar, and she informed us that southern California was trying to take the local water.  Good grief.  It never ends.  From Eaton, Mulholland and that cabal in the early 1900's to the 21st century, the south has been taking water from the north.  May the Scott Valley and Shasta regions survive. We saddled up and hit the wall, the 6% solution, six miles of 6% grade with almost 2,400 feet of climbing.  Over two hours of grinding effort to crest Scott  Pass.  The wind was really light, usually at our backs, usually not helping to cool us.  The first half went smoothly enough and was punctuated by a soaking we indulged in at a creek crossing.  We plunged heads, arms, jerseys, hats into the crystal cool water--ah, a chill as we slipped on the soaked clothing.  The chill didn't last, of course.  The last half tested us.  Sweat poured off me, sometimes obscuring my vision.  The summit was a welcome sight indeed.  The opening views were fantastic, but flopping into the shade up top was the best.  Jodi was in high spirits; Django hiked the whole grade easily, somehow containing his disdain for our sluggish pace--the usual 3 to 5mph wonder.  I was feeling pretty ""knackered"" as the British rock climbers put it.  I'd taken to clipping the term:  ""knacked"" I was.  Rest, food, and the knowledge of a big descent were the proper treatment.   I would have been nervous had I known what we faced in the drop to come.        We rolled from the summit and off the edge of the world: steep, steeper, steepest, hairpin after hairpin, brakes whirring, squeeling, pads smoking on sections of 15 to 20% in steepness, Lombard and Hyde Streets of San Francisco packed into the mountains.  Concentrating hard, feathering the brakes, bearing down with gripped fists, I could only glance at the fantastic views of the rugged canyon we fell into, the craggy peaks beyond.  We slid to a stop at a pullout to let the brakes cool then careened into more hair-raising hairpins.  Thank God we weren't planning on coming back up!   We traced the course of the Trinity from its trickle to the wide shallows below.   Finally, we broke free from the crazed incline and smoothed along happily on the canyon floor.  From the cool temperatures on the summit, we found heat below.  Nicely baked and emotionally drained, we made it to the last camp on the river before the reservoir lower down.  Jump in the river, food, sleep, rest, good. THE STOKER'S 2 CENTS:  I lost interest in our descent as temperatures soared into the 80's and our speed slowed as the road leveled out.  Cool breezes were replaced with gusts of furnace heat and the sun beat down relentlessly.  Running out of water.  Where the heck's the campground?  My mood turning sour.  I'm just despising discomfort on this trip.  We did, however, come across a little creek where we were able to get wet and cool and pump some drinking water.  Finally found the campground and got a great spot right on the river.  I felt ill when we got here, maybe too much exertion in the heat.  Took me quite some time before I could even drag myself to the river.  However, once I did, I certainly felt refreshed and revived, happy to go on living and cycling.   Learning some things from this trip:  Get as much road info as possible, mostly from CHP; find out about camping in more detail; be sure to know where re-supply towns are; motels in towns generally are better than camping; I love being by water and away from crowds of people.  Food-wise, almonds and raisins are the snack food of choice, along with jerky.  Protein. Good bittersweet chocolate.  Fresh fruit.   "
231,"What can I say?  Rest days are restful: no packing up first thing, no hurry to get on the road, no hurry about anything--just lots of time to sit, stare, think, not think, listen to the birds and river, play with Django.  How did Abbey put it?  ""Sure I've been lucky, but somebody has to be.""  Today I feel like Hesse's Siddhartha living out his days beside the river, at one with the changes of life, the timeless flow of the water.  Too many people have too little time, take too little time  to just sit and be.  Rush, rush, rush.  It makes us crazy.  I could make more money at a high-pressure job, but why?  As the Bard says, ""I scorn to change my state with kings.""  Always, it seems, the gifts of nature come strongest, the treasures first revealed to me by my father.     For all the wild's heat, bugs, cold, the mountains and deserts keep me coming back. We have, as far as we know, two to three big climbs on the rest of our route.  Alpine triking--ouch.  Tomorrow will be pretty mild, and I suspect we'll motel-it in Weaverville as the next day means a big climb to Hayfork summit.  Perhaps  tomorrow will put us at the 500 mile mark, a new record.  Hooray!"
232,"But the high points: 1) cruising by a mid-19th century lodge with its green lawns, pond and exotic animals--emus, llamas, crying peacocks hidden in the forest; 2)  the long, final, final! downhill grade into Weaverville, just coasting gloriously right into town and straight up to a cafe where we drank iced beverages on the covered patio; 3)  the town of Weaverville itself: classic late 19th century logging/mining town with brick and Victorian buildings, boardwalks, cafes; 4)  the Red Hill Inn where we got a room, a motel and cabins right out of a classic 1940's movie: pine covered walls, a great shower, comfortable bed, quiet and the best rates of the trip--$36 +$5 for the dog.  We could walk from the inn to any place downtown. Pizza and a 1930's version of Tale of Two Cities finished us off: ""It is a far, far better thing I do....""  Damn straight.   "
233,"We are parked now with our books and journals under some pines and a truly magnificent madrone reaching five stories or more into the hot June sky.  The upper branches reveal the smooth skin so like that of the manzanita.  We move our seats to maximize shade.  The afternoon roast is on. Social commentary:  In some of the towns we've visited, I've been noticing a number of ""free spririt"" types who walk around barefoot, so free and easy.  Frankly, I just don't get it.  They cross parking lots, gas stations, all sorts of nasty surfaces with oil, grease, dirt rocks, glass, hot black top.  What's the appeal?  Gross. THE STOKER'S 2 CENTS:  We decided we were too tired--and Weaverville too cute--to leave town at 5:30 the next morning.  Decided to linger, have breakfast, get cash, go shopping in the AM, and go down the road only 7 miles to a BLM campground.  Should have gotten that cash on Friday, when the banks were open.  ATM's don't dispense cash from credit cards without a pin # (which we didn't have), and you can't get a PIN # by telephone unless you're calling from your home phone.  Huh?  All the banks were closed today.  I devised a scheme whereby Roz (housesitter) would pose as me and call MBNA to obtain a number.  After several false starts due to needing more information, she got us our number and off we went to get our cash.  (So much for MBNA's tight security).  It worked.  So we shopped, bought too many heavy groceries and rode the seven miles to this campground.
"
234,"Jodi's idea was simply fantastic.  The evening shadows were cool, the climbing a pleasure.  We chugged up the mountain in high spirits, aided and abetted by an occasional cooling breeze.  By 9 pm the darkness was getting serious, so we pulled into a deeply cut pullout that sloped away from the road.  Almost no mosquitoes.  Traffic, already very light, trickled to almost nothing.  We drifted off to sleep to the sound of the wind in the trees. Once or twice during the night, a car stopped at the edge of our pullout.  When we crawled out of our tent this morning, we found that one of those cars had dropped off the Sunday paper.  Now that's service.  We debated leaving it behind--it was a heavy paper--but I didn't want to litter, and it would be fun to read later.  We packed it and hauled it to the summit. The pump to the top of the pass was a solid hour of effort.  The grade, however, was generally not too steep.  On the way we had grand views to the south, ranks of deeply forested ridges that fell into dark canyons, the clean pyramid of Chanchelulla Peak, a patch of snow still lingering on its north face.      The ride down from the summit was chilly, one of our coldest of the tour.  The Hayfork valley was a wonderful expanse of grassy fields and large oaks.  We brewed up some coffee in front of the local elementary school (Go Rams!) and found from the paper that a cooling trend was on the way.  Works for us. We knew we had some climbing between Hayfork and Forest Glen, our goal for the day, but no one, nothing on the map indicated a pass HIGHER than Hayfork Summit.  We took a beating for sure.  My mood darkened as false summit after false summit taunted us.  Jodi remained upbeat, but I had to dig in and sort out some of my emotions.  The road was the road, the mountain itself.  My frustration wasn't going to change anything.  This grade didn't care what I thought.  What was it Pirsig wrote:  ""The only Zen you find on mountain tops is the Zen you bring there""?  Here was a fine moment for practice.  I'd had expectations, desires about where the climb SHOULD end.  I was living for the future, for some moment beyond the next curve.  I needed to submit, just be with the climb, the steady cadence, my breathing, the sweat streaming off my brow.  Dig in and feel the burn, baby.      Then like waking from a bad dream, like staggering from a hot desert up to a bowl of fresh ice cream, we crested the blessed summit and plunged into the next drainage, miles long, steeply at first then gently, long sweeping turns where I hardly touched the brakes.  Vast forested ridges stretched out around us.  Down, down, down...to be swallowed by a canyon,  all the while the knowledge of the next high pass beyond stewing in the back of my brain.  If all that goes up must  come down,  then, when cycling mountains, all that goes down must go back up.   No rest for the wicked.  Where was my Zen? At the  bottom of the nameless grade, we cut down to Rattlesnake Creek, Hell's Gate campground.  Payoff.  Huge trees, deep shade, even so my mood was not the best.      After lunch, we slouched hot and sticky down to the creek.  Here was my salvation: a  glorious swimming hole with a couple of beaches.  I  ripped off  my sandals and flung myself into the cool, clear water.  Sacred ablutions, my body thoroughly gunked with  sweat, road  grime,  sunscreen, I emerged reborn, a happy cyclist once more.  Django romped; we shouted with joy.  Huge trees and jagged rocks ringed the pools.   We sit and write now in the breezy shade of our camp.  We had to filter water from the creek as the campground supply is dead.  Mostly now, we relish the contrasts.  Living with the struggles of the road, the heat, the straining effort of the climbs, then finding relief here, these things keep us grateful, aware of the simplest pleasures.   Earlier, we met some local alcoholics from Hayfork, or ""Hayforkers"" as we came to call them.  Nice, friendly folks who were happy to share their beer.  The main woman we talked to was a classic: floppy hat, plaid shirt with the sleeves ripped off, she was making this campground her home for the summer.  She had a stock expression of ""right on!"" with a particular roll of  the head. A jug of Old Crow sat almost empty on the table, but her friends started showing up for a party, one stepping from his car, an open beer in hand.  Another couple showed up in a car that had obviously been rolled.  Yep, nice and friendly, but we were glad not to be on the road.  Right on. THE STOKER'S 2 CENTS:  What a great time we're having.  Even though it's warm, temperatures have dropped.  The running water may not be working, but many of the sites are very well-shaded by tall ponderosas, Douglas firs, oaks, and maples.  We've been talking again of resting, then eating and riding part of the next big grade, but that was before we walked down to the creek to swim.  The most picturesque and swimmer-friendly water we've visited.  Little sandy beaches and a beautiful small creek, dotted with maybe 3 foot deep pools, small riffles, some jutting rocks, and ferns at the banks.  So I don't know.  Maybe we'll stay tonight, swim and sun tomorrow, and leave tomorrow evening.  I'm torn because part of me wants to savor this place and this time; another part wants to be macho and do even more miles and elevation gain.  Which will it be?"
235,
236,"So we rode 47 miles yesterday.  It was our longest, toughest day.  Even hardened cyclists, I think, would find it challenging.  We started with a seven mile climb, usually 6%, with fantastic views through the redwoods into the growing void of the Rattlesnake Creek drainage.  This climb to the South Fork Summit was, at least, an honest one--no false summits, just a steady climb to the top with fantastic views.  The pass was one end of the longest continuous mountain ridge in the lower 48 states, over 40 miles of high ridge line.  What followed was one of the best descents of the tour, mile after mile of gentle turns, mountain, river, sky, sweep and lean, brake lightly, flying, mad for the Mad River below.      At the nadir of the descent, we stopped at the Burger Bar in ""Beautiful Downtown Mad River""--the lunch stand, post office, and  a closed general store--for sale.  We talked to a couple of road angels, Roy and Susan, who offered us a place to stay on their thirty acres.  Jodi suggested, because the day was so fine, that we push for the coastal redwoods.  A cooling breeze was already slipping over some ridge we could not see.  This promise of the coast gave us courage.  We cast off for mountains unknown. As we packed up to leave, we talked to a slim New Yorker who had ridden his gleaming red Ducati rocket across country.  I noticed, however, that he had NO gear, just his riding clothes and a tank bag.  This guy traveled light.  As he sucked on a cigarette, he explained his method:  He started with a week's worth of t-shirts.  At the end of each day, he would use the shirt to wipe down the bike.  Then he would toss the shirt and start with a new one for the next day.  He had shipped packages of new shirts ahead to pick up as he needed.  He stayed in motels and ate every meal out. The road out of Dinsmore (the next burg beyond Mad River) was a real thigh master: loads and loads of 6%, a few turns in the 10 to 13%, and one little headwall about 17%!  We threw ourselves at this in a groaning rage, a low gear burn, and put it behind.  We were headed for the coastal woods and could see, just peeking over a distant ridge, a lip of fog pouting in grey beauty.  With the fog came the ever-cooling breeze.  We passed through an area of open fields bounded by conifers that reminded us a lot of western Sonoma county.  We felt like we were coming home.      Then the coastal mountains were done.  We stood at the edge of fog and sky, an unknown drop to the west and hot, dry valleys and ranges to the east.  We stopped and stared at the warning sign, a road marking like Dante's ""Abandon all hope...."": ""9% Grade, Two Miles""  Gulp.  Chill clouds formed and broke along the crest.  We suited up for the drop, strapped Django in, pushed over the edge.  Our world fell away in green escarpments, a jutting moss-covered tower of grey stone overhanging the misty valley.  One brake burning ramp followed hard on the next.  Another sign appeared:  ""10% Grade, Three Miles""  What?!  I bore down hard on those Hope disc brakes, hoping, needing them to hang in there.  I wrestled an alligator, battled a dragon, over 400 lbs of tandem trike and two smoldering six-inch rotors careening through the hairpins.... Somehow, they held, and we rolled away from the final steep and out into the valley.  I allowed myself to breath and stretched out the twisted claws that my hands had become.  Too much, too steep, not much fun.  Thank God that was over.  Traffic increased beyond Bridgeville, and the road narrowed, no shoulders, tight turns, trucks again, but quickly enough we saw the sign for Grizzly Creek Redwoods State Park.  The last little bit was a wonderful run through deep, overhanging branches, a tunnel of living, cool green.  We laughed and cheered.  We had made it.  The coast was a short ride away. So now we are in a $2.00/night hiker/biker campsite.  We wear most of our clothing, including warm hats.  Our hands are chilly.  The day will not even warm to 60 degrees F.  My only worry,  however, is doing these last few miles of Hwy 36.  The truck traffic is back,  and the route ahead is narrow, tight, blind corners.  Once the next fifteen miles are over, we should be free and clear.  The big climbs are over, too.  Time for more coffee. THE STOKER'S 2 CENTS:  So now, at 5:30, began the ups and downs to Grizzly Creek Redwoods State Park.  Frustrating stretch since the uphills were long enough to let the dog walk, but we finally--after a few unloadings--decided to carry him because he was tired, the hills weren't steep, the road was dangerous.  No one warned us about this road.  No shoulder and almost nowhere to pull off.  Lots of truck traffic--and cars, too--who needed us to pull over in order to get around us.  Road too narrow and twisty for much passing.  Nice flowers along the way.  There's always lots to notice at our slow speeds, and this close to the ground.  But the last two miles were all downhill.  So here we are, encamped in the fog and the fairytale old growth redwood forest.  Feels medieval and mystical.  Campground is right off the road and logging truck traffic begins well before first light.  So much for quiet hours til 6:00 AM.     "
237,"We had one painful climb before Fortuna and then a long coast into town.  Shotz coffee called out to us (we brake for espresso), so we pulled into this delightful cafe and sipped hot drinks al fresco.  Jodi looked over the phone book for places to eat.  All the interesting places were in Eureka or Arcata.  So why stay in Fortuna?  The dubious character of our chosen motel pushed us over the edge.  Wedged between two gas stations and looking a little worn out, this ""Bate's Motel"" did not inspire us.  While we were looking for alternatives in a phone book, a  local cyclist came over and struck up a conversation.  She gave us pointers on the best route to Eureka and a restaurant recommendation: Jamaican, Ijal's, lots of veggies and free-range chicken.  She even gave us a map.  Road angels strike again. So Eureka (meaning ""I found it!"") it would be.  We pointed our five wheels north. We checked into a Motel 6.  Our experience with this chain in Yreka had been good.  Our experience in Eureka kind of reek-ahd.  Our first room was down near the ice and vending machines--huge mistake.  After making dinner, we realized that the noise of the machines and people talking, coming and going was just too much.  We were able to move--upstairs.  Over sixty pounds of twelve-foot long trike were a real challenge up the twisting stairs, but we made it work.   "
238,"Parts of town are downright gorgeous; others are composting, the classic homes molding, paint peeling.  It seems, at times, a town on the edge, like it could go either way, though we did see hopeful signs: homes being fixed up, businesses humming.  Locals we talked to said that the economy is definitely turning around--with the attendant increase in housing costs.  Get your fixer-upper Victorian while you can. Dinner at Ijal's was a little on the scorching side.  Hooo man.  We ordered some ""Jerk"" chicken and weren't prepared for the zing in the sauce.  The restaurant was a low key affair, some pine paneling, beaded curtains, cool reggae streaming low from a stereo.  Ijal, the proprietor, is classic Jamaican and very nice--smooth accent and dreds.  He let us park the trike behind the restaurant and cable Django to a tree.  The food was excellent and very reasonably priced.  I can still taste the sweet potato fries and fresh ginger beer. Two Eureka observations: 1) Our second recumbent siting--a guy in a trike/velo car 2) a camper with pink flamingoes glued to it with this painted on the back: ""Flashbacks are the only thing I have to look forward to!"" Right on?           "
239,"By a little after 8am we were on the road, Django in the trailer grooving on the ride, and flat, quick pavement ahead.  We had to ride a few miles on Hwy 101, but the shoulder was huge, so we weren't bothered much.  We quickly rolled by the College of the Redwoods and its beautiful campus (sigh) and climbed the grade to Loleta to zoom down a fast hill towards Ferndale,  ""The Victorian Village,"" which was indeed Victorian, perhaps the best concentration of this style we've seen.      We discovered that at a previous stop we'd left behind Django's leash--arrrgh, another thing lost.  We've been doing a good job of that on this trip: two pairs of sandals (Jodi left behind her cheap ones somewhere), a stove cleaning tool, and now the leash.  A good thing the tour is almost over.  What else might we lose? We ate lunch in a quiet park at the south end of town and hit the short climbs out of town on Grizzly Butte Rd.  Shortly we turned  from the trees and out to wide open dairy fields, a snappy tail wind helping us along.  Sailing at 15 to 16 mph was easy.  The life.  Of course this ended with some hard climbs, but at least these didn't last too long, though one managed to hang in there for several painful minutes at 10%.  These climbs took us back into the forests along the Eel River, our watery companion for the remainder of the tour.    After a couple of lumber towns off 101 and a brief stretch on this busy road, we slid off the main stream and into the perfect conclusion to our tour, the Avenue of the Giants, the highway gods' gift to the touring cyclist.  Immediately we were engulfed in the perfect shade of redwoods hundreds of feet high, magnificent vegetables, the road a quiet, lightly traveled aisle through a green, living cathedral.  The miles clicked by, and by about 5 pm we found the hiker/biker site in the Humbolt Redwoods State Park: deep in the woods, flat, needle-carpeted tent sites, no RV's, no cars, no motors, generators--just two quiet, tired cyclists happy to call it home for the night.        Now we have a couple of days before, we hope, our U Haul truck is ready.  Jodi made over half a dozen calls back in Eureka trying to secure a truck.  There was only one in the area, and it was supposed to be back after the weekend.  U Haul couldn't guarantee anything, however.  Jodi pleaded our case, or special circumstances, and the woman in Redway said she would hold the truck for us, no matter what. So the ride is almost over.  Just one more stage, a little over twenty miles, and we're done.  Wow.  Over 700 miles.  It feels great.  We're both ready for more.  I'm especially gratified.  We've ridden some of the toughest terrain in the state.  Sure, we sweated and groaned, but we handled whatever the road threw at us--and with Django the Wonder Dog, too.  After this test, we know we can tour whatever we want.  A TransAm?  Someday. THE STOKER'S 2 CENTS:  Hallelujah!  We are camped in a redwood cathedral, the nave enclosed by the treetops, letting in light in amounts reminiscent of stained glass.  God definitely exists.  So does Satan in the form of mosquitoes and poison oak.  For the former we've got poisons; for the latter we pray we can keep the dog out of the underbrush.  We've been avoiding poison oak for hundreds of miles, and so far, so good.  But here it's particularly awe-inspiring.  Vines climb 30 or 40 feet up into the trees.  It mingles so pervasively with the blackberries and thimble berries that it's easy to miss.  But it's there.  It's everywhere, except in the pullouts, exhibits, and campgrounds, where government has made efforts to make the world a safer place for the paying customers.   We've ridden 716 miles so far, with 21 or 22 to go into Redway.  Breaking the 700 mark has meant much more to me than the 500, which is the number that's excited Scott the most.  700's exciting.  It's a really big number to me.  We're both feeling strong, able to do anything, and it's extremely difficult to spend even one entire day sitting around.    Highlights of this trip for me have been all the quiet stretches of beautiful highway from Mt. Shasta to Yreka; along the Klamath, Scott and Trinity Rivers; and right on through, out to the coast.  Also, the towns of Mt. Shasta, Weaverville, and Eureka--towns we explored and enjoyed.  Bathing in the rivers--always a real delight, not only because it's cooling and cleansing, but also because I slow down even more and stare at water, trees, birds.  The big trees, entire dense forests of them throughout the journey.  And the hard work, the soul-cleansing and mind-clearing of intense physical effort (which also helps me enjoy my rest days more and allows me to eat a lot without guilt). Dinner last night:  quinoa with garlic, potato, garbanzos, kale and feta.  Really good.
"
240,
241,"   The highlight of the day was meeting a local ""herb"" grower.  He lives a low-key, low-overhead lifestyle, and rides a bike everywhere.  We had a wonderful discussion ranging from cycling, dogs, and philosophy to politics and art.  He wanted to offer us some smoke but the plants weren't ripe yet. He said this was Humboldt County, and tradition was important.  We don't partake of the green matter, but the sentiment was appreciated. As we were talking, an older cyclist rolled in and started ranting almost immediately about the gross weight of his battery powered motor--30 lbs.  ""It looked good on paper!"" he proclaimed.  Huh?  A battery that runs the motor for only thirty minutes and then becomes dead weight?  On a thousand+ mile tour?  We wondered if he'd been taking some ""herbal"" supplements when putting his plans on paper.  Then battery man switched to a rant about some roads we had never heard of, going on and on about grades and all--this inserted into the midst of a conversation in which the rest of us had been deeply engaged.  Finally, he wondered off to set up camp.  What a character. Other people came and went during our stay in the hiker/biker site: a trio of young people headed to Alaska then Asia and beyond next year; the retired career military fellow, smitten by the touring bug and riding north then back across the country to his home in Virginia; a young couple from Davis, CA., both scientists on a break from their studies and research.  It was quite touching to see how the woman responded to Django and how he responded in turn.  She had lost her own dog just a year before and really took to Django, who played with her as with an immediate family member. Soon enough, darkness settled over our cluster of cycling adventurers, and we retired to our respective tents, the high branches swaying gently above.  Django flopped down at our feet.  I started an Elmore Leonard thriller but found the pull of sleep more thrilling.  We soon all three drifted off on this our last night of the tour.
"
242,"A final uphill grind led us to a crest above Redway and then smoothly down into town.  Ah, coasting to a finish...no.  Where's the UHaul?  A local said out of town, down the road then up a super steep grade.  Ah, he must be joking, pulling our chains as it were.  But he wasn't joking, not in the least.  A little over a mile out of town, we found our street and made the turn into an unbelievable headwall.  What the hell was this?  The last time we'd rented a truck at the end of a tour, the UHaul place was also outside of town, up a big hill, in the sun.  This was deja vu all over again--only this grade broke 15% at one point.  I growled, cursed, attacked the grade in a fury, sweat pouring into my eyes once more.  I heard Jodi grunting hard behind me.  Django trotted in boredom alongside.  What was this, some cosmic rule/joke?  All UHauls must be up a steep hill outside of town?  Our last pedal strokes must be in pain, heat, sweat?  Quadriceps throbbing mightily, we at long, bloody last pulled to a stop in front of the rental agency.  The cycling was over.   "
243,"But we're back now, the big climbs over.  We're scrubbed, shaved and fed, and the tour is slipping away, becoming history.  It happened.  We did it. It's over.  We're happy and let down, a little stunned.  Over?  Back?  Jodi reads a magazine; Django stretches contentedly on the carpet; my mom watches TV in the next room.  Outside, thunderstorm-driven winds whip the sage.  Memories, impressions linger: the sweat pouring into my eyes, the rattle of jake brakes on big rigs, the topping of passes and gazing out into vast canyons, mountains, clear rivers.  The Pacific fog and its blessed cooling fingers.  Hot coffee in the mornings.  And the people, the warm, friendly people who helped, encouraged, gave us a place to stay or just smiled and waved.  These are all part of our history now, and we'll treasure them.  From the desert dust to the ocean mist, it was a wonderful journey.  So, Jodi, where to next?"
244,"'On my own' may not seem entirely accurate. This year I was joined by 450 of my 'closest friends'. To those of you who travel self-supported this journal will seem quite tame, but for the uninitiated, I think a supported tour is a great way to start. My 2004 adventure was my fourth supported tour, and the very best yet.                 I chose the Shoreline West Tour, sponsored by the League of Michigan Bicyclists. The trip travels Michigan's western coast along Lake Michigan from Spring Lake to Mackinaw City. I was looking for a full week tour that was within a day's drive of Marquette, and had heard great stories of the beautiful route, especially from Pat, a dear friend I met on last year's Summertour. She was delighted to join me on my travels. (So there really was one close friend out of that 450!)                 Despite the cold, wet, windy spring, I managed to sneak in as much training as possible. Most weeks I would ride 4-5 days a week, usually 10-20 miles per day, with one long day of 35-45 miles whenever possible. I tried to throw in as many hills as I could, including the road that climbs by the local ski hill. My longest training day was a 72 miler; the route was the perfectly flat 400 and Omaha Trails in Wisconsin. But given it was high 90's, very humid, and I was riding my mountain bike, I told myself I was prepared to tackle the shoreline route. Please leave a message in my guestbook to let me know if you enjoyed my account. That way, I'll know whether I should write up another one next year!
"
245,
246,"I had really dreaded riding through both Grand Haven and Muskegon (I'm used to U.P. traffic), but whether it was the great route planning or the early morning hour, neither city presented any challenges. We passed many beautiful homes along Lake Michigan, and there were numerous opportunities for swimming, including Muskegon State Park and Hoffmaster State Park, both of which we rode through. Oh, and we passed lots of potential ice cream stops, also! In White Lake, Missy's Café had obviously been forewarned of our arrival and placed a 25% off for cyclists sign out front. We couldn't pass that up! Pat and I split a delicious chicken salad sandwich and a wonderful chocolate malt- YUM! Shortly after this, we picked up the 22 mile Hart-Montague Trail. It started off with a beautiful bridge, but quickly turned into relatively monotonous scenery. We did appreciate the traffic-free route. The fields of asparagus were interesting (I was told Oceana County is the Asparagus Capital).  As we were feeling the heat and miles, Pat and I decided to forgo the optional side trip to Silver Lake, including the cherry turnovers at the Cherry Point Market. Talking with those who made the side trip, they said the traffic and road conditions were horrendous, so we were glad we made that decision.  Once set up in Hart, there were shuttle buses available for those who wanted to go climb the dunes or ride the dune buggies at Silver Lake. I opted for a badly needed shower and an attempt at reorganizing my gear. After dinner, a shuttle took us over to the Hart Eagles Club for a Sunday night social with a DJ and cash bar. A cold beer hit the spot but I was soon back at the school and crawling into my tent for the night.     "
247,"From Ludington, we had a 30 mile stretch without another town, mostly hilly and unshaded. The tour organizers had persuaded the only store along the way, Betty's Deer Trail, to let them set up porta-johns, so we all purchased something to show our appreciation. Camping that evening was at Manistee Catholic Central High School- great turtle cheesecake for dessert! Then we walked into Manistee, explored the Riverwalk (think San Antonio on a small scale), and stopped at the House of Flavors for the day's ice cream. Once again, I was really ready for bed!         "
248,"In Onekama, a church group had a late breakfast fund-raiser with wonderful desserts. Pat and I picked up bread, muffins, cheese, and a bag of blueberries for lunch on the beach (after devouring the Boston cream pie and a raspberry bar). Fueled up for the hills, we were ready to go. The first hill was not particularly steep, but it did go on and on. I asked someone if this was the first hill and was told no. So when I hit the top of 'Killer Hill' (Hill # 2) and saw the watermelon waiting, I realized I had conquered two of the challenges already and I was ecstatic! The view was breathtaking (if you had any breath left after pedaling up the hill). It was steep enough that many people were walking. The third hill was unmemorable, except for the downhill that followed. I'm one of those strange people who doesn't appreciate speed on downhills, so I found it very frightening. In Elberta, we picked up the optional Betsie River Trail and rode the short two miles into Frankfort, another lovely Lake Michigan town. The wildflowers along the trail were so colorful.  Pat and I headed to the beach, where we watched the busy boat traffic, enjoyed our lunch, and waded to cool off. Naturally we had to finish the stop with ice cream. We had an interesting conversation with two men who had cruised over from Sturgeon Bay, WI, just to have lunch. Then it was back on the Betsie River Trail. This was an area where it was very nice not to have to contend with traffic and the scenery was very pretty. Once off the trail, we stopped in at Gwen Frostics Prints. She was an artist who created such simple portraits of nature. There were many reasonable gifts to choose from and it was really interesting to see the old Heidelberg Presses still cranking.       Two miles later, we had a very nasty crossing of US 31, followed by such a steep downhill that I nearly jumped off my bike and walked down. Both Pat and I swore we smelled rubber on that one. It was followed by that ubiquitous pre-school uphill that was also very steep. Traffic was heavy, there was little shoulder and I was spinning my way up, when another cyclist passed me, causing a passing motorist to offer a choice comment. I found that portion of the ride very unnerving. It was a relief to arrive at Benzonia Central. Dinner was pretty good, especially the strawberry shortcake (real shortcake!). That evening, our entertainment was provided by folk singer Dean Rutledge. He was a lot of fun, and had the whole crowd joining in. Shuttle buses were available to either Benzonia or Beulah, but I was tired enough to be happy to stay put.             "
249,"From here the scenery began to improve. We rode along Long Lake, a childhood haunt of mine, where we spent many summer days swimming and reading dust-covered comic books at Uncle Alec and Aunt Evelyn's modest cottage. Oh, how it has changed! It has now become choice lakefront living for the affluent  Traverse City area. Hills, headwinds, and traffic were also making an appearance. I was very relieved to arrive at St. Francis School and park my bike for the day. Conditions were crowded for camping, so Pat and I snagged spots along the sand of the playground. Pat asked me to join her on a visit to a friend's house on Lake Ann, but I declined. I sauntered through the Old Town District of Traverse City, barely recognizing once familiar landmarks like Dills Restaurant. Down on Front Street, the only business I remembered from the good old days (60's and 70's) was Votruba's Leather Goods. The town was swarming with tourists and I was happy to sneak into Ciao Bella for a delicious house salad (I was pretty tired of iceberg lettuce by now). I walked back to the school and managed to be one of the first ones to sign up with Ruth (our wonderful masseuse who accompanied the tour). Half an hour later, I was feeling no pain, laid down in my tent and fell asleep for a quick nap. I felt immensely better when I awoke. I met the people camping next to me. Valerie was from New Jersey, Skip was from Colorado. They had been corresponding by e-mail for 7 months and this was the first time they had met. I really enjoyed their company and we shared some great conversations, meals, and a beer or two before the week was over. Pat returned at dinnertime, and after a phone call to her husband, decided she needed to return home the next day. We finished off the evening with a round of cribbage by headlamp, and called it a night.   "
250,"We started off riding the TART Trail through Traverse City, a nice way to avoid the heavily tourist-trafficked roads. For part of it, we had a view of the bay. They had also laid out the solar system along the route, so that as you rode along you would pass an informational sign on each planet, and then, voila, there was Neptune hanging from a lamppost. Once off the trail, the rolling country roads were very lovely. And then, once again, we came to a nasty hill. When the hill is named, you know it's time to be prepared. Brackett Hill, while not particularly long, was easily the steepest hill I had ever tackled successfully. Although estimates from the folks at the top ranged from 10-20%, I later heard an official grade of 14%. There was even a fellow cyclist from Florida at the top video taping me struggling up the hill, just to prove to his fellow club members how fortunate they are that they live in flat Florida! I had to take a few moments to recover from that one. Within a mile, it was so worthwhile to be on that route, for as we rounded a corner, I thought we had stepped into the French countryside. Stretching before was a sea of smiling sunflower faces, as far as I could see. It was so enchanting that I couldn't stop myself from stepping in and becoming a part of it!  Reluctantly leaving this lovely spot, we continued to pass numerous apple and cherry orchard as we approached Elk Rapids, yet another spectacular town on Grand Traverse Bay/Lake Michigan.     Pat's husband arrived at the school just shortly after we did, and they were quickly on their way home. I wandered the half hour back into the downtown area by way of a lovely boardwalk along the Elk River, and hit the local pub for lunch. Here, I enjoyed a long conversation with a fellow cyclist from Iowa. I explored the town a little more, including the beach, the Island House Library, and the bakery! After the group dinner, I took the shuttle back into town (J.O. the bus driver was having a blast carting us all to the festivities of Harbor Days - complete with carnival). I finished the evening with a group of new friends at the pub, laughing heartily as we shared drivers license photos, which we all agreed were very poor representations of our current appearances. Once again I was comfortably in my sleeping bag by 10 p.m., ready to tackle the next day.             "
251,"Charlevoix was very busy but as spectacular as ever. Then we picked up the Grand Traverse Wheelway all the way to Petoskey, again thankfully, because the tourist traffic in this area would have been enough to run me off the road. The bike path follows the shoreline almost the entire way and is just breathtaking. I had many enjoyable conversations with new group acquaintances along this 12 mile stretch. As I pedaled along this spectacular path, it hit me that I was grinning like a Cheshire cat. The entire week had been so incredible, spending all my days and nights outdoors, in beautiful surroundings with wonderful people, riding my bike every day as long as I pleased: contentment!  About his time I also realized that I had reached two milestones: 1500 miles for 2004, and 2000 miles on my Terry Classic, new to me just last year. Yahoo!      When we did pull off the bike path, we had to ride along U.S. 31 facing traffic (on the advice of the Sheriff), but it was coned off, and only a mile, so short and not bad. The shoulder on that side appeared better than the other, so I think it was a good idea that they routed us as they did. Petoskey, which is a very wealthy and upscale community community does not allow road markings, so signs had been placed along the way to guide us. However, despite advance notice that 450 cyclists would be rolling through on Friday, the city decided they needed to repave a small section of the bike path that day, so we had to detour. But with the usual organization, there was a SAG at every turn and we were soon back on the bike route and pedaling our way to Harbor Springs. Coming into Harbor Springs along the beach and the 1890's homes was incredibly beautiful. And then, just as we neared the final mile came the requisite hill up to the school.  Just when I thought I was at the top, it switched back and kept right on going. Anyway, I made it!      In the evening, one of the participants put on a great slideshow, focusing on many of the highlights of the trip. We commended all of the staff for their hard work! As an example of what a cohesive group we were, we also presented the trip's mechanics with $1000 that had been donated by the partiticpants to help them fix the broken axle on their aging motorhome. Then, a friend and I walked down to get a (world famous!) Tom's Mom's Cookie and a quick beer. Returning, we walked up the steps and were rewarded with yet another breathtaking view looking at all the lights of Petoskey and Harbor Springs. I was really tired but very pleased to have managed the 70 mile day as easily as I did!         "
252,        
253,"This trip was so full of fun people and experiences. I hope you have enjoyed reading about my week. I want to thank Pat for being such a good friend and traveling companion. She is a great sherpa; her pannier and handelbar bag are always ready to accommodate that extra bag of cashews or blueberries that I can't quite squeeze into my rack pack.      If you haven't guessed from my description, I feel this was a first rate tour. Jamie, the Tour Director, deserves the highest kudos for a well-run show. Finally, thank you, Neil, for creating this fantastic and easy-to-use site!"
254,"        Another cause for celebration - Ron Keall, who has mentored everyone on this tour in the craft of bicycle touring is retiring from teaching.  He's bought brand new red Arkel panniers!         I hope that several participants will add to this journal, to record the challenges and fun of being alive riding a bicycle on tour with friends.   "

258," 
         The forecast was 30% chance of rain.  About 8 km out of town, black clouds in the west reached down to the horizon.  It was raining 'over there'.  Soon it was pouring on us.  There would be driving wind and rain for about 15 minutes, then as though we had crossed a line, there was dry pavement until the second and third downpours.
         We stopped for lunch at a weathered two-story farmhouse.  It was no longer inhabited, but the owners were there checking for vandalism. When we asked if we could lean our bikes against the house while we ate lunch, they peered at us through their cigarette smoke as though we were aliens.  The ice was broken when Ron pulled out his GPS to check our location, but obvious bewilderment as to our motives (sanity?) remained.
         We're flatlanders.  Regina sits in the centre of the Canadian Prairies. We have to ride at least 20 km to find a hill; however, there's almost always wind.  Prairie riders have to develop a mindset for riding in the wind.  Nevertheless, I was disappointed that the headwinds slowed the speed of our descent to the Qu'Appelle River to 45 kph.  
We were compensated by being able to enjoy our surroundings.  As we crossed the bridge, a pelican rose and soared above us.  Red-winged blackbirds sang in the marsh. The scent of wolf-willow in bloom surrounded us.
         We turned off the highway and began a steep climb out of the valley back to the plain.  After 5 km of gravel (The rain hadn't reached this side of the valley, thank goodness.) we arrived at the party site.
         The pig was in the roaster; the party tent was set up.  We pitched our tents on the lawn and began to mellow out.  Inspired by our ride, three other skiers had decided to ride their bikes to the party.  Having no load, they expected to catch up to us, but they hadn't counted on the delay caused by a flat tire and no pump. Eventually they and about 50 more ski club members arrived.  We feasted on roast pork, a 'garbage bag' salad (It's like stone soup.  Everyone contributes, and the result is amazing.).  I was surprised with a birthday cake decorated with red and purple flowers.  Thanks friends.  
        Sunday morning, Velda appeared outside my tent dressed in purple tights and a red jacket. A birthday salute!  Thanks Vee.   Sunday's return ride included a fast downhill to the river, a long 13 km gradual climb out of the valley and tailwinds!  Yippee!
         The three riders on this shakedown have a lot of experience, but there are small refinements to be made.  I have to do something about the soggy mess and the pool of water that collects in my handlebar bag in a heavy rain.  Ron's going to organize his rear panniers with mesh bags to prevent fallout when he unzips them on the road.  We're ready!  
         Except for Steve who is planning to ride his re-assembled bike 50 km towing 50lbs of water softener salt in his BOB, the rest of the 'purple and red' group will be 'shaking down' on tour.  Only 6 days to the start!






"
259,"It's Marion's birthday on July 5th.  It's an important birthday and one which deserves a celebration.  Candles, songs, wine, presents, a cake.  Yes, a cake.  A cake which should, by token of our self-contained status, be prepared in camp.  Not a tasteless, store-bought cake with little character but one lovingly prepared over a camp stove, requiring skill and attention and planning.  A cake whose labourious preparation would show how much the baker of said cake values Marion's friendship and support. 	 Marion is not receiving such a cake.  No, she will have to settle for the best commercially prepared cake that Sundrie (our destination for July 5th) has to offer.  I have searched the Web for a bake shop in Sundrie but with no results.  I wonder if she'd settle for a selection of Twinkies?  Hmmm ..... better not! 	 I really did try to come up with a plan for baking a special birthday surprise.  Really I did! Special mixes were purchased.  An 'Outback Oven' was obtained.  Many test runs were made.  Smoke filled my kitchen on many occasions as the oven's 'fireproof' cover smouldered in revolt.  Mysterious round burned patches appeared on the wooden cutting board. Raw and/or burnt cake dough filled the composting bin.  Various pans and pots were scorched and tortured.  Red-hot deflector plates glowed bright with promise.  But all attempts failed.  It appears that the illusive perfect camp cake will have to be left to other members of our group.  Tamela and Karen will no doubt rise to the challenge!   You see, the problem is that all of my camp stoves (I admit here to a certain fascination - some would say obsession - with camp stoves and gear.  I now own 8) have a fuel source which is directly connected to the actual burner of the stove.  It is nearly impossible to control the baking heat in such an arrangement.  The only type of stove which would work properly would be one with a tube connecting a separate fuel bottle to the burner.  The final straw in my trials was when the little burner in the Trangia overheated to the point of causing the alcohol to begin boiling.  Bubbling methyl hydrate and the safety of house and self made me finally realize that I had been beaten! I hope you enjoy the Twinkies Marion!
"
260,"In my time zone, it's 11:30 p.m.- 30 minutes to ""1 day to start"", but tomorrow is really our departure day.  It's about a 9 hour car trip to Cochrane from Regina, so most of us are planning to drive to Medicine Hat or thereabouts, and then continue to Cochrane on Sunday.  This makes for an easier drive and allows time on Sunday for our annual buying trip to M.E.C. in Calgary before going to the campground at Cochrane which is practically a suburb of Calgary these days.  I've packed my rear panniers and they seem to be bulging more than usual. I always confine food, cooking gear and any other smelly stuff to the front panniers. These will be hung or put in bear lockers when necessary. The mess kit, stove, and toilettries are in the front already  Food will be stuffed in tomorrow. I confess, I got carried away making jerky and dehydrating salads, and fruit - the morning will tell how much of it will fit.  I'd like to take a paperback with me, but right now, I'm not sure it will fit. Next time you hear from us we'll be on the road.
"
261,"For those of us living in communities too small for a Mountain Equipment Co-op Store (MEC), an annual pilgrimage is a must.  It was no surprise then, to meet Alison, Steve, Gord and Brenda in the Calgary store.    At the end of the afternoon: Gord and Brenda had new cycling booties - no more  Safeway bags for riding in the rain; Ron who collects flashlights as well as camp stoves bought a TIKKA Plus head lamp bringing his collection to a total of 13; Marion has new gortex pants, Alison, a new gortex jacket, and Steve, a new sleeping bag. While we were at River's Edge campsite at Cochrane we were surprised by a visit from former Freewheeler, Geoff Shaeffer, who now works in Calgary at CyclePath.  Sunday evening, however, he was riding a sleek silver Yamaha.   "
262,"It was foggy and cold in the morning. You couldn't see the bridge on the river next to the campsite.  Everyone scrambled to organize their gear and load the bikes.     
One person from each car took the the vehicle to Bow Valley Storage for the duration of the trip.  We were pleased to find the total for storing 3 cars for 2 weeks was $20 not $20 per vehicle.      After 2 km, we arrived at the hill out of Cochrane on Highway 22. The climb was not as fierce as anticipated; however, the shoulder was only about 2 feet ride, and the traffic was busy.  As I was grinding up the hill a car slowed beside me, and someone spoke to me from the window.  Startled, I moved over to the gravel.  The car stopped.  It was a rental driven by Japanese tourists. ""Is this the way to Banff?""   After the top of the hill, the 2 foot shoulder and traffic continued.  A beer can bounced behind me, tossed from a car.  Then I had 2 flats - hey this is my birthday.  What else will happen? The first flat was wire, and Brenda was close by in the truck.  She offered assistance and got the floor pump from the truck - ah, the pump angel.   Very soon after the first flat was fixed, it flatted again.  Ron was close behind and since he can change a flat in 10 minutes to my 30, he took over.  Looking for the cause, he found the spring from the skewer/quick release.  It had dropped in during the last change.  I'm sure I couldn't repeat that trick, if I tried. After Cremona, the shoulder widened and the riding became enjoyable.   At Sundre, I was feted by my friends dressed in red and purple.  Brenda's tarp was festoned with red and purple streamers, there were flowers and a centre-piece, bubbles to blow, sunglasses, cake (not home-made, but delicious), candles, wine and fun.           
Thanks everyone.  My 60th was fun and memorable - a celebration of friendship and being alive.
"
263,"This morning was ideal cycling- sunny with moderate temps, a slight tailwind, wide shoulder an little traffic. The country side rolls up and down and consists of pasture, hay fields, and trees, mostly aspen and spruce.  At times we could see the Rockies to our left as we were travelling north on Hiway 22.    Our lunch stop was in Caroline, AB., sitting on a bench in front of the municipal office.  As we ate, the skies darkened.  About 10 km out, I had another flat.  As I was wrestling with the tire to remove it, a light rain began.  I put on my light jacket.  As I was searching for debris in the tire, it started to pour.  I put on the gortex.  Now I have top-loading panniers, and the rain gear is always on the top, but with the bike upside down, opening a pannier starts an avalanche - oh well.  Today my tire angel was Karen who arrived with Tamela as I was pumping up the tire and helped finish the job. Lightening flashed and thunder rolled. The 3 of us sought shelter under the eaves of a garage in a farm yard and waited it out.   In Rocky Mountain House, I asked at the grocery store for directions to the bike shop.  After going to the stop light, turning right past the post office I arrived at the bike shop - too bad it was the Yamaha, Honda dealer.  They don't carry tubes with presta values.  I carried on asking directions, whenever,I saw a likely person.  I have discovered wearing red and purple flowers on your helmet makes people smile and more inclined to speak to you.  I did manage to find what were the last 2 tubes in the sports shop. We camped five km west of Rocky Mountain House on Highway 11 (The David Thompson Highway) at River View Campground.      Campground Wildlife by Tamela Friesen I'll tell you the moral of the story straight off: when you take double chocolate cookies for your Rocky Mountain bike tour, gorge yourself early - don't pace. We set up camp at Rocky Mountain House; ate a wonderful meal of re-hydrated alfredo primavera with a side of carot salad, and limited ourselves to 2 cookies each, out of our large zip loc full.  We set the panniers all neat and tidy in the vestibule and went for a walk. ""We chased a few aggressive squirrels away from your tent.  It's a put-your-bags-in-the-truck night!"" Brenda said. I picked up the first pannier.  There are dark brown cookie crumbs.  I inspect my brand new Arkels.  No holes, nothing.  I rather thoughtlessly brush off the crumbs and reach for the second bag.  There are scuff marks on the fabric. Apparently, the Arkel fabric was too much of a pain for the squirel to bother with.  It undid the zipper instead! Tore the cookie bag to shreds, thus ending our cookie run.  And, that's when our adventure begins. Sleeping like babes in a cradle, I am rudely awakened.  Scuff, scratch, huff.  There's a critter outside our tent. ""Shoo!"" I hiss with a cuff to the side of the tent. Scuff, scratch, huff. I look out the wind.  ""What the...?"" I grab my glasses and squint again.  It's large, but what? I fumble for the light, shine it in my eyes, wake my partner, and finally check the vestibule. My eyes widen.  ""It's a skunk!"" In sync, we repell onto our backs and scoot to the far side of the suddenly way-too-tiny tent, and stare at the ceiling. ""What do we do?"" I sneak a peak as the skunk fortunately exits our vestibule. We marvel at our luck - no burning the tent and still welcome to cycle with our friends.  We decide that perhaps double chocolate cookies are best enjoyed at home!
"
264,"The original objective for today was to cycle beyond Nordegg to Fish Lake Campground, a distance of 87 km.  We set out from River View Campground into a gusty headwind and drizzle.  Riding along Gord, Ron, and I find Tamela kneeling on the shoulder with a flat repaired and ready for air.  She needs a pump.  Karen carries it, and she has doubled back to find her glasses.  Maybe she dropped them when she helped Steve with his flat.  Assistance is offered and Tamela is ready for the road when Karen rides up with her glasses.      In good weather, the Rocky Mountains entice you as you ride west on Alberta's David Thompson Highway. Today they are not inviting as they occasionally loom coldly out of low cloud cover.    As we continue against the wind and drizzle, Brenda arrives in the truck with fresh cinnamon buns to revive us.  We decide she will drive ahead to find a closer campground.  We are all tired of riding into the cold wind and rain. Steve is having bottom bracket problems, and Tamela has brake issues. Good news! Jackfish Lake Campground is less than 20 km ahead.  It's a pretty site with a picnic shelter overlooking a lake.  There's no treated water, but there are three filters among the group.    Once the tents are set up, a temporary repair stand of rope is strung up in the picnic shelter.  Ron, the bike doc, works at Steve's bottom bracket and Tamela's brakes.    By 8:15 everyone is in their tent.  It was a tough day. At 5 a.m., I awake to a screaming wind. I am very apprehensive about the 94 km cycle to Davud Thomspon Resort.
"
265,"By 6 a.m. stirring could be heard from all the tents.  Everybody was preparing for a long, hard day. At breakfast there is mention that there may be need for shuttling today.  Brenda (aka B) will drive immediately to the Resort, set up camp, and empty the truck to make room for bikes and panniers if necessary. Shortly after 8, even those who like to linger over their morning coffee are on the road.  First, backtrack 2.5 km over gravel to the highway; then climb a 5 km hill into rain and wind.  Muscles protest, but gradually warm up. As the kilometres klick by, the rain gets worse, my wind/waterproof fronted tights begin to feel like a cross between a cold compress and a wet diaper.  I need the new gortex pants. Twenty-eight km down the road, there is another campground.  Tamela and Karen are there putting on more warm clothes in the shelter of the sign.  In the biffy, I change into my long johns and gortex pants. Now I am equipped: purple gortex hood from an old jacket over my helmet, yellow gortex cyling jacket, black gortex pants, gortex booties, and blue gortex lobster mitts over my cycling gloves.  Thank you Mr. Gore.    As Tamela and Karen leave, Ron rides up.  We set out and I get no more than 10 metres when I have that old familiar feeling - I'm riding on my rim.  Flat # 4.  Back to the shelter of the sign and the familiar routine.   Remove tent, thermarest, sleeping bag bundle from the rack; turn bike over; remove rear wheel; find tools; etc.  Ron takes over and finds a sharp stone embedded in the tire; uses vice grips to remove it, and puts a boot in the tire.    During the tire changing, Gord, then Alison and Steve arrive.  Alison is wet and cold, Gord is shivering. In addition to the misery of the cold and wet, Steve has serious bottom bracket trouble.    Hot drinks and warm dry clothes are called for, or we will be dealing with hypothermia.  I take the time to actually read the sign we've been sheltering under and find a map indicating there is a picnic shelter just behind the trees. Everyone heads to the shelter while I reload the bike. Hallelluia! Here's Angel B with the truck. When I arrive at the shelter, Alison is in the warm truck drinking hot coffee, and more is being brewed. Everyone is snacking and preparing for the next stage of the ride.  I make hot gatorade.  Ron eats the container of icing he packed for the planned homemade birthday cake I didn't get. Alison and Steve will shuttle to the Resort in the truck.  Gord, Ron and I set out.  Another 18 km and we are in Nordegg.  Brenda is just leaving in the truck and shouts ""Museum"" at us as she leaves to take Alison and Steve to camp.  She will return. We locate the Museum which has a coffee shop and find Tamela and Karen who recommend the pie and have cinnamon buns wrapped ready for the road.   Cline River (David Thompson Resort) is 48 km away.  ""It's downhill;"" the locals say.  There are indeed some very nice downhills.  I am cautious, braking on the downhills because I have a thump when I exceed 30 kph - the tire boot?   Not far from Nordegg, a Camry pulls over onto the shoulder in front of us and stops.  Out steps Brenda.  What's she doing in a car?  Where's the truck?  It's in Nordegg with the keys locked in.  She needs Gord's keys.  Guess where they are.  B has another set in her bag at the resort.  The Camry driver, Rose, who is a volunteer at the Nordegg Museum, offers to drive her to retrieve them.  Rose later refused offers of money or to fill her gas tank, suggesting B help someone out in the future.  Thank you, Rose, B will pay it forward. Gord and I catch up to Ron who tells us a bear has crossed the road in front of him.  At km 78 Brenda appears with the truck.  Gord and Ron put their panniers in the truck and are treated to a quick massage by B. before setting out.  I load my bike, and gear and finish the last 16 km in the truck.    Less than 10 km out, we stop for Tamela and Karen.  Tamela loads her gear into the truck before continuing.  Only Karen, our Wascana Lance, made it all 94 km carrying gear.
"
266,"This resort is the perfect spot for weary cyclists to rest.  Today we've enjoyed the cowboy breakfast bbq - 2 eggs, 2 pancakes, 3 bacon, a side of beans, coffee and juice.  I can't believe I ate it all! After a stop at the laundramat, it was off to the pool and hot tub for Tamela, Karen, Ron and I.     B. & G. are exploring the hiking trails around the resort.  Alison, our marathoner, goes running and Steve's taken his Trek back to Rocky Mountain House for repair.      Everyone spends time cleaning and lubing their bike. Steve returns with a new bottom bracket, headset, and tires on his bike and a new tire and tubes for me.  We hope our mechanical and tire problems are now solved.    Rest Day  by Tamela Friesen The clouds hang low, weaving about the mountain peaks.  I sit, alone, quiet, and watch and listen.  The Saskatchewan River Reservoir sprawls in front of me.  The water, laden with tell-tale green Rocky Mountain silt, laps against the boulder on which I sit.  The breeze is cool and light, refreshing my heart and mind. I scan 360 degrees along the horizon.  Jagged, barren rocks thrust 100s of feet up, tower all around, each peak, its own millions of years of history, with the odd patchy carpet of evergreens.  There are no boats, no cars, trains, no planes, no people.  A bird swoops down and lights on a decaying log, landing in a patch of delicate alpine flowers.  I lay back on my boulder.  I see, I hear, I rest.   "
267,"Today, the David Thompson Highway was the awe inspiring ride I had hoped for when planning this trip.  Early  morning, no traffic, the mountains shine in the sun, the air is chill and clear, beside me in the ditch a litany of wildflowers: mountain avens, asters, indian paintbrush, harebells, sweet clover, goat's beard, dandelion, yarrow, purple vetch, wild roses, cone flowers and more.      Too soon, we are at Saskatchewan Crossing located at the junction of the David Thompson Highway and the Icefields Parkway. Buses carrying tourists to the Columbia Icefields stop one after another. Tourists swarm the restrooms and the souvenir shop that has every tacky souvenir imaginable.  I manage my pit stop just ahead of a busload of Japanese tourists; check out the basic groceries available in the store, and have a picnic on the lawn.    The ride south out of the Crossing seems tough.  Ron checks his gps.  We've climbed 100 metres in 5 km.  As I stop to catch my breath at a lookout, a cyclist coming north stops and crosses over to talk with us.  Only when she reaches me do I recognize B taking advantage of the good weather to ride her new Giant.  She leads us to our camp for the night at Waterfowl Lake.

  I remember the first time I cycled the Icefields Parkway.  I was amazed at the wonderful little campgrounds (Mosquito Creek and Rampart Creek) that I had sped by in previous car trips.  Waterfowl Lake is another wonderful campground although it is not really small (116 sites), and is situated beside the Mistaya River where it enters Waterfowl Lake. A trail leads to Cirque and Chephren lakes for great hiking.    Our sites are opposite the picnic shelter and bear lockers.  To avoid food smells in the campsites, we all cook in the shelter.  It's a bit dark in the shelter, so our candle lanterns are hung from the rafters. We really don't need them otherwise, it's July, the sun doesn't go down until after 10 p.m.    For most of us, it's the usual fare: couscous, a pasta side dish, instant rice or potatoes with a protein; canned chicken or fish, and veggies - raw or stir fried carrots, onion and peppers are common. Tamela and Karen, however, are carrying all the meals required for 10 days, plus extras.  They have dehydrated ingredients for a turkey dinner, beef and chicken stir fries, salmon patties, almond smoothies and more.  They have dehydrated cole slaw, carrot pineapple salad, zuchinni apple salad, a mexi-bean salad and the ingredients for cake and cinnamon buns!

  Tonight, July 10, is our club president, Velda's birthday.  She's not on this trip because she's going cycling in Ireland in September. Last year on this date, we were all at Chute Lake on the Kettle Valley Railway.  Tamela and Karen made triple chocolate (pms) cake.  This year they are doing it again.  To check how much baking powder to add, Karen checks the elevation on her gps; Tamela listens to her small  digital voice recorder for her recording of the amount of baking powder required for different elevations.  Then the cake is in the pan over the scorch buster and soon a wonderful chocolate aroma fills the picnic shelter.  As our mouths water, Ron reminds us that you need a stove that does not have a burner that sits above its fuel source for back country baking.  Several near disasters (boiling fuel, melting parts) in his practice attempts to make me a birthday cake have taught him so. (Ron has described his cake making misadventures earlier in this journal.)    At last Karen divides the cake; Tamela records us all singing ""Happy Birthday, Velda, in absentia"" and we devour the chocolate wonder.  Happy Birthday, Velda.
"
268,"It poured last night. Rain hammered on the tent for hours.  This morning the bottom portion of the tent and fly is covered with dirt splashed up by raindrops. The tents are wet, but the rain has stopped; the weather is cloudy and cool.  The summit of Bow Pass is 17 km from Waterfowl Lake Campground.  Everyone is a bit apprehensive, but the traffic is light and the pass seems quite mellow to ride.  Only the last 5 or 6 km is a seriouis climb, the first part rolls.  The summit is actually off the Parkway above Peyto Lake, one of Banff Park's more beautiful sites.  Those who have not been there before make the climb.  Ron and I continue on to Num-Ti-Jah Lodge on Bow Lake for excellent mulligatawny soup and tea.

  There are a lot of cyclists from a CANUSA tour going the opposite direction. Most of them are underdressed for the weather, wearing only shorts and light jackets.  It rains for the 40 km from Num-Ti-Jah to Lake Louise.  I'm toasty warm in shorts, long johns, gortex, lobster mitts, etc., but I expect many of the riders on the opposite side of the road are cold inspite of the climb.     At Lake Louise we snack at the bakery and visit the shops before heading to the campground. In order to protect tenters from grizzly bears, the Lake Louise campground for tents is surrounded by a 7,000 volt electric fence and a texas cattle gate that also seems to be electrified.  I enter through the pedestrian gate as I do not want to ride over a wet cattle gate.    Half the group goes to town for supper.  Tamela gets out her voice recorder for the recipe for haystacks and she and Karen concoct another chocolate treat.  The entire group attends the presentation that evening on bears. Estimated number of black bears in Banff National Park 50 - 60, grizzly bears: 55-80.   "
269,"It's sunny for the 2nd time in the last 7 days and temperatures are moderate.  Eventually we all end up at the bakery in Lake Louise for our first or second breakfast and then head out on the Bow Valley Parkway (Highway 1A) to Banff.  Although there are no shoulders, this is one of the best rides in Canada.  The scenery is glorious; the speed limit is 60 km per hour, traffic is limited to folks interested in the scenery and chances are good for wildlife sightings. At the railway siding by Protection Mountain, a group of cars is stopped; people are out of their cars.  It's a bear jam.  A grizzly is feeding beside the railway tracks and many tourists with cameras are closer than the recommended 10 bus lengths.  At Morant's Curve I stop to admire the scenery before riding on.     As we near Castle Mountain we see tucked into the trees at the side of the road a monument to the Ukrainians, some of whom were Canadian citizens, who were interned at Castle Mountain during the first World War - a reminder of past injustice and how fragile our freedom can be.      The entire group assembles at Castle Mountain Lookout for lunch and to watch the train below.         The next stop is Johnson's Canyon where there are seven waterfalls.  Most opt to hike to either the lower or upper falls. Between Johnson's Canyon and Highway 1, there is a traffic jam.  There's a male elk with wonderful antlers right beside our lane.  Since traffic is stopped, we move to the opposing lane to pass.  A little farther on, an osprey feeds its young in a nest on top of a power pole.      Eventually The Bow Valley Parkway rejoins Highway 1.  it is getting hot and after the quiet and beauty we have just experienced, the traffic feels oppressive even though there is a good shoulder.  The final climb to Tunnel Mountain Campground 1 seems to be too much, although it is no worse than many I have already climbed.  I stop and walk.  Maybe I need to adjust to the heat.  At the campground we learn a bear has been seen that day, and we notice a bear trap in the powerline cut as we cycle to our site. There is a bus stop at the entrance to the campgrounds.  Most of us turn in early, but Tamela and Karen take advantage of the bus at 9:30 p.m. to go to the hot springs where they are serenaded by a group of chinese tourists singing the Halleluiah Chorus.
"
270,"Tunnel Mountain is one of the few campgrounds that you leave going downhill.  Today's ride continued downhill on the shoulder of the Trans Canada Highway for 25 km to Canmore where we stopped for lunch and shopping before taking the highway for another 35 km to highway 40 which leads into Kananaskis country.     The drivers on Highway 1 are dangerous. On the stretch between Canmore and Kananaskis a big rv towing a suv came over the white line onto the shoulder way too close to Ron, and then I couldn't believe it when two cars drove side by side trying to pass something from the passenger window of one car to the driver in the other car at 100 kph or more. The one on the right swerved toward the one on the left and then corrected.  Had he over-corrected or collided, it would have been bad news for any cyclist nearby.  We were all lucky today. Highway 40 eventually leads to Highwood Pass, the highest paved road in Canada.  Most of us cycled it a few years ago.  Today we climb steadily the 29 km to Mt. Kidd R.V. Resort.  I made an error on the ride sheets and the distance was given as 25 km less than it actually is  resulting in riders arriving later and more tired than they expected.  Sorry folks.     "
271,"What better way to begin a rest day than with a leisurely breakfast?  Tamela and Karen's bountiful panniers yield pancake mix and about 2 pounds of dried blueberries.  Soon the berries are rehydrated, some are added into the pancakes and the rest make a blueberry topping.  When the pancakes are cooked, a package of precooked bacon is re-heated.  At the next site shared by Steve & Alison and Brenda & Gord, apple pancakes and omelettes are being stirred up.  Let the feasting begin.      Everyone has different plans for the day. After breakfast Steve gets out the laptop and the cell phone so I can update this site.  It worked at home, but not today so I take advantage of the indoor hot tub that looks out on Mount Kidd; write in my journal, and eventually retire to the shade on my thermarest with a book. Finally it feels like summer.  It's hot; insects are buzzing; a yellow butterfly passes; squirrels chatter; ravens scold the other birds. Tamela and Karen hike to Wedge Pond where some brave souls are swimming.  On return they swing in their hammocks.    G & B, Steve and Alsion explore by bicycle taking the bike path that runs through Kananaskis to the golf course and Kananaskis Village.   Ron disappears into the air conditioned recreation room.  We will all meet for supper at the Boundary Ranch Steakhouse down the road 3 km. About 4:40 Steve rides into the campground on Alison's biking reminding me of a circus bear on a tiny bike.  He's had a flat and on this rest day did not have a tube or tools with him. Oops. Everyone makes it to the restaurant on time, and we enjoy really good steak with a stuffed grizzly looking on.  As people will likely take off as soon as they arrive back in Cochrane tomorrow, it's our last meal together.  Everyone agrees it's been a great experience if challenging at times.      On our return to the campground, we learn we have just missed Geoff.  We had forgotten he was coming and chose an early supper so those interested could go to the presentation on rodents.  Sorry, Geoff.
"
272,"Today a treat from Gord and Brenda.  They've offered to carry all the gear in the truck. As soon as the truck is packed so the load is balanced and Brenda can see out of the rear view mirror, we start out.  The 29 km to Highway # 1 is  down hill with one short steep climb. A short distance from the campground deer cross the road in front of me.    At # 1 we double back 3 km to pick up Highway 1X through Seebe to Highway 1A.  Aspens grow along the highway and the Bow River flows along side.  The mountains are behind us. Just past Seebe a trail ride from a guest ranch  crosses the road and I see more deer.  This section of the Bow Valley Parkway is rear view mirror cycling.  The road has no shoulders and the pavement is deteriorating near the edges.   Most of the area is part of the Stoney Indian Reserve.  We pass the rodeo school and Tamela and Karen stop at the Lodge for gatorade.  Past the reserve there is a roadside stone memorial to fliers who died in a training accident in the valley during WWII.  We arrive at the historic McDougall Church. Rev. George McDougall and his son John, pioneer Methodist missionaries to the Stoneys, built this first Protestant Church in southern Alberta in 1875. The site is open and becomes the lunch spot for most of the group. Near Ghost Lake good pavement and a shoulder begin and continue all the way to Cochrane.  Ghost Lake is a provincial recreation area and people are launching seadoos and coming and going from sail boats. A head wind begins and increases as we cycle the final 15 km to Cochrane. At Bow Valley Storage Brenda has all the gear out of the truck organized by vehicle.  We pack up, say our farewells and head our separate ways. Ron and I return to River's Edge Campground for the night.  About 6:30 a man comes to the campsite telling us to watch the skies, there is a tornado warning.  Half an hour later the sky to the west is black; the clouds are moving east.  The sky to the east is covered with big thunderheads moving west.  A picnic shelter is not a tornado shelter, but it's all we have. We  watch.  The clouds meet. The wind picks up and drives rain through the cracks between the boards and the floor of picnic shelter. Three inches of water cover the concrete floor. We sit on top of the tables, our feet on the benches.        When the storm is over there are lakes all over the campground.  A boy rides through one and the water covers the jockey pulley on his bike.  Our tents have withstood the wind, but Ron has not chosen the high ground.  His tent sits in water.  Fortunately only the corner of his sleeping bag is wet. I take it to the laundramat to dry.  He moves the tent; dries the floor and will have a comfortable night after all.   "
273,"It was interesting to read Ron's List, as published in the Journal of our Purple Tights trip.  My first bike tour with Ron was in 1997 when we did a loop through Waterton-Glacier.  Ron handed out a list that time too.  And that original list has served as ""The List"" on many subsequent trips.  The differences between that original list and this new one show a high degree of technological evolution.  There was no 'cell phone and 12v cable' on the old list, for example.  Neither did we see one 'solar charger' in that list of touring essentials.  The listed 'MP3' may not have been invented at the time the old list was compiled.  Some of the gear on the old list has an updated and very specific name now.  For example, in bygone days we were reminded to carry 'spokes and/or ""S"" spokes'.  Now it's 'a KEVLAR spoke'.  'Rain gear' has become the 'Bernoulli jacket and coated nylon waterproof pants.'  The old tarp is now referred to as the 'Integral Design Siltarp'.  And the camp stove is the 'small Trangia'.  That last item name reflects a personal trait of the list-maker, in that Ron could also have brought the 'large Trangia' or any one of a number of other stoves from his extensive collection.  Ditto flashlight-type items.  My favourite alteration to the list has to be the 'spare reading glasses'.  I have combed the original list and failed to find any mention of reading glasses, period.   Now we want not only our reading glasses, but also a spare pair!  Hmmm.  This Purple Tights Red Panniers trip, as you have read,  was a supported tour.  My new Giant touring bike was certainly along for the ride - and was twice ridden -  but most of the time I toured in the Chev S10.  This made a BIG difference between the items listed as essential for self-supported touring - on either list - and what was actually carried!     To begin with, we realized right away that certain camping amenities could now be accommodated - a cooler, an ax, a hammer, a bigger tool kit and a 12 x 14 tarp.  None of these was mentioned on any list!   The kitchen gear I would ordinarily have carried in two panniers expanded to fill two of those big plastic pop/diary cases. I also had a pillow, two SMALL fleece blankets,  and a hair drier.  And Steve's lap-top!  We wanted it so we could download pictures and maybe even put entries into this journal.  We carried his power bar and inverter too.  The first morning of this trip, in the Cochrane campground, we were shivering and damp.  The weather forecast was disheartening.  So.... into the back of the truck went a collection of heavy fleece jackets, a winter parka, lots of extra shoes and a bulging back-pack of extra clothes.  In the course of the next few days, these extra cozies put in several appearances.  Then there was the Birthday Box!  You can't have an Important Birthday without a party, and you can't have a party without Party Stuff.  For this party we needed Red and Purple Stuff, and it was in the box!  Back to Ron's Original  List ......  Under the heading ADDITIONAL, we discover listed, an anvil, bricks for ballast and lead weights.   Hahahaha!    I could have fit those in EASY!
"
274,"Ron has flown to New Brunswick.  Beginning about August 18th he will be riding the AC Northern Tier route from Maine west - his rite of passage into retirement. I'm off to Ontario and hope to bike on Manitoulin Island and work in some other day rides amid visiting family.   Tailwinds, everyone. Marion"
275,"         I have made flags for everyone to put on their flag holders stating ""Team B.L.A.S.T (cool font in black), Bag Ladies/Lads Are So Tough (in orange), a real picture of a Georgia Peach and 2004 TransAmerican Georgia Peaches (in orange).  This was done courtesy of my taking a Photoshop class through school and the fine work of Kinkos in printing and cutting.            Tomorrow we will get up early and take a spin on the Oregan bike trails and then go meet Steve, the 'Lad' on the journey, at the airport.  You know men get lost and don't ask directions so we have to escort him back to Barbara's parents' house.   Hum, will it rain tomorrow?"
276,"         On our route to Boring (yes, that is the name of the city - glad we didn't make it to there) we saw lambs grazing and I thought otters.  There were 4 babies and 3 adults.  Two babies came up the hill and got within 2 feet of us - at that point we started backing up cause it had a long hairless tail and we thought it was a hugh rat (which posed the question - did the adults get into radioactive material, cause they were huge)  Not to fear, we read the handy roadside sign and found out they were muskRATs (we were close in our guess).            The trip back was uneventful and we came home to a great lasagna dinner cooked by Barbara's mom.  Today we did laundry and are waiting for Jeff as we finish packing.  After yesterday's rain I have decided to search out a pair of better waterproof glove covers - the ski ones bombed, so off to home they will be sent.
"
277,"         I last left off at Barbara's house.  Jeff W. kindly rented a van and Barbara's dad and mom took us to Astoria to begin our journey.  On the way we stopped at the biggest Sitka spruce in the US.  Around it was a ramp and circular deck that Barbara's dad had helped build!  It was truly huge - all four of us could touch finger tip to finger tip and add 1-2 more people for the diameter.  The trees are incredible - firs and spruces as abundant as the pines in the south.  I have never seen so many abundant and such large ferns - everywhere.              On the first day out of Astoria and everyday after on the coast we had rain on and off and cool winds with temperatures starting at 55 - 60/64 degrees during the day.  I stayed in my gore-tex and booties to stay dry.  My  patagonia airus underneath the jacket kept me warm.            In Astoria we stayed at Fort Stevens SP - $4 per person.  At this site there was a bush that had orange berries on it - they were salmon berries and tasted like blackberries.  (food is a big thing with us) After setting up camp we said goodbye to Barbara's parents and went into Astoria to find food and the drop off for the van.  Not much luck on food.  Not a metropolitan city as Atlanta.  Finally at 9:00pm we went into a Mexican retaurant which had closed early due to cleaning up the kitchen (that is always nice).  It looked like the real thing and we were kinda stumbling around due to hunger and disappointed they were closed.  I said ""I bet the food would have been good.""  Well, they did have the somberos on the wall and the staff were Mexican, not gringos.  We settled on Chinese - they were Chinese as well and that food was plentious and good.  (I may make up a few words.)  It hit the spot and by 10:00 pm now wobbly on our feet from sleepiness and full stomachs we headed back to our site.             In the morning Jeff took the van in and came back in a taxi.  I had cereal that was high in fiber and hard as a rock.  After that bag is finished I got a gentler teeth cruncher and started adding bananas and nectars to it. (no milk and no extra fiber was needed).  We began our journey by riding to the beach, waving at it and turning to start on our way. It was drizzly most of the morning. Barbara's brakes and cassette were causing her problems and we stopped in Seaside for repairs and lunch.           Jeff was our navigator and he did a great job.  We followed all the side roads off 101 hwy to get closer to the coast and the view. The route is marked with ""Oregan Coastal Bike Route"" alongside the roads - so we knew we were on track.  Oregan is very bike friendly.  We went through a gated community - per a local who said we could get out on the other side.  The houses were typical of the New England coast and we saw the ocean through their yards.  A deer crossed our path in this neighborhood.   We ate at Normas in Seaside - known for its clam chowder.  They had fried salmon - delicious. For dinner we stopped at Safeway and the guys bought bread and sandwiches and the girls cooked.  Well, we have the stoves.  I bought couscous, mushrooms, garlic, scallion, red pepper, cheese and a tuna package.  This was divided to make two meals and was tasty and filling.  We stayed at the hiker biker that night at Nehalam State Park.  The shower was hot & clean. The parks here have lots of yurts - round tents that have electricity and heat.  They are cheaper to build than cabins - $8-10,000 and are always booked. A deer non-chalantly came into our site grazing.            Two women from Boise, ID were there as well with their dog - a 40 pounder. Well, I have been going up to every dog to pet them - I miss Chestnut.  We rode through one town and a white German shepherd was on the roof barking.  They were laughing that I couldn't pet that one.             We went to Cape Lookout on Day 2.  We had a snack at Downies in Bay City.  It turned out as luck would have it that this home town restaurant is known on the West Coast for its pancakes. Well, it was too soon - we weren't hungry enough to partake of it but Barbara and I got delish hot chocolote with cream on top and I bought a Marianberry pie that is like a blackberry - home made crust.  I bought a biscuit to go since the guys enjoyed theirs so much.  They wrapped up butter to go, something we won't buy to carry.           We then went into town and stopped at the Tillamook Cheese factory.  Got an Oregan pin there and some cheese for the second night of couscous.  Squeaky cheese is the curds before it becomes cheese.  It squeaks on your teeth as you eat it.  I watched the factory videos - it takes 5,500 quarts of milk to make 1 pound of cheese.  They have the ability to let 50 billion pounds of cheese age.  It was interesting watching the cheese come out, get cut, have random quality contol on the size, go around and get put into the plastic and then have the plastic sealed.  They also make ice cream, and, a land mark occasion -Barbara did NOT get any!             We went down the road to eat at the Fern - would not recommend it but it was better than crackers at a convenience store.  They said ""grilled tuna sandwich"" - this translated into tuna fish with tillamook cheese.  One trip for the salad bar was included so I got broccoli and onions for the couscous.  Debi joined us at Cape Lookout campground in a van. We were at the beach! It had been a tiring day - hilly, rainy but mostly gorgeous.  Instead of cooking the couscous I went with Jeff and Debi to a restaurant cause we had a van and they said seafood.  Well, folks - seafood on the west coast is oysters and fried halibut.  The fish was great and they had a secret sauce - we guessed some smokey ingredient with ketchup - making for a nice change.  I had my second pie of the day - chocolate cream pie. Now if you are wondering - do I have a sweet tooth - yes, and I am actually eating well - but two homemade pies in a day - well, I am almost as bad about them as Barbara is about ice cream.            The owner talked to us a long time after the meal about her jobs, her help, her life here.  Then she told us about the hill - 800 feet.  Well, it was not 800 feet - it was a 10% grade to heaven - thank god for my new 20 chainring!  It was 1000 feet, at least my knees said so. Got the stiff legs warmed up right away and some great pictures from the top.  That was the beginning of the hills, the rest about 5%.  I will thank my sister, hope she reads this, for giving me the altimeter (the bubble leveler type) for Christmas.  Now I know how much I can brag or complain - whatever I choose for that day.  I was whooped.            Steve rode this day minus his BOB, Debi had it in the van, to help him rest.  He had low iron several months prior to the trip and had not been able to train as much as he would have liked.  We stayed at Beverly Beach SP. It was beautiful - large spruce, skunk cabbage, looked like a garden.  Debi greeted us with chocolate!  Did I mention eating was one priority? I did cook the rest of the couscous - did not want to carry anymore than I needed after that day.  Had another great shower but prior to bed a group of surfers came by.  There were more that 8.  They partied - talked and drank all night.  At 1:36 am I got up and knocked on the hosts door for 15 minutes - no answer.  At 5:00 am the guys went next door to our site and asked the nice surfer guys there for beer.  They left at 6:00am.  Well, exhausted as I was and with earplugs it was a rough night.  Barbara slept thru it all.  I complained and about 5 sites got their money refunded.  Yeah!            We left that day and went to a lighthouse -Yachats.  We had our second breakfast at the restaurant at the road leading to the lighthouse. We were whooped from the day before.  I have not mentioned this but our group is older.  Barbara loves coffee and Jeff and Steve drink ice tea for lunch.  We stop every hour, sometimes twice an hour to use the restroom. It works out cause we all need it. Did you want to know this?          We have gone through two tunnels - they have a light that warns motorists that we are in it and to slow to 30.  You can see the light at the other end - but the scary thing is the noise.  A little yugo sounds like a jet plane going by you - so imagine several trucks going through at the same time.           For lunch we stopped at the DRIFT INN in YACHATS.  Stop here!  Great food, not cheap, but not bad.  I had the best stir fry with halibut and ordered to go sweet potatoe empanadas and the treeclimber -spicy rice and beans with chips and Jeff got the burrito.  They were super about wrapping the food for us to go.  I had coffee - decaf - a bit chilly out.  It was $25.50 for lunch, drink, snack, tip and dinner.           We continued uphill through a tunnel to Honeyman SP.  We stopped at Safeway - a nightly affair (I got smart and got a card to save $ - on the spot)  Debi in the meantime had gone to Florence, gotten a room and put her bike in it, driven to Eugene and parked the van and ridden back to Florence to meet us in the morning.  We briefly said ""hi"" and went to the campground - 1 mile away to camp. There was no hot water - well, Jeff got some and Steve got all soaped up and then it turned cold. No shower for me that night. Had the great take out from lunch and Jeff had a red & white checked table cloth and cookies to share.  Great way to end the day.            It was raining in the morning as we ate breakfast at the hotel where Debi spent the night.  She was riding with us today!  We stopped in Noti to see Barbara's sister - Dianna.  She had a nice sign out front for us ""Welcome Team Blast"" with our names.  She was off route 126. Barbara had not seen her place and was excited to do so.           We stopped at a bar and pub and had a nice lunch - fried halibut and salad. Sound familiar?  They had 75 cent tacos.  A group at a table had 5 tacos so I went to the bar to order one - they were out.  The table said ""Here have one!""  I am not one to say no to food.  Very nice of them. I wolfed it down.            We continued out of Noti getting onto Crow Rd staying off of 126.  Very nice rural scenery.  When we got hooked up again with hwy 126, Jeff found out that the bike path had been extended so we went straight over 126, over the RR track and then 1/2 mile to pick up the extension to the trail.  We went to the youth hostel and upon seeing the age of folks - half our age, the lack of privacy, lack of space for our gear, Jeff pushed to move for the hotel.  It would have been an experience to stay there but glad we got to the hotel.     Jeff got us two rooms and insisted on paying for them.  We bought him dinner which in no way made up for the rooms.  We are at the PHOENIX INN on FRANKLIN RD close to downtown - REI.  We took all bikes upstairs and spreadout.  We decided to stay there the next day, our layover day - for $88 ($22 each with AAA discout).  They locked the bikes in the conference room - no meetings.  The breakfast is wonderful - make your own waffles, cereal, fruit, yogurt, sweet bun stuff.  There is a frig and microwave in the room.  A great deal.  Thanks again, Jeff.  Jeff headed home today - our coastal leader will be missed.  Tomorrow we head out after a great b'fast."
278,"I cleaned my bike as it was filthy from the all the rain on the coast. I took a 2 hour nap while everyone did laundry, pocketmail, shopping etc. I also did my strengthing exercises that have been helping me with my hip and arm. We had mexican for lunch and left-over thai food for dinner.           The next day we had flat lands again and hills on either side of us.  We will be following a river all week.  Today it is the Mackenzie River/canal.  This water supplies power for Eugene.  We stopped along the river as a woman was coming out of her driveway. She let us go onto her property.  She lived on an island.  The property used to have the canal go around one side but Eugene needed more water flow so they had the canal go on both sides of their property.  The trees didn't do so well for two years but this year were coming back.  It was gorgeous.  Her husband tinkered in antique cars because they had a garage stating 'antique cars'.  We continued in the valley and came to Tina's Lucky Logger.  Well, we sure were lucky.  They had for $5 get one sandwich, chips, potato salad, cookies & fruit cup.  I ordered two sandwiches for $6 - none of the extras came with it.  When the order came they royally messed up.  Paper bag after paper bag came - the waitress said ""Just take it - the cook is crazy"".  We ended up with, instead of 2, we got 4 potato salads, chips, fruit cups.  We ate beside the road and the canal. Three young men passed us as we were eating.             The trees are now large pines.  We stopped at Harbicks in Mackenzie Bridge and got food for dinner. I got bagels, macaroni and cheese, tomato for the sandwiches, & jelly to go with almond butter/honey roll ups. I had the left over potato salad and made a club sandwich with the tomato for dinner and had a fruit cup in my cereal the next morning.           We went another 5 miles after our shopping and snack to Paradise Forest Service Park.  The river ran right alongside the campsite.  It was gorgeous! We had met the 3 guys that passed us at lunch. They had just graduated from U of VA (this is where my cousins graduated).  They ended up spending the night at Paradise SP with us - primitive. Robert had a bum knee so I gave him 3 celebrex. They all had the same bike so they could interchange parts. Two had bobs and Robert had panniers.  It was their graduation gift.           The next day we would be climbing over the Cascade Mountains.  There was debate as to whether to go over Mackenzie Pass where there was ice or Santiam Pass. Mackenzie after 11 miles had no traffic but it also had no shoulder for those 11 miles.           In the morning at Paradise I went to the bathroom and when I came back there was something rumbling in my rainfly.  I shoke it and it was running around.  I opened my tent and a chipmunk was in there.  It ran out and I found that it had eaten a hole in the screen near my feet.  I duck taped it and it is okay.  Better that than the fly.  I have now been hanging my food from the trees.  It got a little of my bagels.            We decided to go over Santiam pass cause we did not want to turn around if we ran into ice. The pass was 30 miles up hill, 3-5% grade.  Closer to the top it was more than 5%. We stopped at a waterfall and saw the top one of the three falls.  The chipmunks came out in droves for hand outs.  A fair amount of tourists were there so they must be well feed.  I did not give handouts as I had already donated to the cause.          For lunch we were going to stop at a forest service park that had food listed on the map but when we went down and around a corner and were looking into a steep downhill into a dark dungeon, we came back up and ate pb/j rolls near the road! When we got to the top of the pass it was much cooler and very windy. But it was downhill from there into tall pine trees to Sisters.  We got in at 6:00 pm and went straight to the pizza place in Sisters - Barbara and I split a medium spinach, garlic, tomato pizza.  There is also a good chinese restaurant and The Gallery restaurant. I went there after pizza and got a huge piece of strawberry pie - lots of vitamin C!! While eating pizza 3 guys came in and said ""It's Team Blast.""  David, from Minnesota, had been reading our website .  He is riding self-contained and is traveling with a father-son he hooked up with from Adventure Cycling. The son is not riding and the father is going to the overnight spot and riding back to meet David.  David is a teacher and gets 2 1/2 months off cause the tourist folks have lobbied that they need the kids to work during the season so school does not start until after Labor Day.  That means one week for winter break and so springbreak. He is heading for a different route than us, ending up in NY City to check it out. He saw Robert and the other two guys who ended up going over MacKenzie pass (the more beautiful route), there was no ice.  The celebrex must have worked cause Robert was doing okay.  He did not want to even bend while walking in the campsite.  If you think I eat a lot. The three from UVA would get ahead of us and we would see them stopped at restaurant after restaurant.           We stayed in the city park in Sisters for $5 and had warm water and toilets. They did have campsites.  We then went to Ochoco FSSP and had hot showers and were on a beautiful lake.  It was a long day but flat. Three of us ate lunch at a mexican restaurant in Prinville.  I had left overs for dinner and Steve bought rice and beans for $2.50 each and got an entire styrofoam box of each. We ate b'fast at the RV/restaurant across the street.  Had V8, french toast and a good chocolate cream pie.           The weather is very dry with a nice breeze.  Our noses are dried up.  I am using Ayr nasal gel and it is helping. We went into headwinds up Watako pass.  At a stop on the side of the rode a guy named Mark was doing the route from Iowa to San Diego. He had a mountain bob, two panniers and a bag on top - he was young!  He had gotten laid off and was glad.  Mark was going to get back in time for RAGBRAI - their state party! ride of 10,000 people. The scenery continues to change by the hour, less or more trees, bigger or smaller due to the valley and mountains.  We always see mountains in the distance with snow on it. They water the weeds to feed the cows and horses.  It is even a wet year.  The vegetation on the side of the river is always greener.  There are ranches every few miles or more.  It is a problem using the restroom because every rancher has his land barbwired off right next to the road - to keep the cows in or people out or to delineate their property.           At the top of the pass Debi had to put a tire piece into her tire because her brakes had rubbed the tire.  I need to bring spare rubber pieces in the future for things like this.  We all went really slow down and ended up at the bottom in Mitchell.  The town had four buildings.  We stayed in the city park with restrooms across the street, paid $2 for a shower and did laundry. The mercantile store had everything - it was like a mini Wal-mart - grocery, personal items, horse shoes, clothes, videos, butcher, hardware store.  It was wild - the owners are new and doing their best to get everyone to use the store by offering everything.  The owner called his wife and she bought a tire for Debi at Wal-mart and did not even charge her a profit.  Debi tipped her.           In the town was a bear named Henry in a cage - too small if you ask me.  He was found on a ranch and had been declawed.  His poop was orange - they feed him carrots and dog food.  The owner can feed him a banana from his mouth.  He gave him salmon once and Henry got agressive so no more meat for him.           The next day we went up Keyes Creek Pass - 4.5 average, 1:18 hr and 6 miles.  On the road, Barbara guesses it was Cycle Oregan, were the words ""Keep pedaling, Almost there, Many have tried, few have succeeded (smiley face with two x's for eyes, slanted line for mouth and tongue) but U R awesome!.   Good Job!  a smiley person   Great job!"" at the top.           At the top we saw a helicopter that had a long line from it. It landed so we went to find it and they were refueling.  It was a logging copter.  The line hooked up to 6,000 pounds and the pilot could drop the logs electronically.  This does prevent logging roads & dragging trees that destroy habitat.  They log trees marked by the Forest Service - even old growth trees!           After the pass we sailed into the John Day Fossil Park area. They have 20 square miles of gov't property and 10,000 sq miles private and gov't. The fossil beds are post dinosaur.  There are 695 spots they dig but do not tell anyone where they are due to pillaging.  If a fossil is taken it is like tearing a book out of a page with no numbers - it is meaningless.  They are attempting to preserve and learn of our history thru these beds.  There are three locations but we only stopped at one.  The stones were green at the new museum/lab.           We spent the night at Austin Junction - the only place around for miles.  This used to be a 2,000 population logging community.  When logging died out the FS removed all buildings.  We stayed in the back of the restaurant.  We ended up eating dinner there so that our stoves would not be lighting up in the woods.  The food was good and the owners very nice and helpful.  There is a huge english bar mantel placed in the restaurant.  I had eaten lunch in Praire Junction - the cutest town we have been through.   The buildings were redone and western.  I did not take a picture unfortunately.  I ate at Chucks Little Diner - it was good food and had a great ambiance.  I got a carrot cake to go which lasted two days. Ate some at Austin Junction & Baker City.          In Baker city I am spending lots of time on the computer so I am now going to the famous Mexican restaurant here.  We did laundry last night and cooked our meal meant for the night at Austin Junction.  Prior to getting here yesterday we went up two passes at 5,000 ft - and started these at around 3,500 and 4,000 ft. Getting used to these hills - they are gradual and my new 20"" chainwheel is great.  The headwinds have been a bogger - sometimes up to 19 mph but mostly around 10 and they change as we go around passes."
279,"          We had a great time at Baker City.   I send mail home, did the journal, had great Mexican food at El Elederro (sp) and went to the Oregan Museum that has the largest rock collection in the U.S.  The Smithsonian wants it!  The rocks were incredible - varity, color, design.  Two sisters started the collection and others added to it.  One gentleman collection of rocks had been cut and polished by him. Every rock had beautiful colors and designs in which nature scenes could be seen. There was a room that had ultra-violet light and when the light was turned out different minerals caused the rocks to glow orange, green, purple and red.  I then went to see the movie ""The Terminal""  - I recommend it.  Beth and her husband Jan were camping next to us. They both have recumbants and are pulling trailers with two wheels and yellow top - not sure of the brand name.          The next day we went to the Oregan Trail Interpretive Museum.  Debi and went thru it, me taking digital pictures of the info hoping to read it again later and Barbara and Steve walking to the original wagon trail tracks still in the ground.             The rest of the day was hot - 104 degrees with mountains and sagebrush. We got to Richland and rested for an hour.   The mayor is a retired English teacher who is a 4th and 5th generation from the town.  She won by 5 votes because she wanted progression in the town.  Here is her agenda:  $800,000 for a new eater treatment facility, $2.7 M grant for new sidewalks and trees, and she started a crappe (sounded crop - e) tournament to bring in revenue.  Not bad.  They do not have water meters.  They have ditch and creek walkers who go out and meaure how much water is removed from the creeks by the farmer.            We then went up Summit Pass, 104 degrees and 6 miles up a steady 5% incline.  It was the worst yet due to the heat. we dubbed a name not to be repeated here, but it is Eddie Murphy's favorite hill. We dubbed cause we thought it did not have a name, so now it has a double name.           Debi did get a ride up the hill by a big truck.  She said she was going to reconsider the trip.  Happy to say at this point that she got stronger and stronger and is finishing. She tore down the hill and I stopped to take pictures of the storm coming and caught up with Barbara.  The road went left to Halfway and right to the next town.  She did not know where Steve and Debi were. So we hauled it on the flats, mostly she did and caught up with them about 3.5 miles out of town.  It was dark and about 7:00pm.  I suggested that we turn around and stay at Halfway for the night due to conditions.  The rest voted the same.          On the way back into town a girl named Sara Young from the town rode with us and took us to the Hotel/Campground. Sara is Barbara's daughter's name and Young is Barbara's maiden name.  Pretty cool.  Her family has a website and they do yearly weekly rides with a sag with the age ranging from 13 to 74 years.           We were exhausted and sat numbly eating our food at a local restaurant. I had vegetables - a rarity on the menu out here. I had laid my rain fly on a wooden shed at Baker City to dry out and now it smells like mold.  There is none on it.           We left Halfway and went to Oxbow and Brownlee Dam.  Barbara had a flat on the Oregan side of the bridge and rolled across to Idaho so as to have one flat in OR.  They have a plant named goathead which punctures tires - so we will keep our tires away from all green or brown stuff. Prior to the dam we stopped at Scotty's and had a V8 and a pie - those things are 520 calories so no more for me.  They had real bison skulls on the store wall and they came from a lady who was there at the moment whose family has a Bison ranch.  She said it is the best meat to eat - no hormones, grass fed, & lean. I will buy that at home now. The scenery was now tall pines and along the river which we will be along one the entire week - different ones.  These are clear - not as the Powder River.             We had Lunch at Gateways - fries and chicken. That and hamburgers are the standard fare out here.  However this lady put hamburger in her beans - almost southern.  We climbed after this and our bellies were aching from the food due to the heat.  We stopped on the side of the road and got wet in the very cold creek.  Took my shirt off and soaked it, B & S stuck their feet in, we put our bandanas in and soaked ourselves. Barbara and I bought silicon neck scarves that we soaked.  These keep our necks cool and thus our heads.  This saved the day!!!            My bike, a Robert Beckman Sakkit, is shimming on downhills and will continue during the week going over 17mph.  Putting my knee against the top tube is great for those 25MPH downhills but hard when I have to pedal - knee - pedal....             We stayed in the back of the hotel in Cambridge - had showers and did a shared load of laundry.  It was so dry the clothes dried in half an hour - cycling shorts included.  Had some wind at night and showers.  It was cool and a little drizzly in the morning.  I had bought a nectar the night before and washed and peeled the label off - it broke the skin to the nectar.   I was a little tired but okay.  I stopped at a restaurant where Barbara & Steve had another breakfast.  I did not feel like eating so had only a V8.  I called the Nemeroffs from Atlanta but they were leaving the next day and their house is in Garden City, 60 miles south of where I was.  Leah and Kerri are students of mine.            I got into Council and luckily stopped at two stores for drinks.  I had Montezuma's revenge.  I did not feel badly but had to keep going to the restroom.  I bought a gallon of water and kept drinking.  I also used Shaklee Performance to put back in electrolyes.  By the afternoon I was doing better and by the evening it was gone.  After Council I had a biscuit and egg at Granite Mountain Cafe. Awesome, better than the Flying Biscuit in Atlanta. We ended up at Zim's Hot Springs right down the road.  All the water is 108 degrees.  They have to pump the water up to a tank to cool off so it can be used.  Want a bath?  Pour the water and wait an hour or you'll get burned. If the cool water runs out you will scald yourself - I almost did that cleaning my contacts.  The best thing is though in the winter when you use the restroom - your toosh warms right up! Well, I had warm water from the hose to hand wash my clothes.  My secret - Dr Bonner's peppermint soap (aw, the lovely smell) and Shaklee Basic H for more cleanliness.  We wash in a plastic bucket from REI made to carry water.  I also put this in my pannier and put my tent in it which is wet 99% of the time.  Keeps the panniers dry.   The morning was cool and drizzly. It was downhill with beautiful trees and by the river.  Stopped in Pinehurst - no tent camping unless you get a cabin. No outside toilets or showers from the cabin.I was disappointed and furious that my was shimming so much going down great hills that I wanted to peddle on.           We got to Riggins and the folks were fishing for Salmon.  Too cool - lots of people.  The Indians were there.  They can use nets and the white people can not.  The Indians sell fish along side the road.  The rule of thumb - don't buy unless you see them catch it.  They had to take a cleanliness class, have an ice chest with ice and sell the fish within a certain time of being caught.  A Fish and Wildlife man told me that the fish are not wild.  They have a hatchery where they get wild salmon eggs and let them grow to about 3"".  When they are that big they remove the adipose fin (Do they put antibiotics on it -No and does it hurt?  What about that hook?) and release them into the rivers.  They then grow and return.  The fishermen can not keep a salmon with an adipose fin because it is a wild salmon; those without are from the hatchery.              We ate at Lucile a town of 50. We passed a mine shaft and it is still being mined by a guy who does get a bit of gold out of it.  Did you know there are Chinese miners that were in Lucile?  The restaurant was JC's River Grill and had great food.  Bert the owner came out and talked to us about rattlesnakes and the town.  Patty Beymus is a character I need to look up from these parts.  I asked our waitress Tina tons of questions and it not being busy she was happy to oblige answering.  She told Debi that she could hear a rattlesnake over her 4 wheeler!  Stay away from pipes - snakes like to go into them.  Some kids got bit and the ambulance did not have anti-venom.  Strange.           We stayed at Swiftwater Park at White Bird.  Modern and pleasant on the river.  Well stocked with food from Costco.  I have a whole box of macaroni & cheese, tuna and applesauce.  Wonderful!            The lady camping next to us told me that they do accelerated reader at their school and their daughter who is on 4.3 can only read 4.3 - nothing above and nothing for pleasure.  I was astounded at this stupidity. This is how you create an unwillingness to read and remove choice - life is choice.  Still amazes me.            The next day we climbed up White Bird.  We went the alternate route.  10 miles of NO traffic and 26 switchbacks over 6 miles of up and traffic.  We had heard for 3 days about how bad it was.  It was pleasant - cool weather, not steep.  I did great up and for the rest of the day and paid the next two days but no regrets. It took 2 hours, 11.6 miles with an average of 5.3.  This is great for me and my lungs.  I did Reiki the night before and Interface that morning - energy work and drank Performance. It worked. And it was downhill the rest of the day.            I had a frozen mocha at a retired B & B on the river and then I had a mini hit the wall - 4 miles from Wild Cherry FSSP outside Lowell.  So I stopped in Syringa at a new restaurant, open for only 9 days and had potato salad. ROW was the place.   The waiter was Danny and he told me the town was smaller than Lucille.  The residents were retired and lived up the hill.  They were mostly vegetarians and had great organic gardens!  One person had a kiwi tree. Danny is about 28 years old and he showed me a picture of a guy who was 84, tall as the trees and lean who Danny could not keep up with hiking up 2000'.  He said the guy was running down the hill, was as graceful as could be.  I think he fell and rolled right over onto his feet (must have had a good PE teacher or was in the special forces or just learned on his own). The Wild Cherry campground was on the river and I took a sponge rub down on my face arms and legs.            We went from Lowell to Powell and stayed near the Lochsa Lodge (lock-saw) in a FS campground.  We saw a moose alongside the road and creek.  On the way to Powell we say a baby bald eagle and the nest. It could have been an osprey but we like to believe it was an eagle.  We gat a little rain on us but it stopped by the time we got to Powell/Lochsa Lodge. Beth and Jan were there and we met Rob who ate dinner with us at the lodge.  He was doing the Lewis & Clark by himself in sweltering weather - so he hoteled mostly and ate out. He helped Debi with her bike - seat and gears.  He went home from Missoula to his new condo in Detroit.  The place had flush toilets and pay $2.50 for a shower.  Debi took one and Barbara & I stayed dirty for our 2nd or third day.           The next day we went over Lolo Pass.  It was shady the whole way and like the others - gradual.  At the top was a Forest Service rest area.  I talked the entire time to Lem Mitchell, an Native American .  It was very informative.  He says it is their country and they are the lost people.  The tribe gives casino money to improve hospitals, to retirement communities, to the U of Idaho, to local schools, Indian or not.  He said their nine counselmen, unfortunately are like our politicians.  They don't listen or care about what the people want.  Indians speak their native language to the children, teach them the ways of the Indian and the kids are eating junk food, watching TV and doing nintendo.  They encourage going to college or tech school.  He said they do not get money from the governement and are like everyone else - want the best for their children & have to work for a living.  Here are some books he recommended.  They are researched.  ""The Nez Perce & the Opening of the NW"" by Alvin Josephy and ""Yellow Wolf, His Own Story"" and ""Hear Me My Chiefs"" by L.V. McWhorter.  ""Tales of the Nez Perce"" by Donald M. Hines.             It was downhill into Missoula where we arrived at Adventure Cycling after getting lost in town. We had our group picture taken and an individual.  I bought a TransAm T-shirt, got a pin and talked to Larry about my bike situation.  Might have to look into buying a new frame - Co-Motion or Independent Fabrication.  The big companies are the way to go after talking to him.  Missoula has an Out to Lunch every Wednesday and the restaurants have food to buy. I ate a plate of Indian food, waited in line at the Thai place, finished the Indian food and then proceeded to eat the Thai food.  I was not stuffed!
"
280,"         Found out that the salmon spawn one time and die.  The hatchery milks the eggs from the salmon like a cow.  The reason for decline is multi faceted - the Japaneses trawlers, the seals in Seattle are removed to CA and return right away and they eat 25 pounds a day.             I have found 82 cents and spent 25 cents for 8 packs of mayo and 39 cents for a Subway cookie.  Darby had a bike store.  The town was closed when we got there - but it had some really cute stores I would have liked to browse in.  We camped at the back of a motel.  There were three English people there.  Simon loved going down the alternate route that was gravel - he enjoyed the fear of it.  We went up the regular pass the next day to Chief Joseph. Had a mini poof tailwind to the climb. It was a 3500' climb. The weather was cool and the climb sloping. Totally awesome seeing the road we had just wound through.  A father with his son on a tandum had passed prior to us climbing.  At the top the son wrote ""I am here because I am doing the Lewis and Clark trail.""  Another man, unloaded, raced passed us up the mountain.  At the top he said this was interval day and he was going back down so he could climb up another 4 times!          Bonnie and Frans met us at lunch. We were all eating bagels and peanut butter.  I mix 2 packs of mayo and 1 relish with tuna for a sandwich. When I can I add avocado to it. They had an idea for a dinner: cook noodles, drain, add to undiluted clam chowder and add beans and salmon.            We stopped at Big Horn Nat'l Park.  This is where the white man slaughtered the Nez Perce in their teepees.  These Nez Perce were the non-treaty Indians who left.  Their lands had been cut by three-forths.  They were heading to Canada.  When the white soilders came to their teepees where they were sleeping for the night they were told to shoot low as the Indians were asleep.  The Inidans awake and held off the whites.  However, the white man burnt the teepees with innocent women and childern in it to burn to death.  Burial is very important to the Indians as evidence of Etowah and other burial grounds.  They had to leave their dead and not give them proper burial.  Chief Joseph and White Bird got close to the Canadian border and White Bird's group went to Canada and Chief Joseph decided to prevent his people more hardship and gave themselves to the army.  Then after all of this they were put on a reservation in Oklahoma for seven years - not able to see their people! Our inhumanity never ceases to amaze me. Didn't we do this during WWII with the Japanese - remove them and put them in camps?           The mosquitoes would land on us as we rode. We stopped in Wisdom and the mosquitos descended upon us so we got a hotel - the cheap one. There were so many mosquitos due to the rain and they were watering for their 10,000 bales of hay, Wisdom's claim to fame.  The only good thing about it was it was indoors.  We went to eat dinner - pretty good, had a buttermilk pie prior to dinner.  Good thing - we were there for almost 3 hours.  One cook, one waitress and one bus boy.  On the way out of town a plane was flying and it landed on the uneven, barely cut runway - the ground.            From Wisdom we stopped in Jackson where there is a hot springs.  We did not partake of it.  Bonnie and Frans had eaten at the lodge - they took three times to cook the bacon so we went to Rose's Cafe.  Jenny bought it from Rose.  I bought a breakfast burrito that was great - eggs, sausage, potatoes, cheese and salsa.  Water was much better there as well.           We went up Big Hole Pass and Badger Pass both 1000' climbs.  At the top of Badger I was eating an apple and Barbara saw a storm coming our way.  She headed down the hill.  I got my jacket on and went down into a freezing rain. I was looking over my sunglasses and inbetween the rain hood.  At the bottom it stopped and I stopped to wring our my socks and put on all the rain gear.  It continued warming up so I stopped and lured three minature horses over to the fence and petted them.           The town of Lucerne prior to Dillon had some old buildings that looked very interesting.  Due to the rain none of us stopped.  We continued into Dillon, home of the Patagonia outlet.  Did not go.  It was raining again.  We set up tents and went to eat Mexican food - it was okay.  We did laundry and had a nice area with tables and chairs to hang out in.  Leaving Dillon there was road construction so we road on 3 miles of potholes and mud.  Going to Twin Bridges we had a 7-14 mph tailwind.  We rode forever - 12 miles- looking at the ""S"" on the mountain ahead of us. You can locate towns by the painted rock initial of the town name.   In town we saw Beth and Jan.  They got there prior to the crowd.  We waited awhile, longer than they did, for our food but it was good.  Had pasta, chicken & veges and blackberry pie a la mode.          Prior to VA CIty was Nevada City.  It was 100 buildings brought to the area to reconstruct the mining towns of the past.  There was a general store, saddlery, houses, post office, carriage house, a music hall with old pipe organs/Wurlitzers you could still play for a quarter, one being from France.   Debi and I took the tour.  The buildings had all the wares of the time in it.  It was interesting.  The hotel had two floors and the second floor had an outhouse above the first floor outhouse.  How did the plumbing work?  I was not about to stick my head in there and find out!          At Virginia City, right up the road was a working old town for your second local tourist trap.  The campground was up a hill which was where we viewed fire works for 10 minutes and then I went to sleep.  It was a fairly good show.  We cooked out and Jan and Beth were there.  I told her about www.backcountyfood.com foods.  They are organic and great in a pinch.  Camping with us were one couple from Athens, the girl about the enter vet school; the other couple from Asheville, NC.  We would see them in Yellowstone. The GA couple had a stove called Trangia that worked on denatured alchol.  Not compustible and it worked.  My stove was having spewing problems.  At the date of this journal, 7-15, it has really had some bad days so I am very serious about using the REI return policy and returning my Brunton.           Leaving VA City we a 8-9% grade for 2.5 miles.  At the top was 1-2% uphill but the tailwind was so fierce that we were all moving at 20mph without much pedaling.  We then had a DELICIOUS, rolling, downhill into the sun with the sunbreaking out.  It was 15 miles to Ennis where we ate at the Pharmacy - scone, omelet and hashbrowns.  We went grocery shopping and general shopping, Debi for rain pants, Barb and I looking at jewelry.   The rest of the afternoon was mini tailwind; it was like the Silver Comet Trail (RR) the last 10 miles.  Prior to that it was a 1-2% uphill.  We met a group doing a 800 mile loop back to Missoula - they were sagged.  T  We ate lunch with the cows - interesting creatures when mixed, male and female.  Even cows think the grass is greener on the other side. They will stick their head through a barbed wird fence to drink water instead on of right at their feet.  Hum, maybe it was because they are higher level thinkers and they felt the water was cleaner on the other side or they saw what their fellow herd was doing in the water.  Two bulls made the same noise - a few deep moos and then a growling sound.  Were they protecting the herd and telling us to watch out?  Cows also put their foreheads/crowns together and push as if playing.           We finished at West Fork Campground.  We opted to stay there for $6 instead of $3 at the USFS and then pay them for a $3 shower.  They did not keep the bathroom stocked but they shower was nice.  It was mostly a camp for fisherman and people going on rafting trips.           We went to Yellowstone the next day.  The high altitude is a bit hard on the asthma.  Taking meds in the morning and after lunch.  We saw Beth and & Jan at the next campground.            We went into the Quake History Center. This quake hit 7.5 on the reichter scale but most impotantly it was 6.3 on the pre-scale. The quake caused a 100 mph wind that blew people/cars across the road.  All down the valley upstream the water rose and flooded campgrounds.  One lady in a lodge woke and jumped out her door just in time as her lodge fell into the water.  28 people died.  One boulder fell on a tent with the parents in it and the kids were unharmed.  One lady got out of her tent and swam to shore her dog following her.  The dog saved her several times from falling into fissures.  They thought the Hebgen Dam had broken which meant all the way to Ennis would have been affected but it had not.  It is a small dam with dirt being most of it.  So to prevent further disaster, they bulldozed a 50 foot deep trench for the water to continue flowing and each year it gets bigger so that the river will eventually be as it was.           We rode along this river into W. Yellowstone. Trees were seen at this point instead of valleys.  When we got on hwy 191 we had head, tail and side winds for 8 miles.  When in Yellowstone I went to the visitor information center.  My group got separated from me, but I found them at Wagon Wheels Campground - a 5 star campground.  My gears needed adjusting so I took it to Low Heel/Freewheel across from the visitor center.   They were very helpful.  In waiting for them I ate a chocolate pie, took a shower and set up camp.  I went back and started dinner at a superb barbeque place - owner was from OK.  They served cheese grits - didn't get 'em but would have for breakfast if they were open. I think it was Bear Country BBQ.           On our day off instead of journaling I took an all day van tour of the lower loop of Yellowstone for $45.  It was excellent.  Saw the Canyons which were not on our  TransAM route and other side trips with explanations.  The company was the smaller group.  Behind the Wagon Wheel was Ernie's which had great snack lunches and sticky buns.           Yellowstone is mostly burnt and it continues to the Tetons.  However, new trees are everywhere and are now 4-6' in height.  Man once again attempts to control nature and loses.  There was a huge fire in 1910 that killed a lot of people and destroyed towns.  So the forest service said ""NO FIRES"".  This has resulted in a very volitale problem.  The Indians had it right.  They would start brush fires to allow the seeds to open.  No new growth has occurred due to control of fires; a tremendous amount of underbrush has piled up to make fires even more dangerous, there is a loss of food for habitats...  Fire is necessary for all of nature's course and man has upset this balance once again.  In Yellowstone they saved the Old Faithful Lodge, the largest of all wooden buildings in the USA and the other buildings by spraying them with foam.  If we chose to live in nature - we have to accept that nature will happen - storms, fires, quakes, floods and do our best to protect ourselves - but I don't believe we can nor should we attempt to control nature.  They have reintroduced the wolf because removing it caused overpopulation of other species and affected the food chain. Why don't we learn from nature instead of trying to manipulate it?  The evolution of man is to realize that we are not the all powerful.           The Yellowstone lake has native trout and someone introduced Michigan trout which is eating up the native trout.  There are geysers poking up in the lake next to the shore.  The fishermen can catch a fish and put it in the geyser to cook it.  You can tell the temperature of the geyser by the amount or lack of bacteria in it.  All white it could be 240 degrees.  All bacteria does not die at boiling point.  It is said that a dog jumped into a geyser and a man took his clothes off to go in after him.  His friends said ""NO"".  One guy waded in to his knees to get his friend out.  He died the next day of 3rd degree burns on 99 % of his body.  The dog was spewed out of the geyser the next day because the oil in his hair caused a reaction with the geyser.  Not sure of the physics of that one.           The bison hang out near the geysers in the winter cause they are warm.  The quake of 1955 caused some old geysers to start again and some to stop.  The entire area is a volital earthquake region, a Caldron within a caldron. After getting back from the tour I took a shower, had pizza, called Clara, grocery shopped and saw Spiderman.           The next day we rode through Yellowstone and I showed them the Firehole Canyon waterfall.  Look for the elephant in the falls.  We had a bit of a wind going to Old Faithful where we ate lunch and checked out the Lodge. Everyone had coffee there. We had a tailwind and then westerly and then easterly, sometimes 21 mph, mostly 10-13 mph.   I fell outside Old Faithful onto gravel - the wind and could not get unclipped.  Gravel was better than concrete or dirt.  Hurt my elbow but it was my shoulder that hurt the next few days.  I massaged it and it helped.           We went to Grant Village FSSP and here the bear boxes started for three nights. FSSP do not have showers. They put us with Greg another biker whom Barbara had read on crazyguy.  He told us things about where we were going.  Met two other people who left an Adventure Cycling group to do their own thing.  The group thing was a bit much for them.  Once again problems with my stove and a woman had bought a Trangia.  I finally fixed the straps on the back of my bike so that they were not crossing!  Takes longer when you are older. I called the kennel and they said Chestnut was now hanging out with old farts to get more exercise and that he was stepping on his entire foot.  That means his knee is better.  I started to cry I was so happy.  I hope she was right!!            Here are some things for the bottom:  Monkeybutt powder, invented by a motorcyclist.  It is calamine powder.  Sportslick is antifungal for tri-athletes.  Aquaphor, bought at Wal-Mart, works great as well.          For writing notes: water proof journals from J.L.

283,"I had 'Chestnut' put on the top tube as I would not go on another long ride until he passed. I had to put him to sleep last February.  He was almost 15 years old.  The bike is orange in honor of his lab-chow color. In these past two years I have been changing seats from Brooks to a Terry Butterfly - okay I'd say; but I am Brooks gal. So to retrofit my seat I cut a hole in the middle of it.  It worked!  I claim 5% of every sales when Brooks catches on to this idea.  This means no pressure in the front and no rubbing as the legs pedal all of those miles (too much info - well, you can relate on some level, I am sure)  The best part about the Brooks is that the sitz bones don't hurt - the ole hammock seat for the butt.  Happy Trails to You!

284,"My name is Jason Thorne. I've just hit 38 years old. Spent most of my working life in computers, mainly support. In my opinion the job continues to deterioate as things become ever more automated. Instead of applying thought, knowledge and experience to a problem, we have scripted solutions to everything. This has helped me finally take the plunge and realise 15 year old dreams to travel the world. To use a bicycle for the trip is very much a new vision, having only rediscovered the joys of cycling a year ago. The idea is to spend about two to three years travelling the world. At my advanced age this feels something approaching the 'Last Chance Saloon'.  Everything is fluid, no fixed route, no fixed timscales and no idea!!! Being a sports junkie,  my initial travel will take in Euro 2004 in Portugal, the Tour de France followed by the Olympics in Athens. After this I have rather wooly plans to go to Australia and New Zealand via SE Asia.   "
285,"My bike is secondhand and to be honest is far too big for me. This may present problems further into my tour but I've done plenty of miles on it and feel comfortable with it. Time will tell. Here is the kit..... EQUIPMENT LIST Condor custom built tourer made with Reynolds 525 steel frame.Campag Mirage groupset.Mavic 521 Rims with Panaracer Pasela tyres.Ortlieb panniers front and rear (Roller Classic)with Ortlieb barbag.Shimano 324 SPD/normal combination pedals.Brooks Swift saddle.Hilleberg Akto one-man tent.Western Mountaineering (US company)Super Kodiak 7 foot expedition sleeping bag.Thermarest Ultralite sleeping mattress.Cotton sleeping bag liner.Blackburn front and rear pannier rack.Trangia meths burning stove.Optimus Nova multifuel stove.Adapter for Nova to fit to Trangia.Shimano SPD sandals.Pearl Izumi Bouldor SPD trainers.Race Face Aquanot waterproof cycling jacket.Protective (German company) Pemberton 3/4 length cycle shorts.Other cycle shorts, 4 tops, 1 fleece, pants and socks.Bikebuddy adjustable water bottle holder for.... Laken Aluminium .75 ltr water bottle.Roberts SW Radio for BBC World Service.Couple of books, one is Hans A Rey's book on Stars. For constellation gazing Toothbrush, toothpaste, deodorant, plasters etc etc.Some more stuff but you get the idea. Lots!"
286,"Only made about 10 miles slow progress before I was caught out by the fading light. Pitched the tent in a field in Ockley, Surrey and spent my first night listenting to weird animal noises for hours on end. Mistake No1...at the beginning of a tour, find a suitable place and pitch in suitable light. I woke up in a muddy field with the barest coverings of grass; The tent was caked in mud."
287,"I decide to abort the New Forest and head for Portsmouth with my last remnants of energy. The bike is way too heavy for me and as a virgin cycle tourist I have no idea how it should feel. The handlebars wobble around and it does not feel safe.....anticipating the sound of breaking spokes due to the colossal weight of the bike (and the colossal weight of the Podgemeister I have become this last year), I go through all my equipment and decide to send unnecessary stuff back to Mum and Dad. Managed to get rid of 4.5kg - front and rear lights that didn't fit properly as I don't plan to cycle in bad light anyway, minidisc player with associated discs, charger and adaptor and a heavy book, ""1000 places you must see before you die"". Picked up a discount pair of Oakley Gold Iridium sunglasses from the Oakley Warehouse shop in Gun Wharf. Work beautifully.   Went down to the ferry port and into the P and O travel centre. Lady said there was a sailing in 15 minutes and I could squeeze on. Had planned to go to Cherbourg but this was going to Le Havre, no dithering time, so jumped on...the ferry doors shut immediately behind me and within 5 minutes I was on my way. 5 hours later I left the ferry to be greeted by heavy rain, thunder and forked lightning. Nearly 10pm in France, wet through, alone and no map, I attempt to find a hotel with very few words of the language. First was full but the lady kindly phoned another local one and I had a room for the night.   "
288,"Absolutely knackered. Spaghetti legs have been replaced with that all over ache that comes with waking up muscles that haven't been used for ages. Get a map and then spend 3 hours trying to leave Le Havre as the only road out appears to be the motorway. Pretty town of Honfleur follows, then find a place to stay. Guess what, as I pitch my tent it starts slinging down cats and dogs. Uncomfortable night beckons. The campsite has no food or drink facilities but I am sent half a mile up the road in the middle of nowhere to the only place that can possibly help, a truckers cafe. Intimidating stuff.... a small bar with a handful of locals or truckers and me in cycling shorts and very few French words. The Slaughtered Lamb stare as I enter (great scene from The Last American Werewolf), ""un biere s'il vous plait"". Monsieur responds. Quickly. ""Pardon?""   It quickly disintegrates and we kinda converse. I have a meal there and try a couple of Snails for the first time. Edible.   "
289,"The aim is to get down to Portugal for the start of Euro 2004. I may go to the Algarve which is right on the south coast and the time aspect has concerned me. However, my get through France as quickly as possible theory is not helping. Today, May 3rd, I have done very little mileage, maybe 20, but the rest has helped. I'm going to take a minor detour to Poitiers and visit Planet Futurescope. Currently on the Loire River in a town called Saumur. A few random thoughts on France. No traffic. Empty villages. You can pass through them and not see a single person. Shops closed at seemingly random times. Virtually no litter. Why can't we behave like this. Beautiful stone buildings everywhere. No Internet Cafes. This is only the second I have found since I began, and trust me, I have looked. Beer is expensive :( I may edit this later but I'm tired, sunburnt (80degrees today) and need to find a camp.   A Bientot.   "
290,"I stopped for a couple of Biere pressions and a coffee mid afternoon in a pleasant town called Mirebeau about 20 miles short of Poitiers and my destination Futuroscope. The rain was sporadic, the wind still blew but I was determined to do the final slog. So I set off..... It chucked it down with rain, the wind blew so hard the rain was coming at me almost sideways and the light faded. The next 3 hours were the toughest of my biking life, even my fantastic waterproof jacket (Raceface Aquanot) let in bits here and there. I mentioned previously that I have no lights as I didn't want to cycle in poor conditions, well they were badly required here. Almost exhausted, late, and light poor, I paused at a town called Neuville and thought long and hard about continuing the final 8K. Decided to continue and my decision was rewarded - a 7km cycle path running parallel to the road to Futuroscope! The surface was beautifully slick and I made it to an expensive but welcome Hotel Ibis right next to the Science Park (Futuroscope).   "
291,"There were a lot of 3D films and IMAX cinemas, the kind where the whole roof is a giant screen and to be honest I think kids will enjoy it most. I spent about 7 hours there, which was enough, but the rest from the bike and my recovering backside were appreciated. Watched the Champions league semi final between Chelsea and Monaco on French TV from my hotel room. Despite shouting the house down when WE scored the second goal, it was not to be. Monaco scored a dodgy looking 'goal' via the hand of 'a git' and we then lost our shape in the second half. For those of you that dont know me and are inexplicably reading my journal (welcome!), I've been a Chelsea fan all my life. I'm not allowed to swear on this fantastic website (cheers to Neil Gunton), but I left many a choice word back in room 124 in the Hotel Ibis. Next year peut-etre."
292,"They have varied in quality and price from 30 to 52 euros, coupled with an evening meal and my budget has been well and truly blown. Never mind. I feel they have been worth it as I learn this 'touring business'. I have also learnt not to cycle on Interdit's (highway or motorway). France appear to have 3 road classifications, A's - Motorways, N's - National, similar to our A roads, and D's - Departmental, our B roads. I knew not to cycle on the motorways, obviously. However, cycling down the N10 from Poitier to Angouleme on a dual carriageway, I was pulled over by the local police. They said I couldn't cycle on the Interdit, put me and the bike in their van and took me 2 miles down the road, in the right direction thankfully, to a D road that I was allowed on. I'm still not 100% clued up on the legal situation but having giant trucks pass you is no fun anyway so I shall steer clear. Stopped at a fantastic campsite named Les Peupliers outside a town called Couhe.   "
293,"Apologies for punctuation on this journal, the French keyboard is different and if I fail to find the apostrophe or other digit immediately, I will let it go. Spent the night in a camp just outside the interesting town of Cognac and met my first fellow cycle tourist, Matt, a Canadian fresh from Uni. He is heading to Bordeaux also, but as a fit man, goes a pace I could not sustain. Strangely enough he is resting as well today and we bumped into each other again in this Internet Cafe. I can thoroughly recommend the place, LE3W Cyber Cafe in Cognac town centre, run by a charming young lady who has been playing Pretenders and Creedence Clearwater Revival for the past 3 hours! I will stay in the same camp again today and make a big effort to reach Bordaux tommorow, although at about 80 miles, I fear I will rest some way short. As an aside, my last place of work, Groupama in Croydon appears to have countless offices in nearly every town Below is a particularly fine example :)   "
294,"Luckily, Matt and I had miscalculated the distance to Bordeaux. It turned out to be around 60miles (95-100k) which I managed. The LonelyPlanet guidebook Cycling France detailled only two campsites around Bordeaux and although setting off at differing times, our common goal was to get to the town of Villnave-D'Ornon adjacent to the south of Bordeaux. It was a nice ride, maybe my favourite so far, with a little of everything thrown in. The wind abated for a day alas the rain persists. Coming up to a fortnight in France and it has rained every day bar one! Much rather have rain than strong winds on the bike mind you. Following my episode with the Gendarmes a few days ago, I have been staying away from N (main) roads. This is presenting problems however and getting lost approaching Bordeaux was the product of avoiding them. Every route into the city centre appeared to be an A (motorway) or N (main) road. I took a detour via an adjacent town called Carbon-Blanc and ended up on a long, straight road heading directly to the city. The camera didnt come out because I didnt feel too safe, but I wont forget the strange suburb of Cenon in a hurry. It had a futuristic aura, more Big Brother than Brave New World. One long straight road with a small roundabout every quarter mile or so. At each side were tower blocks, tatty in many cases and through the centre of the road ran a tramline which carried impressive looking 'bullet trams'. Kids were milling about up to no good and the whole place was in complete contrast to every other part of France that I have been through. I never made the campsite as it was approaching 8pm, I had no detailled Bordeaux map and my laden bike bellowed 'Tourist! Tourist!' when I saw another Hotel Ibis. They are expensive, they irritate with their one small bar of soap, no kettle or coffee, breakfast extra meanness, but they are comfy, the showers are good and I know they keep my bike safe. I wasn't about to take any chances with Bordeaux as I was knackered. Sorry no pics today as I cant get the computer to accept my card reader. Nothing much to show anyway as Bordeaux is not a city where I would feel comfortable getting the camera out. Having said that, it is a strangely beautiful city, not in a picture postcard way and I am at a loss how to descibe it - it has a certain vibe. Have spent the morning wandering a bit and will now make my way through the final part of France before I hit the Spanish border. Again, main roads look to frustrate my route and to the left of Bordeaux appears to be nothing but forest. I would like to go down the coast to Biarritz so maybe head to the town of Sore and then due west to the coast.
"
295,"Navigating an escape route from Bordeaux was not too difficult and I spent a couple of days cycling through one of Europe's largest forests. The terrain was very flat and the roads very straight so I put quite a few easy yet uninteresting miles on my legs. Very little traffic, get into my cruising gear and pedal, steering straight for about 5-6 miles through the forest, take a bend and then straight ahead again for another 5-6 miles. Rinse and repeat. The camping sites are nearly all on the coast so finding one proved tough. I pulled up in the small village of Hostens, usual stuff, a couple of shops, shut, and a few people. Very strange to then see a couple of cycle tourists approach with exactly the same panniers and barbag as me. Red and black Ortleibs. Similarities ended there though as they had spaceage comfy looking handlebars and just about everything else you could think of. They were a German couple in their 50's. They even had a guide book which talked of Hostens (this village in the middle of nowhere). She made me smile as she read from her book, ""Pah! Hostens - a town full of possibilities'. They were tired and there was nowhere to stay. I spoke to them briefly and then they disappeared around the corner. I pressed on and found a camping site in the town of Salles, about 12 miles away. It was late and I made the mistake of cooking before bedtime. I was attacked by swarms of midges. How they fed on my Deet repellant free body. Face and legs covered in red blotches in the morning. They still itch three days later. Never mind.     "
296,"  Apologies for the picture quality. This guy is walking from London to Cape Town Sth Africa pushing a fully loaded baby buggy! He started end of February. We stopped and had a few beers which totally blitzed my anticipated mileage but it was time well spent. Biarritz failed to grab me as I had hoped but the charming port of Hendaye right on the border took its place.    The hills around this area contributed to my decision in stopping early and that would enable me to spend tomorrow, Friday evening, in the pulsating town of San Sebastien (hopefully)! I stopped in a small hotel about 500m from a bridge into Spain. The man running the Hotel told me that all the locals pile over the bridge for all their cigarettes and alcohol as they are virtually half-price in Spain!
"
297,"   Beautiful place and very clean. I think that the fact that most houses are built of stone rather than brick was the chief factor. I only ever saw one road cleaner though so I guess the French just have a very responsible attitude to litter. Never been to Paris so cant comment about the capital.      Where are all the young people? I didnt see a single place where late teens and twentysomethings meet. I wasn't out late when I ws in a town so they may have surfaced later, but out in the country all the bars were frequented by middle age working men or pensioners. The young didnt appear to be driving much, apart from manic scooters, so I conclude that maybe the English have more money to spend as kids. Camaraderie. Everyone knows everyone, they all seemed to greet each other much more generously than the Brits would. Can't say that too many were interested in me or what I was doing. I had a great Anglo-French conversation with a man in a car boot sale at Alencon about travelling and cycling but he was the exception. Not that I was concerned by this as my French is very poor, it is just not quite how I expected it to be."
298,"I found the route into San Sebastian rather dangerous, I reckon to have walked about the last 4 miles and there weren't even any hills!    The only road in appeared to be N1, a busy road with plenty of dual carriageway as you go up that hill in the picture above. The traffic roared past me at speeds perceptively faster than the French were going. There was very few spaces in which to stop as they had those metal barricade things we have in England around the bends. I had no idea how far there was to go up this hill or mountain (I was about halfway) when suddenly all the traffic disappeared. Nothing came past me. Huh? Then came some cars with flashing lights, followed by bikers with flashing lights. I stopped at a small turning in the road and one of the bikers then motioned for me to stay where I was. Here is what followed.....        The traffic followed in queues behind, about one minute afterwards and my journey over this hill took ages. Couple this to the 4 mile walk into the town and I was ready for a nice rest. Well...... those of you slaving in your office look away now.    I'm no beach dweller but this was perfect, a beautiful town or city and spot to rest for a few hours. I'm off to find a hotel and some maps, hopefully I will have a nice time here tonight.  Bye."
299,"  I had a beautiful ride along the coast for a bit and even managed to hold onto the wheel of a triathlete for a couple of Kilometres. Then I headed inland to try and reach Portugal as quickly as possible. With hindsight this was a mistake as I ran into huge hills everywhere. The following gives a good indication of how this part of the countryside is hard on the cyclist.        There appear to be very few campsites in Spain compared to France, certainly off the coast anyway, so I splurged on a hotel yet again. The weather has been blazing hot from Day One in Spain but I'm certainly not complaining, there are plenty of petrol stations along the way to fill up with water.    Over exerted on the bike a few days ago and found myself fit for nothing but sleep, which is just as well as the Eurovision Song Contest was on TV. I nearly always seem to bump into it and musically it appears to have sunk to new depths. You have to laugh at the voting though, I remember Mr Wogan commenting on it a few years back but it now beggars belief! Talk about looking after your neighbour. The Brit song was a plodding load of pish, which made it about the 6th or 7th best song in my opinion! Fell asleep before the end and didn't wake up until 10:30 next morning. Another day of low milage then....oh well...never mind.    Have now picked up part of the route which follows the Camino del Santiago, a route for pilgrims which begins in France and goes all the way to Santiago del Compostela near the west coast of Spain. There are plenty of pilgrims around, the majority walking...thats a mighty long way."
300,"The country appears to be all mountains and hills. My legs are shot to bits and my mileage has dropped dramatically. The weather has been glorious since I crossed over from France but it hits 25degrees by 10AM and then continues upwards throughout the afternoon. I have now realised that I have to rise earlier, start pedalling by about 7:30 and really enjoy those first couple of sunny yet cool hours. I have yet to find a set of weighing scales but can confirm that I have already lost half a belly and one chin. Same again over the next month will do nicely. Trying to trace a route down to Faro in time for the Footy where I will no doubt add a chin back on. Cannot find a Launderette/Lav.o.matic anywhere and am now wearing tops more than once. No wonder Im given a wide berth in the Cafes! Burgos is a huge place but the tourist office, amazingly open, says that this is the only place to use the internet in the city until Cafe Cabaret opens this afternoon. Connection is slow and this is the only terminal so I shall not update the pages properly until I find a more suitable connection. Hopefully Valladolid, my next main town will have somewhere.    Correction , found a place. Excellent news as the owner, an English lady pointed me to a great campsite 5K outside of town. Have managed to was my clothes there which is a relief to me and those close by! Read a one of those lads'mags a year or two ago which listed 100 things you should have done by the time you reach 30. One was experiment with facial hair. The next in the list was ""Abandon facial hair experiment"". Well, the only reason I have a fuzzy face is because I didnt bring my Phillishave (which I regret, very light and loads of electricity available) plus I have just been very lazy. Looking a bit messy now and I am not used to having my top lip tickled so it will go pretty soon.     Did my first bit of wild camping abroad last night as I ran out of cash and there was no bank in the small village of VillaFranca. Pitched 200M off the road in a farmers field and worried about it all night. Couldnt really sleep so got up early and had a fantastic ride for 90 minutes. A stiff climb of 3K at 6 percent followed by 30K of flat or slightly downhill into Burgos.    On to Valladolid......."
301,"Seems worse now and my fears were confirmed when I checked the Michelin map which has detailed KM readings between roads. I put in a huge effort to get down to Palencia from Burgos and my computer said 48 miles at the end of the day. The map shows that I actually did 140K ish! This translates to about 85 to 90 miles. The good side is that I have probably been doing a fair bit more mileage than I thought but I have thrown my French maps so cannot work out how many miles I have done since I began. Will try and play with it and see if it will behave. As mentioned, big effort from Burgos. During the day you have so much time to think about all kinds of stuff and when the going gets nasty, negative thoughts sometimes hold sway. Each night always ends in sleep though, so no matter how tough it has been you wake up looking ahead rather than behind. Small mileage today (Friday) as the I'm not fit for much and Vallaldolid on a Friday night may be fun. Tempting fate, but I've had no punctures and not a single problem with my bike! You beauty.  Cannot say that I am enjoying things, but I've always been a miserable git so maybe I have been expecting too much. Maybe the enjoyment comes later when you reflect on your experiences, or maybe it comes when you can climb a hill without cursing. On to Salamanca next, I've studied a few maps and any further South and I will hit huge mountains.  Bye
"
302,"Gave up at about 7pm and looked at my map which showed a campsite about 10 miles away. Got lost leaving the city and when I finally made it to the village the campsite was shutdown and in ruins.  El stuffo. A Spanish cyclist in all his racing gear came by and spoke a few words of broken English. I told him I was on my way to Portugal and he seemed to indicate he knew of a place to stay. Follow me, he said. So I did, for about 2k up a big hill where he kindly presented me with the main road to Portugal, pointed to it and said...'Portugal'  Looked at his watch as if to say, you have half an hour of light left, better hurry...    er cheers mate..... Turned off some dirty, dusty road went a mile and pitched the tent in the middle of nowhere. A most unpleasant night. The following day I find that Im in some kind of sandy area and the bike is plastered it. Wet, gritty stuff. The bike now needs an overhaul and as I am miles from Salamanca I decide to head to the close town of Tordesillas. It turned out to be an uplifting day..."
303,"As I proceeded into the heart of the town, Tordesillas became a succession of small, narrow, but pretty streets. I then entered the Plaza Mayor, a kind of small market square from olden times which kind of represents the heart of the town. It had an OPEN tourist office and I read about the towns ancient and royal history. I do like to view architecture but I have not shown any interest in going inside these places yet. More importantly, they gave me directions to a cracking campsite just 1K outside town. Make that 1K downhill, outside town. Even better. The campsite was much like any other superior campsite, but I finally met someone behind the bar who was willing to talk a little!  Carmen was nearly 18 and worked at the campsite weekends. Her English was OK and she helped me with plenty of Spanish words. She wrote these down for me and they have proved to be very helpful in my understanding of how much I have to pay various barmen! Naturally, she didnt want her picture taken but I was not to be denied. Hola Carmen!    I also met a lovely couple from the Lake District called Jack and Cath. We had a good chat and they made me my first cup of tea since I left England. Jack helped out with my sand sodden bike and German guy called Paul also lent a hand later on. It may not sound much, but this interaction with people had been sorely lacking since my adventure began and without doubt provided my best day and a half of the tour.    My bike was in bits towards the end of the first evening so I decided to remain for another day. I ate in the restaurant there and had the most wonderful homemade fish soup, packed full of mussels, prawns, king prawns, squid and various other stuff. So good, I had it on both nights.
"
304,"   Thought Id leave you all with a charming picture of my tiger feet courtesy of Shimano sandals. ***Update 28th May 2004*** Well I'm leaving my feet on show, warts an' all! Salamanca is a pretty big city and like the majority I have passed, a river runs through it. Darn obvious really that back in the days, settlements would be based upon water. It often makes for a very picturesque setting, although this particular city failed to ignite me in any way. The Plaza Mayor (central square)was huge and very impressive but thats about it. Sorry Salamanca. My choices of destination are surprisingly limited as I proceed down through Spain. There is the question of how many miles I am willing to do in a day and are there any campsites around. Failing that, a town where a hotel will help me out.  Bejar was next port of call and the map showed that I was approaching unavoidable mountains. Although a small town, it still had the lovely blue tent sign on the map, indicating a campsite. Bejar is perched halfway up a mountain and the final climb was painful. I wish you could all feel how painful it was. Think of having a season ticket to Spurs and then double it. Anyhow I made it, but there was no campsite, no signs to it anyway. The small tourist office was closed (no surprise) and I ran into a group of five cyclists heading in the other direction. Usually when I pass cyclists I give a hearty Hola! but I tried my luck with a Hello! and although Spanish, they stopped and one of assisted in great English. ""We are on our way past a campsite in Candelario, follow us and we will show you"". Great! Candelario is an historic village, full of steep, narrow, cobbled streets. It also belongs or is close to belonging to the mile high club. Stinking climb at the end of the day, think along the lines of a season ticket to Leeds or QPR. As I was now in a group, I could not cry off and stop for a breather, so I pushed hard on the pedals in Granny One (explanation later) and we all made the 4K climb although I dropped a bucket of sweat along the way. They kindly invited me for a drink in the only open tavern and we had the local speciality - sweet red wine. Wishing them well, I climbed for another 1K to the camp with snow capped mountains as my backdrop. Rather strange as its nearly summer in Spain. Plasencia was only a short ride away the next day, 35 miles, and at least the first 10 miles were all downhill. Yet another historic town with an abundance of ancient buildings I was not going to see. The tourist office was impressively manned by three people and the girl spent five minutes briefing me on its various attractions. I went to the Plaza Mayor and 'people watched' for an hour or so with beer in hand. Wished I had taken a picture now. From about 7pm all the townsfolk come out and stroll around, most well dressed.  I just couldn't be bothered with the 10K ride to the campsite so found a nice sidestreet hotel for thirty Euros. It was too warm to get into bed as there was precious little ventilation so I slept on top.
"
305,"No warning and no alternatives for a cyclist. The map did indicate that the N630 was part motorway but surely there is some alternative for cyclists? I could see the old road about 400Metres slightly to my left so I walked the bike through a field and some muddy tracks and joined it, not knowing how long it would continue for. No way was I going to cycle all the way back to Plasencia. The road had been blocked off and I was its only passenger. Bliss! Please no Guardia see me. The coast was clear and I continued for a good distance, stopping once at a petrol station where I had a brief chat with an English husband and wife biker duo going to Faro for a Harly Davidson convention! The road then continued as it was meant to, the N630, a major road, still quiet though due to the adjacent motorway. Then over halfway into my ride the road just died on me again. Join the motorway or take a 40K detour along a small road! They had kindly closed off the old road with a cul-de-sac roundabout but I could see a sign way up ahead which said N630 Rue de la Plata. I had a nice roadside poo (Sorry! But this is the reality of cycle touring, its made me smile at least) and contemplated banging my head against something hard. The detour would of hurt me as much mentally as physically and probably prevent me reaching Caceres. So I pushed the bike along another trail and then hooked it over the barrier onto the main road. At this point I have no idea if I was on the motorway or not, but the red N630 sign ahead persuaded me to go on. I just hoped that the Guardia (Police) wouldnt drive by. Pedalling as fast as I could , I made it to the next small town and the road again became legal for me to cycle on. I think I'm becoming acclimatised to the weather, although blazing hot, it is no longer burning me. The last part of the journey was mostly uphill and after a roadside cafe stop of three halves and a coffee I felt spaghetti legs approaching. Decided to belt out a medley of Elvis songs and imagined I was infront of Simon Cowell and the Pop Idol jury. Yes, embarrassing I know, but it got me through the last part of the journey and you should hear my rendition of Suspicious Minds! ****Granny explained**** My trusty bike has not been named, it is just a Big Red Condor, but my gears have been. I have a Triple chainset and it is 8-speed which means I have 24 gears at my disposal. The three cogs are known as Big, Middle and Granny. Granny is actually a cycling term for the small cog which allows very low gears, i.e even your Granny could get up a hill in this gear. The main sprocket has 8 cogs but I only use half of them. Therefore, on a nice flat section I cruise along on Big 4, at about 17MPH, Middle 3 is used for slight uphill gradients and Granny 1 or 2 is as low as I can go, for those special moments uphill and in trouble! To give you an idea about Granny 1, you would be able to jog past me, easily. No pictures for now as I found a really nice hotel right next to the Plaza Mayor and all my stuff is there. At 58 Euros, it is my most expensive splurge of the tour, but the only campsite near Caceres has been closed down and I'm worth it! Going to try and find a pair of long trousers so I don't look so silly and have a cracking good Friday night. I think it is Friday, I honestly forget on this tour. 95K to Badajoz (roughly pronounced Badahoth) tomorrow. Eeek. No motorway on the map though, just some curly sections, which means mountains or hills. Oh well, never mind. How on earth have I got nearly 4,000 hits on this site? My Mum doesn't have access to a computer..... Bye.
"
306,"I decided that I could do without a 95 kilometre ride to Badajoz and decided to go to Merida, about 70k south of Caceres instead. A few people have said it was an interesting place and there was a campsite close by as well. There were some Roman ruins but overall Merida failed to impress. As with most of the Spanish towns I've been through, the construction industry appear to be very busy and new developments are cropping up everywhere. They do not sit well with the majority of existing buildings though, which are in various states of disrepair. Merida encapsulated this.    There was precious little to write about between the two towns, I think this is my abiding memory of the day, town, desert, town. Motorway construction is also occuring everywhere in Spain and several of them are just following a similar route to the existing National road already inn place. I struggle to understand this as the traffic is light compared to British standards. However, as most of it is single track and plenty of trucks pass by, I suppose it should increase safety. Maybe forward planning as well...Spain seems to be in the middle of a prosperous time.  The downside to the motorways are the deaths of the roadside cafes which have refreshed me along the way. Limited traffic passes by as the motorways open. My cousin Jeremy Miles is 40 years old next month (heh) and I found the perfect place for him to settle down on the road to Merida. No traffic due to the new motorway, very warm most of the year etc etc....    I am bumping into lots of English speaking people now as the tourist season sings into action. Met another couple on a Harley at the Merida campsite and also shared a beer with a few Spaniards...amongst them, Angel and his dad, Angel snr. Angel jnr was a Real Madrid fan , the others all Athletico Madrid, so I enjoyed trying to communicate with them about football. We took the pee out of Angel jnr as his team, supposedly the biggest in the world, lost their last 5 matches which also did for the coach. They bought me a couple of beers and refused to let me buy them one back, which was nice. Angel Snr was 66 and recently retired, but looked nearer 86! He was a tractor driver for 35 years and like the UK, 65 means enforced retirement. I mimed to him that now he will become a couch potato, drinking beer and getting fat, which amused him greatly. Salut to the Angels!!! OTHER STUFF. Spent another day at Merida campsite, mainly to give the bike some loving attention, decided to swap the tyres over as the rear one has been scrubbed by all the weight. Should buy me some more mileage but I will have to get a spare soon. I have two spare tubes but a slick tyre is asking for trouble. Talking of slick tyres, watched the F1 European Grand Prix. The usual spectacle of domination from the German. Is he really that much better than anyone else or does he just have the best car? Personally, I feel it is a bit of both. His Ferrari partner is second in the table and was second here, but it certainly doesn't make for exciting TV. First sign of back trouble since I started the tour. I have a scoliosis of the spine, which means it is curved. About once a year it really plays up and I can hardly walk! My condition is not serious, a mild version, but the expert who examined me back in Jan 03 said it won't get any better but can be kept at bay by a series of exercises. Cycling is good for it apparently, rowing is off limits.  In my last job I had to push a computer trolley around now and again. It turned out to be a constant companion for a week or two and was renamed Jason's Zimmer. I pray I don't require a similar device in the near future."
307,"Cycled from Merida to Badajoz, but I had a very frustrating time finding the Tourist Office and the city was a sprawling mess so I pressed on across the border to Elvas in Portugal.    The map showed just a motorway route to Portugal from Badajoz and I had a feeling of deja vu when sure enough the main road died on me and rerouted to the motorway. Luckily the two roads were completely seperate and so after pushing past a roadblock I was able to continue my journey on a deserted road. Elvas was, like so many, perched on a hill, so I had a beauty of a climb to reach my destination. The temperature has increased steadily as Summer approaches and as I continue South. Way over 30C, 90F every day now which is testing, to say the least. The campsite at Elvas was different feom the rest I have used as there was no grass to pitch on. I felt I would be sleeping with the stars for an evening but the sandy dirt surface took a tent peg with a bit of persuasion. I set off early next morning 7.30am to get some mileage in before the heat really kicks in. I've also lost an hour as Portugal time reverts back to GMT. Reached Evora at about 1.15pm yesterday. The Portugese countryside looks identical to Spain to me, except there appears to be even fewer flat sections. Lots of rolling hills. I can cope with this these days, I havent had to push the bike up any hill for nearly two weeks! Had quite a few hoots of encouragement from cars including a short blast of a siren from the local Policia! Thank you guys, it all helps mentally. Also narrowly avoided two snakes in the road. Both were about 3 foot long, one was very dead, the other had been squashed a bit but half of it was still slivering around. I have no idea if they are poisonous or not but if I go for a wee in the bushes I am going to be very careful! Before I reached Evora I passed through a town which resembled a building site and local tip combined. It is evidently a great source for marble and the pics below dont really do justice to the scale of the operation here.      I am staying in Evora for another day, the town is lovely although not for cyclists as the whole area has cobbled streets. The campsite is good and they have a great swimming pool which has just opened. Had a swim this morning, before the other campers descended. Beja is the next destination, then I have a problem. There are no hotels or campsites all the way down to the coast, about 130K. Part of this ride is also moutainous but I am going to give it a go by setting off as early as possible. bye."
308,
309,"   The journey to Bejar turned into a real swine however mainly due to the unrelenting heat. I would say it was my second hardest day in the saddle, not quite matching the 'Road to Futuroscope'in France. I took a couple of minor roads in order to cut off a few extra kilometres but whether they helped or not is debatable. The first shortcut was virtually a straight road for 20 miles, scenery was poor and the road surface was one of the poorest Ive come across, thus ensuring a slow pace. A photo below....    I took my customary afternoon beer and progress slowed further as the temperature rose. My map showed another shortcut across the largest artificial lake in Europe (according to a sign in the town) but when I rode through the town the road died on me and I could find no road or bridge crossing it.    I finally reached Bejar, early evening, after a cruel 8 hour journey. I prayed for a fair campsite, not the swimming pool luxury of Evora, but more than the car park feel of my first night in Portugal at Elvas. I got another car park. Broke several tent pegs trying to erect the tent using a rock as hammer. Here it is below...    Although I feel I have taken things leisurely, I have exceed my expectations of distance before I set off from home so I took another rest day, coz I can! Bejar provided the cheapest beer so far, 40p for a half, but the two or three clothes shops that had decent stuff in wanted decent prices. So I still remain without a shirt or trousers. Went and saw Troy after checking that the film was in English (with Portugese subtitles). The film didnt begin until 9:30 but the audience was full of youngsters. They got on my nerves as many were more interested in talking and texting on their mobiles than watching the film. The film was as expected really, an entertaining way to spend a few hours without taxing the brain or provoking thought. Did get one surprise though, they still have intervals here. So the film stopped midway and everyone went and got a drink for 10 minutes. The campsite was locked up when I got back to it around midnight, so I had to scale the walls. Met a nice 70 year old Dutchman named Siba in the campsite and he shared a drop of his Glenfiddich with me. Cant repeat one of the stories he told but he seems to have led an interesting life!
"
310,"Sure enough, after 10 miles the dreaded red sign appeared, no pedestrians, no tractors, no cyclists. The alternatives looked awful as I studied the map at roadside. A guy in a small van stopped, reversed his car back to me and asked  in dodgy English if I had a problem. He basically told it would be fine and that the police won't bother me. It gave me the motivation I required to continue on this route and just accept any punishment that may come my way. One mile later, at about 8AM, a big white van stopped on the hard shoulder 100 yds ahead of me after giving me a toot. The guy got out and asked if I would like a lift. These kind of things are potentially dangerous but I decided to take the chance as I felt that I was going to be kicked off this road anyway. He was called Caesar and spoke English on a par with my Spanish/Portugese, i.e One, Two, Three, Four, Five, Please, Thank You, Yes, No and Beer. I tried to analyse him quickly (I reckon I'm a good judge) and came to the conclusion that he probably wasnt going to try and steal anything. His van had seen better days but after about one and a half hours we reached Albufeira. He was going surfing further west to Lagos but Albufeira was en route. He dropped me off at a suitable junction, I thanked him warmly and gave him a bit of petrol money which was only accepted after much insistance. It was 9.30am and I predicted it was going to take me to 9.30pm to reach here! I then had to find the Albufeira campsite. Clipped into the pedals, went 200yds and would you believe it? There it was.
"
311,"This is the first update in almost two weeks and due to a run of Internet Cafes without picture download capabilities you will all have to use your imagination once again.... THE BIG WEIGH IN. Before I left home I got on Mum's scales, it didn't make pleasant reading, 13 stone and 4 pounds (186 pounds!). I flew home for a few days and got back on the scales. 11 stone 13 pounds (167 pounds!) I have shed 19 pounds in six weeks! Was probably a couple more but I have been living the high life for a week or so. I have not done much mileage on the bike since my last report on arriving in Albufeira. I've watched every game of Euro 2004, drunk too much, avoided all the hooligans, flown home for a couple of days and generally taken things very easy. Albufeira provided a drastic contrast to the rest of Portugal. Here was the coast, a stereotypical British tourist resort, full of lobster pink Brits in tacky T-shirts and floppy hats paying double or treble the prices that I paid in the last town, Beja, scarcely 80 miles away. Upon cycling into the main square of the Old Town (the 'strip'is a mile away) I was immediately offered Hashish, my friend,  followed by a couple of waiters hassling me to sample their culinary delights, with chips. Every meal comes with chips.  Albufeira was no doubt a beautiful town once upon a time, staggered white buildings rising from the coast up to the hills only half a mile away. The narrow, twisting streets are now almost blocked with stalls selling tacky souvenirs, overpriced clothing, flags, henna tatoos and CHIPS! Nevertheless it provided me with a few days of relaxation from cycling, English conversation and a fantastic Sunday roast in the Cavern Club.  My first bout of illness since the tour began occurred here although it was entirely my fault as I switched from beer to a particularly strong Sangria. The first jug was lovely, asking for a second proved to be a huge mistake. Halfway through I hit 'the wall' and had to make a quick exit. The following day was a recovery day in more ways than one. On returning to the bar two days later, the boss remarked to a regular with some surprise that I was still alive..... The campsite was huge, with a lovely swimming pool, a supermarket and a newsagents selling English papers printed that morning in Spain. I'm going to skirt over many details as I have left things for so long. I decided that Albufeira was not where I was going to spend the whole month watching the football, cycled to Faro and went home for four days after finding some cheap flights. The campsite at Olhao kindly secured my panniers in Reception and I locked my bike up and prayed that all would be fine upon my return from England. All was fine. Well, nearly all. I can't remember what I have done with my pump. I thought I removed it from the bike. I no longer have it. This is a great shame as it was a superior metal one given to me by a nice man called John Turnball who I met whilst cycling with the Anerley Bicycle Club last year.  Further problems arose from this loss as the plastic replacement I purchased took a bit of getting used to. My tyres needed inflating after the break and I was over zealous with the pump and sheared off the valve on the rear wheel! I also sheared off some skin on my hand in the process. Psssssssssssssssssssssss.  Flat. Curses. All this time avoiding punctures and I go and cause my first bike problem. I have a couple of spare tubes so all is well again and I am now careful with the crappy pump. Watched the England Switzerland game at the Faro fun zone on a giant screen with about 500 other Brits and it was indeed fun. I have decided to carry on cycling out of Portugal and along the southern coast of Spain, where I will still be able to watch all the footy with loads of holidaymakers. I will cross the border back into Spain today and see if I can up the daily mileage so that I may catch some of the Tour de France and maybe the Olympics.  Bye.     "
312,"Again a lack of piccies as I just can't bring myself to take a photo of the magnificent cathedral or other visually impressive buildings. Far better to take a photo of the celebrating hordes who packed out Flaherty's Irish bar last night to watch England play Croatia. Alas, my camera battery was in the middle of it's recharge! Gave my new shirt and trousers only their second outing and the barman promptly knocked over my full pint of Guinesss all over them. Cheers!  Seville is beautiful, matching the majority of women strolling around. Outstanding! This morning I spent a couple of hours walking around the Real Alcazar (roughly pronounced Alcatha), which is the Spanish Royal family's official residence in Seville. Very old and a grand mixture of styles. There is also some further excavation work taking place in one of the courtyards within, revealing even older structures (c 14th century). The only pic I have taken is of the 'baths' which were initially on two levels.    I didn't expect to be in Seville, but after reaching the Spanish town of Huelva early afternoon I realised I would not make Seville until rather late. However, Huelva had a large bus station (think English coaches) so I asked if they took bikes. Surprisingly this proved not to be a problem and will enable me to make rapid progress through Spain to reach the Tour de France if I so desire. About 60 miles down a motorway cost 6.30 Euros, which is around 4 quid. Hate to think how much it would cost in Britain.  I removed the bike from the hold apprehensively as the coach driver had a touch of the Schumacher's about him, but there was no damage apart from a kink in the front mudguard which should pop out. After locating the Tourist Office and getting a map of the city I struck lucky with the first Hostal I approached, as my bike was accepted. The bedroom is tiny, the bathroom smaller, and it is directly behind the small reception area. However, as it is ground floor my bike is inside my room (just), the shower is great and all appears clean. I was about to take a picture of the toilet for this site because there is virtually no room to use it but the door opened and the cleaning maid apologised as I was standing there in just my pants! What she must of thought of this crazy bloke in his underwear holding a camera in the bathroom doesn't bear thinking about. NeverMind ;) Previously I spent a day in a place called Isla Christina just inside the Spanish border with Portugal. You could tell just how close to the border by all the fireworks going off after Portugal knocked Spain out of the football tournament that night. Had a drink with two other travellers who were both alone, Patrick, 19, from Holland and Rahel, 22, from Basel, Switzerland. We chatted until the early hours and their company was most appreciated. Rahel, if you are reading this - go careful young lady!     "
313,"Can I say shit on here? Watched England lose on penalties again. The only consolation was the wonderful atmosphere created by my fellow sufferers in Tina's Bar, Torremolinos. Didn't get back to the campsite until 3.30am and I am nursing my second hangover of the tour. Cycling has proved to be a most successful way of clearing the head though. I could not find a way out of Seville on my bike, too many motorways, so took the bus down to Malaga on the Costa del Sol. I sat behind a young Irish couple who I saw in the Isla Christina campsite a few days ago. They have mountain bikes and are carrying their clothing and equipment in large rucksacks which doesn't seem to be very sensible. Their poor backs must be taking a real bashing each day. I then bumped into them again in Torremolinos. Small world. Malaga gets my vote for worst place of the tour so far. It smells bad too. The coastal road is highly populated with traffic and there is a smog over the sea. I'm not sure if it is a tourist resort or not, I have a feeling that people land at the airport and then whisk themselves away to a resort nearby.  Torremolinos was in the wrong direction so I headed east and spent the evening at a resort called Torre del Mar. Watched the Germans exit from Euro 2004 after losing to a reserve Czech side, who have impressed me througout the competition. I hope they can go on to win it, although Portugal will be very hard to beat with an extra man, the referee, aiding them. There were no other English people around at Torre del Mar, so I made the decision to cycle back the other way the next day and see England play in Torremolinos. I am now back in Malaga and will take the bus to either Granada or Almeria. I'm undecided on how to exit Spain. As mentioned before I want to catch some of the Tour de France and the coastal road appears rather dangerous. Will consider going inland a bit therby reducing the distance considerably.  Although I have not been cycling so much recently, I find myself enjoying the time I do spend on the bike all the more. My increasing fitness levels probably have a lot to do with it. The evenings have not been so great despite conversing with more people than at the beginning of the tour. It is nothing new to me though and I put it down to my lack of effort or reluctance to socialise.  After taking about a month to read the New Testament (strange reading choice possibly), I have rediscovered my voracious appetite for novels. I have about ten in my panniers at the moment - cycle tourists will probably recoil in horror at such an unecessary weight burden, but I think they are worth carrying and my fitness allows it. I can thoroughly recommend The Life of Pi by Yann Martell. Last week I read Steppenwolf by Herman Hesse. An old book (1927), it neverthless grabbed me as I found myself relating to the chief character. I've searched long and hard to find similarities with other people and this is the first time I have felt such a connection. I wonder if the work was somewhat autobiographical. Anyway, back to cycling.... I lost another baseball cap. Darn good Adidas one with a stiff peak. It didn't fly off my head, one moment it was hooked on my handelbars and the next it had vanished. All I have left is a Beanie which means I have to go shopping for another. I have plenty of time.......... Off to catch a bus.
"
314,"Ive been on a few coaches recently. Some may call it cheating. Its in the back of my mind that it is a bit, but I have been unable to find a route out of several cities so it has been necessary. Plus it enables me to get up to France for the greatest sporting test known to man, the Tour de France. I have enjoyed a nice ride from Alicante to the oh so posh resort of Benidorm (heh). The coastal route is a nightmare in places but this section was fine, with quite a few hills to overcome. Confession time. Ive drunk too much these past two days. Although a bit of lightweight when it comes to drinking, four pints of Guiness and a couple of Vodka and Tonics is more than enough for me. Will take it easy after Benidorm. The football will soon be over and Im blaming it for my frequent visits to bars. Had my first swim in the sea today - couldnt resist as I was following the coast and I was very hot. Trouble is that when my shorts dried I was left with those salty white stains  all over which make me look as though they havent been washed for three weeks! NEVER MIND. Alicante was interesting. I expected tons of Brits roaming around, maybe I was a different section but  I hardly saw one. Went to an Irish bar called OConnells and there were only six people watching the game (Holland v Sweden). The British boss said it picked up from 12:30 until about 4am but I didnt believe him as there were too many bars competing for custom. I left after the game and strolled down to the beach. Apart from departing football crowds, I have never seen so many people. The Spanish inhabitants swamped the beach area just before midnight. Young , old, it made no difference. I have no idea where they were all going, but everyone headed in the same direction. After getting lost for about an hour, I found my way back to OConnels which helped me pinpoint my hotel, which I also couldnt find. The manager had not lied - the place was rammed full with about 500 people. The DJ played some decent songs for an oldie such as I and I slept well. Benidorm offers a marked contrast to Alicante. The beach is undoubtably excellent but the Internet reviews of the nightlife paint a sordid picture! I shall try and grab a cheap and cheerful hotel, but Ive already tried two places and both were full.  After tonight I will start racking up the mileage as I proceed northwards. Spoke to an Antipodean (cant tell the difference between Oz and Kiwi unless they are together) who talked about the Running of the Bulls in Pamplona. It fits in well with my desire to see the mountain stages of the Tour de France, so come July 8th ish I may well be in Pamplona....running. Would be nice if I could get some video footage with my camera as the carnage begins but I know that short movies take up Megabytes of space and so I may not be able to show it. Some Portugese woman is shouting her head off on the phone in this room and Im about to tell her in good ol English to refrain from shouting. If this fails I will try shouting SHUT UP. No manners. Tsk. Will try and get a map of my journey so far up on this site tomorrow. Bye.
"
315,Sorry ;)
316,"It seems so long ago that I was in Benidorm that most of it is forgotten ,apart from that awful camping joke on the previous page, courtesy of a Benidorm stand-up comic. It was fairly clean there. Ermmm.... it does exactly what it says on the tin.... you get British food, British bars, British TV, British Cabaret, British youngsters throwing up everywhere after far too much alcohol. The majority of the clientele were decidedly young, not so much twentysomethings but teenagers. At the other end of the scale there were quite a few pensioners looking ridiculous with tans so dark they reminded me of dates (the ones that appear at Xmas).  The beach was packed solid, not even cat swinging room. For all that, I enjoyed the couple of days I spent there. Will not be going back mind.....         "
317,"Seems to me that Valencia is often excluded from our minds as a tourist resort, but I found it just as interesting as Seville or any other Spanish city I have been to. I have to confess to a complete lack of pictures to enforce my point though. I took the bus again. Can't remember why, it was too long ago. I made up for it though with plenty of cycling around the area. I have not been fazed by cycling around any of the cities so far (I'm in Barcelona as I write), it provides a different challenge to the long stetches of road between towns that I usually encounter. Sure, you have to be extra vigilant, but I have found most drivers to be very respectful of me, and I, them. As mentioned above, I clocked up quite a few miles exploring Valencia and rather like Bordeaux, I just felt something for the place. Found my usual resting place for the Euro Football, an Irish bar, and watched Greece beat the Czechs. There is nearly always someone to chat to briefly in these bars as like minded travellers head for a bar where they know that the Football will be on. Jasmine walked in at about 11:30, the football match long gone (especially for the poor Czechs) and asked a barman if the match had started. I helped out with the explanation that the game had finished and ended up talking to her for about half an hour. She returned to her friends in a nearby restaurant and I sank another Guinness. She then came back half an hour later and invited me to an Ancient Egyptian exhibition the following day. She was Swiss but also spoke English and Spanish, the latter helping immensely over the following days. Naturally, I accepted. We were not allowed to take pictures in the Gallery, something to do with the Egyptian government....but the exhibits were very impressive and very, very old. There were statues in almost mint condition that were 5000 years old. A jug, which appeared to be made of marble, was dated at 3000 B.C. I couldn't see a blemish on it. Everything was in Spanish, so Jasmine helped out with translation for me. I have forgotten the details but Jasmine was also on holiday and we travelled to Barcelona together."
318,"  There have been quite a few days on this tour which are no doubt lost forever from my mind. Often very little occurs worthy of note and days seem to blend. The Jasmine days as I'm naming them, are exactly the opposite. So many things foreign to my usual life occurred, that I can't remember chunks of stuff. Also, some of the information cannot be shared. Jasmine and I took the bus to Barcelona (Yes, I know it began as a cycle tour!) from where we got a train to a wonderful place forty minutes north called Arenys de Mar. Her parents have a holiday home here, just outside of the town, perched on a mountain. Stunning views aplenty. Alas, I kept meaning to get the camera out but never captured the view. Her parents had just returned to Switzerland so we stayed there and as Jasmine had friends in the town we went and said hello. Arenys de Mar is basically one long street, which leads upwards to the mountain. The most unusual aspect of the place the road is flanked on either side by sand, for miles. The road therefore is also covered in sand. Apparently, when it rains hard it gets a bit messy, but the locals seem to love it. We had an excellent meal, chargrilled asparagus was especially good, my fillet steak came on some kind of chopping board sprinkled with rock salt and  chargrilled sweet pepper, all washed down with a tasty Tempranillo. Although late, we then headed to the beach. Jasmine bumped into a bunch of friends there and we all had a great time at the beach bar! The young Spanish seem a happy bunch. Got to about 4AM and ten of us stripped off and went swimming! Fantastic feeling. The water was warm, although they all complained it was cold - they should try Brighton at 4AM...... Then onto a nightclub in town called Johnny's until 6AM and we finally got to bed at about 8AM. I'm not used to this. The next day was a wipe out, I didn't rise until 4PM the next day, but it had been the best day of my tour. Jasmine said she wanted to cycle to Pamplona with me. I had doubts as she doesn't cycle and I knew how tough it would be physically. We were also having a few difficulties, neither of us being particularly easy to get on with. She drove to Girona to pick up a bicycle and we set off that evening. We found a long cycle path that in truth was fit for mountain bikes, not tourers, but at least she was safe from the main road. She had an annoying habit of charging off (I was carrying her baggage, slowing me further) and when she took the wrong turning and I hit a 6 inch hole in the ground in vain pursuit, instantly puncturing, I was not impressed. Fixed the puncture and pitched the tent for the night. It was bad luck. I've had nothing but sunshine throughout Spain and Portugal but today it pissed down! Jasmine was probably having a tough time and when we went seperate routes for a while and agreed to meet later I should have heeded the warning signs. I arrived in the picturesque town of Olot on time at 10AM. Jasmine showed up in her car at 12! She still wanted to go to Pamplona, so I put my bike in her car and off we went via the Pyrenees. Three and a half hours later, a mile in the air, Jasmine decides to abort. No hard feelings, we had some great times and we said goodbye. Trouble was that she had left me on the blinking Andorran border, a Spanish town called La Seu. I was behind schedule for the Pamplona festival and in the middle of nowhere. Furthermore, that pothole has caused some rim damage to my front wheel..it probably needs replacing. To top it off, after spending the evening in the town, the following day is a national holiday. Not for Spain, just for the town!? So no bike shop. Crazy Spanish. The bus station wouldnt accept my bike on their vehicles, so I cycled 50K to the nearest town with a train station, Puigcerda, to try and get to Pamplona in time. Train to Barcelona took 3 hours and only cost a fiver. ******Barcelona update******  I've been in this amazing city for 3 days. Basically Ive been stuck here as everyone and his wife is trying to get to Pamplona. The few trains that run have been full. Got lucky today, although previously told that today was sold out, I have a ticket for the sleeper train leaving 10.30 tonight, arriving 5.30 Pamplona. Must tell you about their ticket queuing system as well. Beautiful, no really stunning, Romanian girl serving me Guinness so Moscow!
"
319,"I was in Barcelona about two weeks ago, it was the weekend and cheap accomodation was not to be found. I tried quite a few places, hostels and low grade hotels, but they were either full or unable/unwilling to cope with my bicycle. I don't blame them. No extra money for a bicycle, it takes up room and can damage walls or furniture as you try to negotiate it up stairs and around corners. I went a little upmarket, a 3 star hotel! It was getting late (Aside : Try to grab a listen to 'Getting Late' by Floetry. Great song.) and I had very few options. The lady on reception, about 30 with an intelligent look about her, appeared to do a quick analysis of me as I approached and spoke. I think I was in danger of failing her scan as she informed me they had no single rooms available, only doubles. I was not to be deterred. Smiling and trying to present the best Jason possible I said 'how much'. I won her over. She could now see I had brass in pocket and was probably charmed by this devilishly handsome English gentleman in front of her. Oh...sorry...yes we do have a couple of single rooms available. I had passed her test. It cost me a fair whack mind, 90 Euros. This is called 'credit card' touring and is the reason many cycle tourists avoid big cities. No campsites.  Variations on the receptionists attitude occur all the time and I am becoming pretty good at presenting myself and saying the right things to gain a room for the night. Barca - the main tourist road is called Las Ramblas, which has a pedestrian section running through its middle. An hectic place with artists, human statues, jugglers and outdoor restaurants all battling for the tourists' Euros. My hotel was very close to this road, which made the 90 Euro bill slightly easier to swallow. With the bike safely stowed, I hopped on one of the open topped buses and saw the sights. Went past the Nou Camp stadium, Barcelona F.C's home, wish I had paid a proper visit now. Also saw a lot of Gaudi architecture, impressive stuff. His masterpiece, La Sagrida Familia, a 120 year old cathedral is still being built!    It is not everyone's cup of tea, but I like Aquariums. The one in Barca was pretty good but suffered from overcrowding (people, not fish in the tanks). Unfortunately this is the curse of most tourist infested places. Watched the Blowfish for 10 minutes, hoping it would 'puff out', but it only does that when endangered.  Trying to get to Pamplona from Barcelona tested my patience. The main train station, called Sants, has a queueing system similar to the deli counters at supermarkets in Britain, whereby you grab a ticket and wait for your number to come up. The main board showed 563, my ticket was 740! It helpfully tells you the estimated waiting time on the ticket also, in this case 1 hour and 20 minutes. Hmmmm.  Everyone and his wife wanted to go to Pamplona for the Bull Running festival and all the trains were full.....for 3 days! I looked at the map and realised that it would take about 5 days to cycle and I'd miss the festival. I tried the bus station - 'No bicycles Senor'. I returned to the train station the following day, out of desperation really, but got lucky and there was a spot on the night train. I would have to share with 5 others in a 6 berth cabin but that was fine.
"
320,  
321,"They do not seem to have the platform guy who checks down the line and whistles or waves a flag as no sooner had the bike gone on the train pulled away with the door still open. One of my panniers was still on the platform and a kind man ran and grabbed it, handing it to me on the move. I struck lucky with my travelling companions, a bunch of US University students in their early twenties. The 6 berth carriage was of a similar size to an old style first class cabin in Britain, so there was precious little room. I was expected to put the bike under the bottom bunks, but despite trying for half an hour (more sweat) it just wouldn't go. In fact it got wedged halfway in, halfway out. Left it. Two of the girls disappeared early, the other wanted to sleep, so I went to the buffet cabin at the rear of the train with Jeff and Mike, both from Austin, Texas. We passed another American girl on the way, just, as she was of considerable size and the walkways were not. She moaned about the state of the train, we smiled. I have had virtually no contact with US citizens all my life, my travels have changed that as they are touring everywhere. A lot of them irritate me. They seem quick to express displeasure because things do not run as smoothly as back home. Get them in a group, especially girls, and they all seem to want to shout rather than talk, oblivious to the other people around them. Anyway it is a generalisation, Mike and Jeff were great company. We stuffed down a six-pack each and managed to get 2 hours sleep.  The train was due in at Pamplona at 5.30 am, we were told that we would get a knock at 5am to wake us. No one heard it apparantly. All I remember is waking up with the train in the station and Jeff telling me we had to move quickly. The others had gone. My bike was stuck under the bunks of course. I got it out, with assistance from Jeff and as we gathered our stuff the train darn well pulled out of Pamplona!!  The next stop was half an hour away, maybe 50 kilometres. We got off at the next station, a small town close to the Pyrenees. It was dead. I felt sorry for Jeff who may well have got off the train with his mates if it wasn't for my bike. We managed to get a Taxi, he reluctantly took my bike in the back and sped back down to Pamplona. Cost me 50 Euros. Ouch. I bade Jeff farewell as he went to search for his buddies. The bull run was at 8am and it was already 7.15am so I had to get a shift on. I wasn't prepared for the sights that greeted me next. The streets were full to bursting with people, the majority with a beer in hand and decidedly drunk. The stench of old mixed alcohol rose from the pavement and broken, crushed glass was everywhere. I couldn't even get close to viewing the bull run, so I sat on a bench and cursed. My time wasn't wasted as I had a puncture, no doubt from all the glass strewn across Pamplona' streets.     Although I thought the whole scene ugly, the festival was not without merit. Loads of brass bands, maybe 10-20 roamed the streets all day, with a procession of dancing, merry people following behind. There was a uniform of all white clothes embellished with a red necktie or scarf worn by the majority of people. So despite hordes of tourists, the locals still attended en masse. They all seemed very happy and just accepted the stench and carnage as part of the festivities. There were also concerts and firework displays and I estimate about 100,000 people were having a thoroughly good time.          Those guys on the bench were so far gone that when the Brazilian band gathered around and bashed their drums and blew their trumpets they didnt' even stir. Eventually a woman came with a bucket of water, but although they woke it required several men to carry them away.    The following day I had a great view, up on a balcony. There was carnage as someone slipped at the entrance to the bullring, which is the end of the run, and people crashed into each other. A bull came along and got stuck in. It was not a pretty sight as one poor chap got a horn right up his backside. Blood everywhere. The bull then tossed him for good measure. Seemed to me about 2000 actually took part in the actual run, chased by 6 bulls. Many ran so quickly at the start that they never even saw the bulls!  I was glad to have seen the spectacle but also keen to press on to catch a Pyreneean stage of the Tour de France. Back on the bike!"
322,"*** At this point I tried to insert a picture, but the darn PC keeps crashing so I will have to add them at a later date. ***  Why have I always managed to kill computers so easily? Bah. I took it to easily the first couple of days, I hadn't cycled at all in Pamplona and not done too much when I was travelling around with Jasmine and therefore found it quite hard going. I had to up the pace to get to the Tourmalet mountain but unfortunately my path was hindered by the Pyrenees! I struggled up my first true mountain, the Col de Pourtalet, a long drawn out affair which had me sweating profusely. Up and up, for miles and miles. The views were spectacular (not that I can show you the pictures to prove it yet!) and I found a beautiful campsite high in the mountains. Went to the campsite bar and chatted to two drunken ladies plus the barman. Proved quite entertaining as we all had language deficiences, so we conversed in a weird mixture of English, Spanish and French! One of the women took a shine to me, unsurprising considering the HUGE beer goggles she must have had on. Her English was worse than my Spanish which is an achievement. The barman interpreted.....""she wants sex with you"" he said. The lady staggered to the pool table and offered me a game. I took it easy but still couldn't avoid clearing up without her potting a ball. We could have played for an hour and she wouldn't have sunk one....  It reminded me of my last working days when I used to thrash my friend Adam Dawson all the time. Anyway, she decided pool was not her game so we returned to the bar. I hatched an escape plan but didn't require one as without the aid of the barman who had disappeared we couldn't really communicate. She became sullen and rather difficult so I said goodbye.  The next day as I continued climbing up the mountain I stopped at a Cafe for water. Guess who was serving? She had made a remarkable recovery and gave me a an embarrassed smile. Gave my legs fresh impetus...to get going as quickly as possible. Finally got to the top of the Pourtalet. It had been tough but my reward soon became apparent. A long, long descent over the other side. I can't describe it very well but it was my first ever mountain descent and it was exhillirating! Not just a five minute speed down but a twisty, turny, half hour of bliss. I reckon there is money to be made in taking people up to the top of these places in a car and then giving them a bicycle to fly down on. At the foot was a picnic area which showed a map of the mountain I had conquered plus a map of the adjoining one, the Col D'Aubisque. Again, words fail me, but it was the toughest physical test I have ever endured. Sixteen kilometres of stiff climb without a flat section anywhere to get a breather. The map at the picnic area had warned cyclists to 'PACE YOURSELF'. What a joke. There was only one pace I could go and the next one down from that was STOP. Due to the very slow pace I set further difficulties arose. Flies. Mosquitos. Not sure really what they were but they just would not leave me alone, attacking me with relish. When I actually stopped they swarmed all over me, biting lumps out of my exposed legs. I got to about the 10k point and quit for the day as a campsite came to my rescue. The following morning, the day of the Tour stage at the Col de Tourmalet I had the remaining 6K to ascend. It was just as hard as the previous day and took a good deal of the days 'cycling legs' out of me. I reached the foot of the Tourmalet at about 3PM, a town called Luz, which was filled with TDF addicts. The atmosphere was great, which is more than could be said for my legs. The stage finished about 5PM and I was on the wrong side of the mountain! I hadn't a prayer. No energy and 18K of mountain to climb before I could see Lance and the pack. So I settled in a nice bar and watched the TDF on TV, with the actual action taking place mere miles away! Was not pleased, to put it mildly.                 "
323,"I had taken a train across Southern France to get to the Alps in plenty of time for the stage and the riding was more enjoyable than usual as lots of fellow cyclists had similar ideas. Reaching the town at the foot of the mountain, Bourg D'Oisans, I embraced the Tour atmosphere once more. Thousands of people milling around, bicycles everywhere, mostly racers, and a carnival feel. The stage took place the next day and the road up would be shut off at 6AM so I had the task of climbing Alpe D'Huez that evening. I would not be alone as hundreds of cyclists were attempting the same. The only difference being I had 40Kg of panniers to lug up as well! There were a few tourers going up, but only a few. 13K of climb. No option but my lowest gear all the way. The difference to the Col D'Aubisque was company. That was a journey undertaken completely alone, whereas the Alpe D'Huez was already lined with thousands of people. I received huge cheers from so many as I made my way up that I almost felt compelled to continue without stopping. Almost. Stopped halfway for a Coca Cola. The second half seemed to be less steep to me, but with fatigue setting in, more difficult. I found a rhythm, which involved riding out of the saddle nearly all the way. It just seemed to be slightly easier to ride that way although I guess it makes more demands aerobically. The cheers continued all the way up, they were clapping and cheering me, it was fantastic. I reached the summit, exhausted, yet emotional. The effort had been great and I confess that tears were not too far away. I climbed off the bike and my legs wobbled. My whole body was shaking in fact. It had taken me around three hours to climb it. Lance Armstrong followed me up the next day........... in forty minutes.           "
324,             
325,"After the Alpe D'Huez I plotted my route across the Alps to Italy, destination Torino or Turin as we call it. I noticed that I would have to go over another Tour de France Col, the Lauteret. Coincindentally, this Col happens to be the  wallpaper on my PC at home, now donated to my parents. I attempted to capture a similar picture but couldn't get it right.    This climb was different to the rest, not a zig-zag up but more of a climb around the side of the mountain. It didn't feel as steep but that was of little compensation as my legs were well and truly cooked spaghetti. I met three Aussie cycle tourists (late twenties)on the way up, Aaron, Melissa and Karen. Two of them were both Triathletes and Psycologists! I had a chat with Aaron who was ahead of the ladies as we began to climb. They stopped for lunch and I pressed on, knowing they would catch me later....    I was in serious trouble, despite eating well that day, porridge in the morning and pasta for lunch. It got to the point where I was cycling no more than 100-200 metres and stopping. I could hardly push off on the bike. Sure enough Aaron came past two hours later. I asked for his assistance to get me up the mountain and just by chatting it helped. Aerobically I was fine, talking and cycling was easy, but the legs didn't want to know when I was on my own. Just goes to show how much of it is mental. With company I was able to carry on.      I camped with the Aussies for the evening and we went our seperate ways in the morning. One more Col to climb, I forget its name but it was a real git. I rode to a town called Oulx, where I had actually skiied a couple of years back. Caught the train to Turin, drawing blood yet again in attempting to lift my bike onto the train. Stayed overnight and spent the next day on three different trains all the way to Venice on the East coast of Northern Italy. Whether it was laziness or destroyed legs, I'm not sure, but I had no regrets about not cycling. Venice. Unique, beautiful. Very, very crowded. I'm having problems enjoying all this. After an hour, when you have marvelled at how beautiful and strange Venice is...then what. For me it is time to leave. I walked to St Marks' square. Thousands of tourists packed the place. What is there to see? I had no intention of queueing with the hordes to go into a cathedral. So I returned to my base. Basically I'm questioning my enjoyment and reasons for continuing my tour. I have the Olympics to look forward to but after that there are huge countries in front of me, Turkey, Iran then maybe Pakistan and India. Do I want to cycle them?  There is something back home which I've always wanted to do, but I have no skills in that area and would start from scratch. I'm also spending too much. Visiting big cities usually means expense but I'm not willing to forgoe the cities and just cycle the 'beautiful countryside' all the time. Anyway, I will tackle all this further down the line.... Here are some pictures of Venice         "
326,"It cost 80 Euros, fifty quid, for a place on deck for the thirty hour journey. There were three levels where I could lounge around and the ship was clean and comfortable.    I had failed to bring much cash with me and there were no ATM's on board but in hindsight I'm glad as all you could do was drink, eat and play slot machines. Despite a multinational presence I failed to have a single conversation with any of the passengers. Managed to grab about six hours sleep on a chair but still felt a bit laggy the day after. Patras is the third most populated city in Greece. The area near the port appears to the hub of everything and a very helpful lady in the Tourist booth directed me to a cheap, yet excellent place called Pension Nikos. For sixteen pounds I had my own room, a darn good shower and a comfy bed. No air conditioning though, but the evening was bearable without sheets on top. I wandered the bar/restaurant area and had a great meal followed by a few beers. Most of the Greeks speak good English and the barman was a nice chap who sent a few free Tequillas my way. The young Greek women are, on the whole, beautiful. In fact things seem to get better with every country I visit! In the morning I had my usual breakfast of two coffees, the sugar content varies according to alcohol intake the night before. It was a specialist coffee bar the like of which I have never seen. A weird and wonderful array of drinks, although they were not cheap. Chatted with Constantin, the barman/waiter?, a thirty year old who envied my travelling lifestyle. A coffee in this place was an hours wages for him! Pascucci I think the place was called...well worth a visit.
"
327,"All along the coast there were little beaches where you would find a beach taverna and a smattering of Greek sunbathers. The water was a lovely royal blue with the last thirty or forty metres next to the beach a clear turquiose.    The road was mostly flat so I could whizz along at a cracking pace before stopping and going for a swim!    Here is the view I have seen most of over the last three months!    There were a couple of campsites along the road and although it was tough to find and rather rundown, the view was pretty good. Elona Beach campsite.      Beach bar along the route.....   "
328,"This led me to a place called Pireaus, which seems to be the main port for Island hopping but is maybe 10k from the centre of Athens. I've cycled into Athens today but have been unable to locate what one might call 'the centre'. The place is dusty and has more than its share of litter. I managed to get a glimpse of the Acropolis and now wish to find a ticket booth so I can get some tickets for the Olympics. As I skipped most of Italy I've got here two weeks before the Olympics and I was worried about this a month ago! So....I'm going to grab some tickets to see Boxing, Cyling and Athletics and then go Island hopping around the Cyclades.    Have now got this website up to date with my travels. The problem with lagging ten days behind is that you forget things and if they are not written down, they are gone. Therefore, I use the photos from the camera to jog my memory but little incidents tend to get missed. Just today I observed some guy pretend to be on the phone. I thought he was a being a 'dirty ol' man' but he waited for the girl to leave her position at a newspaper stand and then helped himself to about 10 magazines! Bye."
329,"I went to the Port of Pireus near Athens one afternoon looking for a ferry to one of the nearer Cyclades islands. Choice was rather limited, Crete, Crete or Crete. There were three different destinations to the northern coast, Chania, Heraklion and another that escapes me. My map showed a campsite at Chania, the ferry would sail at 9pm and arrive at 5.30AM the next morning. So the cost of the ferry, a very reasonable twenty Euros, would also provide my sleeping accomodation. I could then go anti-clockwise around the islands... Rhodes (Rodos), Kos and back up to Athens. I failed to check how to get to Rhodes from Crete at the time and have now found out that I need to cycle across the other side of the north coast to the port of Agios Nikolaus. Chania or Hania as the Cretans call it used to be the islands capital until 1972. That honour has now passed to Heraklion for reasons unknown to me. Plenty going on there and a very picturesque harbour. Crete is hot, too darn hot. It is also rather barren and mountainous, certainly not ideal cycling conditions. I have split my journey into 50 mile segments, Chania to Rethymol, Rethymol to Heraklion and Heraklion to Agios Nikolaus (with a possible stopoff in Malia....). Very few flat sections, all up and down and a searing heat has made it less than pleasurable. Some of the car driving beggars belief. Very impatient, always tooting and they park anywhere. The most common vehicle on the road is the Toyota Hilux truck, usually loaded up with water melons or plastic chairs. Must not forget the crazy scooters either! Darting in and out of traffic, red lights slow them but don't stop them. A quick glance left and right and they just sail through... I'm currently in the capital, Heraklion, delaying cycling as my legs feel rough after yesterdays exertions. No pictures...not much to show really. I tried to capture four mountain goats climbing a very steep bank, but they were so nimble that disappeared over the horizon as I took the picture. What else has happened...... an old woman running the beach campsite I stayed at last week commented on how soft my hands were, ""you do very little work in your life"". Well I've tried..... I've hit a pothole coming down a mountain in Crete at about 40mph. Back wheel did a wiggle but I stayed upright. Would have been messy. I've also lost my temper with a couple of drivers who've come past me and then immediately applied their brakes to turn into a road forcing me to take evasive action. Down to my last book. When I flew home for a couple of days I grabbed a bunch of novels (I went through a buying phase a few years back but stopped reading)but the last couple of months have rekindled my interest. Haven't seen many opportunities to purchase more and I can't read any old trash. Not one duffer amongst the following ; The Plague -Albert CamusAngela's Ashes -Frank McCourtHeart of the Matter -Graeme GreeneThe curious incident of the dog in the night-time -Mark HaddonInvisible Man -Ralph EllisonMemoirs of a Geisha -Arthur GoldenLove in the time of Cholera -Gabriel Garcia Marquez Occasionally a book may make me smile but I couldn't supress laughing out loud at an incident in the Cholera book. This passage is for my benefit, something to remember when I look back at the journal. It relates to a very clever and well trained parrot who had lived on a ship for a number of years. ""For many years they clipped his wing feathers and let him wander wherever he chose to walk with his hulking old horseman's gait. But one day he began to do acrobatic tricks on the beams in the kitchen and fell into the pot of stew with a sailor's shout of 'every man for himself'. Bye."
330,"Weightwatchers update : After six weeks of the tour I returned home for a few days and reported that I had lost nineteen pounds in weight. Roughly eight weeks have passed and I can tell you that I have lost another ten. So from 13 stone 4 to a much fitter 11 stone 3 (186 to 157pounds). I will continue to cycle, sans panniers, and have booked myself into the local gym.  Thanks for the all the guestbook comments and emails along the way.  Bye."
331,"i'll be uploading photos when i get a chance, which isn't going to be often. its the 30th of september and i already have more than 250. i wont be putting all of them up here, but a decent amount. text as well will come when i get the chance. my mom now has the password, so she will update with my location and distance every few days. after las vegas and moab, updates should occur more often, as i will have time to stop at libraries and internet cafe's.... till then. -sean"
332,"budget for the trip? probably about $500. i'll be freecamping every night that i dont stay with a friend, eating rice and beans, and whatever is the cheapest fresh fruit and vegetables i can find, and foraging(in the woods, no dumpster -eeewwww- diving here). im an artist, and i can carve, so if it gets tight, i'll try and sell some of my carvings or artwork along the way. last resort would be to use one of my three extremely marketable skills for a traveller. i've got quite a bit of experience as a bike messenger, a bike mechanic, and in construction. probably the three best possible trades to know if you plan on getting temporary work around the country... more, much, much more to come."
333,"tomorrow i weld my frame. its cracked halfway down the seat tube from a rather dumb-ass move i pulled. i had a thomson post stuck in the frame. really stuck. no amount of twisting was getting this thing out. so i followed the advice on sheldon browns site. it's good advice. it would have worked great. its just that i got impatient. i cut the seatpost off about two inches above the seat collar, like i was supposed to. i took a hacksaw blade and cut the seat tube from the inside, like i was supposed to. i convinced myself that i had cut all the way through. i hadn't. i was tapping a flathead screwdriver down in between the post and the frame to pry the post in so i could just roll it up and pull it out. i got a little overzealous and put the screwdriver right through the frame.  after i got over feeling like an ass, i evaluated the problem and figured out a way to fix it without a welder that i dont have. i drilled holes at the end of all the cracks so that they wouldn't spread. i sawed the derailluer off of a front derailluer, so that all that was left was the clamp. with the new seatpost at the right height, the clamp was holding the bottom of the seatpost, and the seat collar the top. this worked great. then i raised my seat. (a month or so later) the bike lasted to nyc and back, to philly and back. mountain biking all over the area. it lasted to new hampshire and back no problem. it finally started clicking and swaying a couple of weeks ago, after i rode it to the bike shop(1,100 ft road climb, dried up riverbed descent) a bunch of times. i've welded bike frames before. even made one. im certified and everything. so it wont be a problem. i just have to bring it down to my friend scotts body shop in dover, so i can use his welder. so i may not be updating on the first night, which was my intention. i may have to skip philly and head straight to state college, likely a two day ride before i stay at a friends house... i've been to philly more than enough times, and ill see nick and chuck on the way back."

337,"2: follow my first piece of advice. 3: when packing, bundle items you use at the same time. try and keep all sleeping gear together. instead of packing your sleeping clothes with your other clothes, stuff them into whatever bag your sleeping bag is in.  4: bring along a few extra zip lock bags, AND a few extra of those plastic shopping bags. i use the platic shopping bags on my seat when it rains, for seperating soiled, smelly clothes from my clean clothes, and seperating gear in my bags. they are very, very handy. 5: don't ride through the middle of illinois. it sucks. no shoulders. lots of dogs. maybe it was just the fact that i had been riding for 36 hours straight, and was tired and irritable, but i did not enjoy my time in illinois.  6: dont ride through east st louis.  7: if in need of a place to camp, ask at the local fire department if they know of a town park or church where you could set up a tent. they'll probably offer you a spot outside one of the fire stations. 8: be careful where you camp. i woke up one morning after camping in a farmers field, to find everything i owned covered in these sticky little seedpods. im sure i'll still be removing them in mexico. 9: when you find flats, DO NOT expect them to stay that way. always expect a hill. 10: if a skunk runs out in front of you, pick your legs up!!! better for it to spray your bike and bags than you and your riding clothes. i know this now from experience. 11: if you're trying to put in big mileage, keep your diet simple. mine consists mostly of raw fruits, honey, peanut butter, and cold, raw oatmeal. the easiest food to digest is the best because your body can devote more of its energy to riding, and less to digestion. and after a particularly hard day, drink some kind of drink mix energy drink. it WILL help you recover quicker. 12: look to make sure there is tp in the porta john BEFORE you sit down. i learned this on my last trip. 13: if you're squeamish, resist the overwhelming urge to look down the hole of portajohns and pit toilets before you sit down. im not squeamish at all, but i have walked away from a few after making that mistake. 14: dont be lazy about starting your trip, but once on the road, why not? it is a vacation right? 15: dont pay for camping. c'mon now. its pointless. you can camp for free almost anywhere, and showers are available at most town pools or gyms. or you can just take a gallon jug, fill it with water, and find a secluded spot to sponge off. 16. carefull about products made of wax in your bags. i had a '36 hour emergency candle'(which did serve to keep me warm a couple of nights) in one of my panniers and it melted in the dessert sun. eventually it completely melted/evaporated off, but it made a huge mess while it was there. 17. it's very possible to extend your time on the road significantly if you imagine that you have nothing to return to, and only the future on the road to look forward too(and that is good). stop for a week in a town if you can find work with a road or construction crew(dont tell them you are only in town for a week). or any other type of work. 18. don't let a lack of money prevent you from riding across the country. people have done it on all sorts of bike, even $50 unicycles. people have done it with all thier gear in a backpack. people have made thier own racks and panniers for very little money. people have done it on less than $5 a day in the us, much less(and done it comfortably at that). homeless people with *NO* money have done it. its just a matter of adjusting your standards. remember that the tougher your situation on the road, the more likely it is for you to find adventure.
"
338,"turns out i have alot more family scattered across north america than i originally thought. i'll be visiting my aunt Anne(who is also my godmother)and cousin Shiela in st louis, my cousin TJ in iola kansas, and possibly a few others, we'll have to see where the road takes me and when. it was kind of amusing to find out that those mentioned above would be no more than 15 miles off my intended route at the get go.  something doesn't seem right about the fact that im typing that 'im off' while im sitting here at the keyboard and haven't pedalled down the driveway yet. the more i type, the less i ride. that said, you'll have an update tomorrow night or friday from state college, pa.   "
339,"i stopped into my moms school to say one last goodbey and to have her class(1st grade) see me off. they're tracking my progress across the country to help them learn geography.  once on the familiar paulinskill trail, i settled into the 'i'm out there' mode. as i worked my way down the trail i absorbed the familiar sights and smells. i checked out the abandoned water tower that i had always wanted to check out. the horses bearing riders were a little edgy. ""they can feel the storm comin"" said one of the riders. it's ALWAYS best to dismoutn your bike, walk and speak out loud when approaching a horse bearing a rider. even when you're on the road, especially when you're on the trail. they(the horses) don't know what you are. to them, because they dont know the mechanics of a wheel, you appear to be floating towards them. you are almost silent. with panniers front and rear, you appear even larger. disregarding the simple rule of dismount, walk and talk is an easy way to cause harm to the rider, the horse and yourself.  i arrived at columbia lake just in time to capture the sunset relfected in the pond below. i waited out of sight till it was dark, and set up my tent where i thought it wouldn't be spotted. it didn't work. i got headlights and a horn, which i watched but didn't react to. the wco, or land manager, or whoever it was drove off. i felt lucky. i fell asleep to the sound of 18 wheelers jake-braking down the hill on 80 just as it enters the delware water gap.  at sometime during the night i was startled by headlights. seemingly right upon my tent. i could make out what sounded like someone clapping thier hands. like you would imagine a rancher doing behind a horse to get it to move where he wants it to. i was getting kinda nervous as it got closer. all of a sudden, i heard ""HEY!""and jumped, sat up, only to find myself all alone in complete darkness. i wondered if i had dreamt the lights and clapping, or if i had simply fallen back asleep only to wake a short while later after my rouser had given up and left me to my slumber.  i laid awake for a while, poking my head out of the tent every now and then to make sure. i finally drifted off to sleep again, only occasionally awoken by the sound of the trucks. each time i couldn't help but wonder how far they were going, what they were going to see, and how long it was going to take them. out there, driving through the night, delivering the items that we all use every day. the long haul truckers see so much, or do they?       "
340,"     crossing the appalachian trail was exciting for me. i've always been fascinated by it and would love to hike it someday.  as the day wore on the clouds rolled in and i passed through alot of the typical pennsylvania mining towns. row houses, poverty, an overwhelming degree of acceptance among the people of the notion that they are there, and that is where they belong and will stay. you see alot of the towns, which are built around the coal mines, with names like shamokin, and mount carmel, eckley and white haven, and then you get to the town named coal. how oppressive of a word to name a town in a coal mining region. not to give them a name that even allows some deviation of thought from the from the controlling factor of these peoples daily lives. it's like they live in a panopticon with coal mining at the center, watching thier every move, monitoring thier every thought, ensuring through psychology that they are not going anywhere.  with hurricane/tropical storm isabel coming in, people where getting nervous. it wore off on me. i had been saying all along that if it followed its projected path, that the mountains would kill it. i was thinking to myself all day that if i could find a pine tree farm with some 6-12 ft young pines, i could camp safely in amongst the low, strong trees. not knowing what a forty mile an hour wind gust was like though, and gathering apprehension from the demeanor of the people in the towns i passed through, i decided to set out to find a hotel for the night.  i kept getting further along, hoping to just add up the mileage before giving in, till i reached mt carmel. i stopped at the local fire company to ask about accomodations. i was buzzed in, and walked up stairs to find the volunteers and a few locals sitting around a fully stocked bar. i found that amusing but kept my amusement to myself. i ended up paying $51 at a motel about four blocks away. shame, shame, i know your name....   "
341,"the scenery heading north from mount acrmel was gorgeous though.      i crossed the susquehanna three times where it branches off, or rather feeds in just north of sunbury.      woodward, an 'extreme' sports and gymnastics camp was having a bmx race, but i didn't have time to stop. i ate a hot sub(peppers, onion, pizza sauce) at the last familiar eatery i will see for a long time. from there it was a charge for state college and erics shop. i finally reached 322, i turned onto it with a renewed energy and motored. i called a couple of times because i couldn't locate some of the exits on the map. finally got a flat, figured out that i was on the bypass, not the 'bus', figured out how to get there, and marched off to where i was supposed to be, two miles or so away. i fixed the flat along the way, but didn't realize till arriving at the shop that it was caused by the slash in the tire made by the malalligned brae pad. after meeting everyone at the shop, and having a beer, we packed my bike into erics truck and headed for his house. there i met pepper, his cocker spaniel mix. a shower two nights in a row. yeah, im roughing it alright....

342,"i headed for a bike path on the pa south route that would turn out to be impassable due to nearly 100 downed trees. so i marched up and over the mountain i was trying to avoid to get back on my original route. i rode through small towns and woods. when i got on 655, it was dead flat, then mildly hilly. i thought for the first little while that i was further along than i really was. when i finally realized how far i still had to go for the day i stepped on it.     it was getting dark when i passed north hess rd for the first time. i thought to myself that it was the correct road, because i recognized it, but kept pushing on.     at the top of the next small roller, with the lights from the school on north hess still visible in the background, i found a secluded little spot is tall grass behind some 6-8 foot tall, thick bushes. i set up my tent and went to sleep stargazing. through the night, i heard the occasional car pass, the birds in the bushes, and horses somewhere nearby. i also hear the scurrying of mice in the grass, and worried about my foodbags and open backpack, sitting right outside the tent. i didn't bother getting out and shutting them though..."
343,"i got up and out of the tent around 6:30. the birds were still making all sorts of interesting noises, there were no field mice in my foodbags, i couldn't see the horses anywhere, and those bushes turned out to be cranberry bushes. i ate a couple. they were as bitter and tart as i expected them to be.    i packed up pretty quickly and headed towards hustontown. the road was a little demoralizingly hilly, which i think has more to do with my mental and physical state then the actual grades and frequency of the hills. why am i doing this on a single speed again? i passed north hess for the second time and found myself now on the pa east/west 's' route. headed east of course. i crossed over the currently operational turnpike and took the next road. the name was familiar and it went in the right direction. it was a dead end. on the way back out, some people were up and enjoying coffee on thier porch. (reffering to me)""now thats a working man's job."", one said to his neighbor. i asked for driections to little egypt road. he sent me on back the way i came to davis lane. i stopped on the way there to ask a woman out with her dogs if his directions were adequate. the dogs, of course, went apeshit. a cyclist is like a giant squirrel to a dog. i stepped off the bike and put my hand out to the dogs, palm down. they all came and sniffed it, saw that i was not, in fact, a giant squirrel and went back to jumping around like idiots and chasing each others tails. one chocolate colored one wasn't too sure though, so he kept his distance, but kept barking in my general direction. the lady said i should take north hess, but i took davis lane anyway, simply because i came to it first. it was pretty, but rather hilly. it went to little egypt like it was supposed to. i got to another road i recognized and decided to take advantage of that wretched cell phone of mine. i called the mom and got her to direct me to where i wasnted to go. pump station road. that was the one i couldn't think of. so i got going, got to the abandoned pa turnpike, now a bike/walking path, and was loving it. there i was, in the middle of the woods, riding in the fast lane, slow lane, wrong lane of an abandi\oned super highway.             once off the trail and on route thirty, it took alot of discipline to stay out of the gazillion truck stop eateries. i also spotted some $20-30 a night motels. where the hell where they in mount carmel? you dont get a heated pool or continental brakfast, but for a lone traveller looking for a bed, its a good deal. 30 was uneventful. the rubber sleeve on the bracket that holds my rear rack to my seatstay had mysteriously disappeared, and i rode right past two seperate leather work gloves on the side of the road that would have been perfect to fix it. dont know why, just did. i took a rest at the everett town gazebo. it was about 1:30.  onward to route 31, come down through mann's choice. thats the name of the town. some light, rolling hills, then a wall. a monster of a climb. welcome to the appalachian mountains. reminded me of some of thr hills i had pushed up in vermont last month. the entire town of west end is on the side of this hill. i found the piece of leather i needed and packed it. when i got near the top, there was a sign welcoming me to the laurel highlands. more, steeper rolling hills, and then another 'calf killer'. from the top of that hill, it was downhill for miles. 14% at some points, eyes watering, flying, leaning the bike so far in the turns that the straps from the panniers are dragging the ground. it was a good ending to the day. decided to sleep out under the stars, just me, my blanket and sleeping pad. it was great."
344,"i ran into paul and jim, who were on a multi-day ride in the area(on thier own). they shared thier cookies, carrots and stories with me. paul had ridden across the country back in the 80's. i was under the impression that this trail, like the c&o(the part from dc to this trail), had free trailside camping every five miles or so. i only saw two spots which could have passed for such. when i finally rode into ohiopyle, i stopped in at the bike/canoe/kayak rental place, picked up a bunch of postcards and a few brochures. found out not only  that falling water, the frank loydd wright house, which i wanted to see, is closed on mondays; but that tours are $12 and you have to pay $20 if you want to take pictures. then, once home, you can't do anything with the pictures, not even post them on a website like this. as the english say it, BARSTODS!!! the real rai finally started. i decided to head up and check out the state park campground. it was a long, steep, demoralizing push to the top. the kind of push that no amount of gears could get you up fully loaded like i am. well, like the bike is. i wished at that point i was fully loaded. would have made the hill a little less frustrating. i've begun to tell myself that whatever hill im on never ends. this way all those false summits aren't as heart breaking. reaching the top of kentuck rd, i turned onto campground road and climbed some more. i can accept the fact that the state park campgrounds are on the tops of hills. especially when i would have had to scale that wall anyway to get out of the ohiopyle valley. when i reached the summit however, i found no campground, just a long steep downhill to mirror the one i had just pushed up. turns out the campground is up one side and down the other. no way in hell i was going to wake up to pushing up that damned hill again... to spite them, i freecamped about thirty feet from the road, right across from the entrance, behind a cranberry bush. at the time i chose my spot, it could not have been later then 4:30. 3 hrs till dark. so i removed my bright yellow bag and bright blue gore tex jacket and stashed them under the bush. i put on my matte green poncho and sat there, completely still, in the only spot invisible to both roads. i thought about real army special forces, and how they will sit in weather like this, even sleep, sitting up in nothing more than the clothes they're wearing and a poncho. i though about extreme ultralight backpackers who do the same. i though about how frikken cold i was getting. so i set up my tent, threw some dry clothes, my sleeping pad, blanket, liner, fleece and some snacks in there and jumped in.  birds in cranberry bushes make strange noises... once it got dark, the action began. one nearby dog barked,(at me?), ALL NIGHT LONG. NON STOP. it was an amazing feat of endurance. i truly expected it to keel over and die from exhaustion as the night drew on. then there was the deer(elk?) near my tent, and the strange sound of the bark of the dog that noticed it. my hearing became impeccable. with my ear close to the ground, i heard all. at one point, i poked my head out of the tent to see if i could better tell where exactly the barking dog was. i looked to the south, and saw this eerie light. it could have been two lights, as it seemed my eyes were playing tricks on me. it was oddly shaped, not like a light seen through a window or a porch light. it was glowing this extremely hot amber color, but didn't seem to be lighting up any of what surrounded it. it appeared to be at the edge of the next field, where there were no houses. it also seemed like the barking dog was in that general direction. what the hell was this light? it almost hurt my eyes to look at it, but i could barely bring my self to stop. the light, or the concept of it, and questions it aroused, had a tight grip on me for nearly an hour.  i finally resolved to crawl back into my tent and try to sleep. occasionally, it would sound like the dog, who by this time i had named 'blood throat', for obvious reasons, was getting closer, then further away, and over again. perhaps it was just me fading in and out of sleep to the feroscious metronome of his voice. at some point, my body relented and i fell asleep. i was only occasionally woken by the sound of rain falling heavilly on my tent, the sound of my growling stomach(which i several times mistook for a bear), or by my foot slipping off of my sleeping pad into the puddle of water accumulating at one end of my tent.   "
345,"""i honestly wasn't expecting today to be hilly, but it has been so far and im at a rest stop where there is a big flashing sign saying ""Truck Warning: Dangerous Mountain Ahead"". i don't like that sign."" -excerpt from my journal... it was just one hill. the last big one of the appalachians. chestnut ridge. as soon as i realized i was out of the big hills, my legs suddenly felt lighter and stronger. the bike didn't feel as heavy. i rolled into uniontown and stopped at the laundromat on 21. good and cheap, but no bathroom. after drying out my tent and heading out, 21 was like a dream. a few small rollers, but mostly flat. untill the last ten miles that is. pennsylvania has its last hoorah at that point with some decent sized walkers. i decided to check out Ryerson state park(refference: earlier prediction) for the night. in order to camp. in order to camp, which is at the top of the hill, you have to register with the park office, at the bottom of the hill. when i stopped at the office, it was closed, being 6pm. so i hung out, made some phone calls and marched off up the hill. it was kind of nice having a perfectly flat, recently mowed campsite with picnic table at my disposal. maybe, just maybe, i'll get up and out of here early enough to miss the rangers and not have to pay...."
346,"i decided to air it out a little, and as i was doing so the caretaker drove around. i smiled and waved and he waved back. i went up to the bathroom to brush my teeth and he was up there changing the garbage. he mentioned the free showers they had down by the now closed pool i passed on the way in(which means its on the way out. he didn't mention anything about seeing my camping permit or paying for camping. i think he knew too. if you're reading this right now, thank you. so i got a good nights sleep, a ride up a pesky hill, toilets and a shower in an immaculate locker room. after my shower, i lounged in the sunshine while my tent dried, and wrote out my postcards. finally got on the road around ten am. riding through west virginia on route 250n was just plain pretty. no other word for it. gorgeous winding road along the ridges. courteous drivers, friendly people. till i got to the armpit town of moundsville on the ohio river. dirty place, but the food was cheap. i was only in wv for about 20 miles. i knew southern ohio had some hills, but i wasn't expecting the thier size. it was no sweat, i mean, they weren't the big steeps of pa, but they weren't necessarily easy. i decided to try and pull the first of what i was sure would be several all nighters that night. ""we'll see how long that lasts when it starts getting dark and i start spotting 'perfect' camp spots... it's 6:30 now. i've got at least 4 hrs till i hit the flatter parts of the state."" -journal excerpt ""i dont know if words can describe the amount of stars they have out here. it's absolutely breathtaking. i'm moving at an average of about 7-8 mph because im spending so much time standing there looking up. growing up in new jersey, with the ambient light from all the nearby cities, the short steep hilliness, and any number of other factors, i really didn't know that night was this beautiful. i tried taking a photo of the stars, but i have a max(slowest) 8 second shutter speed, so i couldn't quite capture it. it's kind of like in a george lucas film from the 80's. take your pick, e.t., any one of the first three star wars movies he made. i really don't know what else to say.  ""im riding through reclaimed mining land. tall pines, low scrub, open fields. it adds to it all. stunning."" -journal excerpt @11:30 pm"
347,"so, back to the memorial, they have the scoop from ""big muskie"", the largest drag line crane ever built. it weighed 27 million pounds. yeah, 27 million. absolutely enormous. makes the big crane up in eckley pa look tiny.  ""i'm not sleepy. i think my next trip after this one is going to be walking. be it the at(appalachian trail) or across the country. i want to walk for a long time. this means a shitty job for a few months when i get back, followed by knee surgery, followed by recovery. yeah. i'll pack light, look around more, see more. be alot more mobile and alot more low key when i need to be. i've been thinking about it alot lately. mostly while pushing my bike up hills..."" -journal excerpt @1:30 am i took a power nap. it seemed to have worked. it went a little longer than i would have liked, as i got up around 3:30 and wrote some more in my jounal. i slept under the picnic table at one of the pavillions there. just laid out my sleeping pad, put on my fleece, and wrapped myself in my blanket. it was comfy. i still had heart burn though, caused by my new addiction, the 25 cent little debbie 'nuttie bars' that they have in every convenience store in north america. its a good deal for a snack food, but A: they give me heart burn, and B: they are almost definitely not vegan. so off i headed, deciding that i WOULD make it to indiana that day. i got going, go to the bottom of the hill i was on, and noticed a discrepancy between the feel of my front and rear tires when i went over bumps. i gave it the benefit of the doubt that it was just the hot day/cold night that leeched the air out, even though the front was fine. i pumped it up to appropriate pressure and rode on. within a few miles though, it was soft again, so i set about changing it. the end of the tire liner did it. i folded a couple of pieces of duct tape around the end. hope it works.   at 1:30 pm. charging my lights at junction city park, junction city, ohio. while food shopping in new lexington, which, by the way, is famous for being the ""near birthplace"" of some guy who was the liberator of bulgaria, this thought would not leave my head: ""GET ME THE HELL OUT OF HERE!!!"". i decided to aim for the mounds state recreation area north of brookville indiana. i thought i liked backwards hicks and white trash, but they're a whole different breed over here. then there was the orange sludge-mud melting off of the hills in some parts. i dont know what it was, probably just mud with a high iron content in it, but it was nasty.  i realized later in the day that it was just that stretch of route 37 from route 78 to junction city.  ""i keep telling myself that once my current stash of food runs out(or low enought to resupply), that i will buy one of those hand operated can openers, but then i never do. im smart like that."" -journal excerpt once i reached lancaster, ohio became nice again. i stopped for a rest at the town park and chatted with two older gentlemen who take care of the park. they were excited about my trip and hooked me up with 4 ice cold bottles of water. just outside lancaster, it becomes flat, really flat. i was making really good time, cruising. could have made indiana i think, but 22 is a long straight road. most people gave me a ton of room, but i had one too many cars 'buzz' me. i guess a crazy guy on a bike is the only thing to look at out there, and some people just dont know how to take advantage of the theory of target fixation. i think it was mostly older people who came too close, based on the type of car. ifinally had one come litterally within millimeters of me. that was it. i found an abandoned driveway. no sign of a house, but there was a big paved area at the end, behind some trees and shrubs.  i guess i was visible from the road, because around 12:45 am, a sherrifs deputy cruised in to see what i was doing there. after explaining the situation, he assured me that i should be safe there and wished me a good trip. really cool."
348,"to put it plainly, the rest of the day i felt like crap. inched up the hills, rolled down them, managed to get across the flats. about those hills, yeah, i found them. i really thought i was in the clear all the way to the rockies for some reason when i hit that mid-ohio pancake. it all started as soon as i got onto lebanon rd, and it just got hillier. once in indiana, i got my first ""GET THE FUCK OFF THE ROAD!!!"". i knew it would happen eventually, but get this, it was from a ten y/o kid. he was leaning out the back window of the cab of a pick up truck. no doubt with his parents on either side laughing. i smiled and waved at him and got the middle finger in return. add that to the walking-grade hills and the now miserable weather, and i though, yeah, indiana, glad to be here....when i got to brookville, the first big town, they had been tipped off to my arrival and were having a parade to celebrate. actually it was thier homecoming parade, headed right up the street i needed to ride up. so i sat back and watched the spectacle. it was like no other parade ive ever seen. basically, all the townsfolk and kids stood on the side of the road while the football teams, fire company, homecoming queen, and anyone else who was participating constantly threw candy at them. pounds upon pounds of it. it littered the streets. the kids were filling up shopping bags, pillow cases and pockets with it. it was complete absurdity. talked to a few interested people as i followed the parade out. one family were cyclists. they told me of another x continenter who was supposed to pass through town either that night or the friday before. they also sent me on a much less hilly route. thank you very, very sincerely.i finally spotted a reasonably flat area and trdged up through the weeds and wildflowers to reach it. once in there though, i found myself covered with these sticky little, triangular brown seedpods. oh well, i thought, im already in it. i set up tent and got inside. i would later find out that they are reffered to, coloquially, as 'bugger ticks'. when i got to brookville, the first big town, they had been tipped off to my arrival and were having a parade to celebrate. actually it was thier homecoming parade, headed right up the street i needed to ride up. so i sat back and watched the spectacle. it was like no other parade ive ever seen. basically, all the townsfolk and kids stood on the side of the road while the football teams, fire company, homecoming queen, and anyone else who was participating constantly threw candy at them. pounds upon pounds of it. it littered the streets. the kids were filling up shopping bags, pillow cases and pockets with it. it was complete absurdity.  talked to a few interested people as i followed the parade out. one family were cyclists. they told me of another x continenter who was supposed to pass through town either that night or the friday before. they also sent me on a much less hilly route. thank you very, very sincerely. i finally spotted a reasonably flat area and trdged up through the weeds and wildflowers to reach it. once in there though, i found myself covered with these sticky little, triangular brown seedpods. oh well, i thought, im already in it. i set up tent and got inside. i would later find out that they are reffered to, coloquially, as 'bugger ticks'."
349,"spent the better part of five hours drying out my gear and stripping it of the pesky little seedpods. im sure of the fact that i'll still be pulling them off of occasional gear in mexico. i decided to aim for 3 days to saint louis. wished it were less, but it'll have to do. headwind was cruel. i made it to shelbyville where i stopped in at the fire company to ask about setting up a tent at a local park or church. before long, i was setting up camp behind thier water tower station, which reminded me of the darkwing duck lair. i had access to thier bathroom, water fountain and outlets. sweet.       "
350,"""it's late now and i intend to ride all night, or at least till vandalia illinois. if i arrive there pre-dawn, i'll take a nap before the final 75 miles to st louis. so i figure, st louis by 2 then."" -journal excerpt       "
351,"so i made it to vandalia about 1:30 pm. i was beat. i found a box of pre packaged cheese danishes sitting in the sun on the side of the road. apparently fallen off of a truck. vegan be damned, i promptly devoured all of them. freegan i guess. that's just too good of a find for a cheaply travelling cyclist to pass up. i decided to try my hand at hitching a ride to st louis with a trucker. i was right at the interstate. it felt weird and wrong. i didn't hitch in the traditional sense. i couldn't bring myself to actually stick my thumb out, but i asked a few drivers if they were headed to st louis and if they would take me. they either weren't heading that way, or wouldn't take me for reasons of company policy or whatever. it was for the better. even though it turned out to be more like 80-90 miles to st louis from vandalia. i charged into the wind. i pretended i was eating the wind, gulping it up in big mouthfuls as i pedalled along. it seemed to work. the mental games we play with ourselves to get by... reached my first rest stop and called my little sister norah. it was the first time i had gotten to talk to her since i had left, which was nice. i lingered longer than i should have before setting off again. called my aunt to let her know i would be rather later than i had planned. i took off from the rest stop feeling great. almost sprinting the next 20 miles. it felt good, except when i moved on the seat a little. the pad in my shorts, while making the ride a little more comfortable, seems to be wearing a hole in my ass. my butt and knees are hating me from riding so much. especially since i didn't cover my knees at all while riding last night. the cold air did them no good. i started getting excited when i got within 15-20 miles of saint louis, on historic route 66(now a different number). i began to have those hallucinations you get when you've been awake for a really long time. the squigly stripes of tar on the road began to up and slither away in front of me, i could swear i saw a grain silo up and walk away. i also kept getting those vision shifts, where the scene you're looking at all of a sudden freezes, then shifts. as if the image in front of you pauses, and upon restarting has to catch up with your eyes, which have now moved to a different focal point... coming down through edwardsville, i cursed illinois for their lack of shoulders, but kept catching glimpses of the bright lights so common of cities everywhere, and that kept my spirits high. this would be the first big city on my trip. vistalight batteries ran out, so i searched briefly and unsuccessfully for the trek light i had stashed somewhere back in pa. took off down the hills of western illinois with maglight in hand. more glimpses of the lights, over and over. from the hilltops and clearings. nearing granite city, saw lots of mailboxes with flames painted on them. then real flames, and smoke. i saw it up the road i needed to travel, but people were just casually driving by as if it were nothing... it really looked like a house was on fire. so i rode up to investigate, only to realize it was the burn-off from the steel plant. made for some incredible pictures though....  i rode on towards the bridge i intended to take across the mississippi...  i apparently mapped out the 'scenic' route into saint louis. mckinley bridge, my intended crossing, was closed. the detour sent me south through an even more scenic route. by scenic i mean broken glass and abandoned buildings. the shitty parts. welcome to east saint louis, illinois... i couldn't have cared less, i mean,  i've lived in worse areas of north philly. besides, the way i smelled and looked at that point, no one was gonna mug me.  made it to the detour bridge, the martin luther king jr. turns out a bunch of highways and interstates merge right there and i found myself spat out into the middle of it all. i rode up the shoulder to where the bridge started, but there was no pedestrial walkway or bikelane. with the hour and speed of traffic there was no way i was gonna try and ride across it. i called my aunt a few times, but it was difficult to explain exactly where i was, as i didn't know, and difficult for her to figure out how to get across, having never ridden a bike to east saint louis. not many reasonable people have i would imagine... finally ended up calling the east st louis police and having the very friendly and helpful dispatcher guide my to the lovely eads bridge, which had an excelent walkway and afforded me excellent views of the the arch and skyline, and the riverboat 'casino queen', all lit up at night... turns out those lights i had seen earlier were the steel mill, not the city. i continued on through the clean, nice, and empty streets of saint louis to my aunts place, arriving around 1 am.  triple century with some extra mileage left over since yesterday morning on a loaded down single speed... impressed myself a little bit.  i was asleep before my head hit the pillow.               "
352,      
353,
354,"getting late, i couldn't find stores to get coffee. not that i need it. i just wanted something warm and stimulating to keep me up. i wanted another big mileage run. its cold out there. eventually stopped on a small bridge on the trail and took a nap. woke up pretty cold and resolved to set up the tent and spend the rest of the night bundled up. just before climbing into the tent i spotted a large dog-sized animal just at the end of the bridge. couldn't identify it, but it wasn't bothered by my presence at all as it slowly tromped down to the creek for a drink.  i crawled into my tent, got as warm as i could and just faded out...         "
355,"decided to ride on, and it was a gooooood decision. just east of rocheport, i found an amazingly gorgeous spot to set up my tent for the night and couldn't pass it up. it was at one of the more secluded benches along the missouri river. with the trail being the only thing separating me from the 100 ft white bluffs behind me, a small(10-15 ft) path separating me from the trail, and a manmade rock outcropping right above the river, complete with bench, flagstone and finely crushed gravel behind it, i set up the tent. the only way it could have been better would have been closer proximity to a portajohn... i imagined myself grady, of the grady, lewis and clark expedition.       "
356,"woke up nicely this morning, warm, with the sun rising over the big muddy. got up, peed, and quickly took the tent down and packed it up so it wouldn't be blatantly obvious to passers by that i had camped there. legs felt great. i rode without problem or incident, although at a lesser pace then i would have liked to the end of the trail. OH, there was one incident. flat tire. the duct tape on my tire liner didn't work. i patched the tube and reinstalled it in the same place in the hopes that the thick patch would do the job the duct tape couldn't. yeah, thats right, i found a job that duct tape couldn't do. amazing i know.... along the trail i saw all kinds of wildlife. a fox tramped across the trail, i saw a few red tailed hawks, brown, black, grass, garter and a few other types of snakes, probably countless types of endangered prairie birds that i wouldn't be able to identify, and lots of riders headed in the other direction(of course). its not that im that fast and no one going my way could catch me or anything like that, it's just that as luck would have it, the least hilly way through the ozarks is almost entirely uphill. riding from st charles, i went against the current of the river, then climbed up to the osage plains among the ozarks on the way to clinton.  at clinton, realizing the time, i called tj and asked if he would be down with meeting halfway in his truck. we agreed to meet near the kansas/missouri border around 10-11. as has been proving to be the case, it was further than i thought it was. i tried calling several times to warn him i would be late or just decided to camp for the night, but by the time i got reception, he had already left. i left messages, but he had no way of checking them. i got to butler at 11:00. i realized i still had something like 18 miles left just to the border. i didn't know what to do. what if he had already left? what if he hadn't? what if i rode on, and he was gone, and i couldn't find another camp spot? what if i didn't ride on and he sat there for hours, or called the police to go looking for me because he wouldn't know where i was? i decided that the best thing to do was to stay put. i called the butler police and asked if it would be alright to spend the night in the little town park i was sitting in. they said it would be fine and i set up camp, feeling badly about my cousin waiting somewhere, not knowing where i was till he got home...       "
357,"the roads in kansas are great, and the drivers even better. once i got on us 59 south, i even had a generous shoulder, which is something i hadn't had in a while. it was gorgeous prarie scenery, with old abandoned farm houses and grain silos. lots of hawks, several more snakes... reaching us54 at the end of a gradual but long climb was like reaching your driveway at the end of a long trip. it felt like the home stretch, even though i'm no more than 1/8th of the way into my trip. the road was long and smooth and mostly flat, with more good shoulder most of the way. iola is an awesome little town. riding in was like riding into the movie dazed and confused. they had the sonic burger drive in eatery, the small town feel, all of it. really beautiful little town. and tj's got a nice house. i was impressed. he fixed me up a huge pasta dinner with his own sauce and several guinness. his couch is so freakin comfortable it's unbelievable. i got to talk to my aunt sandy(his mom) on the phone too. haven't had the opportunity to do that in a while.. we watched movies and talked till about 11:30, when we were both ready to crash.

362,"as the sun rose, the riding became more difficult with a crosswind from the south west. the wind didn't change direction, route 50 did. upon reaching dodge city, on the 50 bypass, i was waved right past a collision that had cars backed up for a mile. suckers. the bypass turned south once more into the wind, but it was only for less then a mile, when i turned north west and caught a 'get the hell outa dodge' tailwind till ten at night. at that point, i was pulled over. the officer explained, after asking my intentions and destination, that several people(i could tell only one, and he knew that i knew) had called and notified him of a cyclist swerving into traffic. i had swerved past the white line once, while looking over my shoulder at the approaching cars that were several hundred yards back. a cyclist can't help but to wobble a little bit when they get hit with the big truck turbulence, but that never caused me to swerve more than a few inches, and never into the path of vehicles. i also had my lights off, in an effort to save batteries, if i was to ride all night, which is dumb and illegal.  the officer suggested, in a friendly but firm way, that i spend the night at the rest area about 4 miles up the road. so i did, since i was to be on that road all the way through colorado, and he would probably be patrolling it for most of the night. i planned on getting up around three am and continuing, but i knew that as soon as my head hit the pillow i was gonna be out.                 "
363,"between the lost time of last night and the inevitable lost time this wind will cost me, i have no chice but to catch  bus from garden city to make it to vegas on time. only dilemma; this wind wont let me safely ride, and i wont make it to garden city in time walking to catch the only bus that leaves before four am tomorrow. my only double jointed feature is that i can bend the top half of both my thumbs backwards 90 degrees(on their own). this is commonly called a hitch-hikers thumb, and i put it to good use with every pickup truck i managed to spot. finally had an old timer named orville pick me up and drive me right to within a block of the bus station. he will probably never read this, so if one of his kids, grandkids, nieces, nephews, whoever read this, thank him again for me. he helped me out big time and i really appreciate it.  i bought my ticket, disassembled my bike, wrapped it up into a neat little package with my blanket, and settled in for the worst ride of my trip."
364,"when our bus was called, the line of newcomers was long. that means a crowded bus ride to add to the already present discomfort. at least the reboarders are allowed on first. i get my seat and wait. luckily, im tall and broad shouldered enough to look uncomfortable to sit next to. Brooke, the girl from the cafe, makes her way back and i do my best to make myself look smaller, a little less imposing. it works, much to the jealousy of the guys across the way, who were blatantly vying for her company.  shes a traveller of sorts, on her way from taos to her boyfriends in san diego. we had some decent conversations about our travels, and shared photos. eventually we both worked our way into the difficult struggle to find a comfortable sleeping position on a crowded bus, next a relative stranger..."
365,"the people in this terminal are weird, in a bad way, or disgusting, or some combination of the two. i find some sleep on a bench and eventually board the bus. it's a different bus all together, which means i have to carry all my shit off and back on with me... the kids across the way and i become more friendly this morning. they are on thier way to vegas to sell magazine subscriptions. it's a paid trip(by thier employers), plus a minimum $20 per day while they are out there... it's  the first time west for both of them, nick and joe.  15 minute layover in kingman. i reboard and nick is on the bus, in his seat, but joe is still in mcdonalds. a rather dirty looking, and stinky homeless guy boarding there eyes up joe's seat. he asks me if the person sitting there will mind the company, and i reply ""probably not, but you don't want to sit there, he smells really bad."". bum walks forward a couple of seats and parks it with someone who was sleeping. nick and i silently chuckled. joe was a little offended when we told him after the guy got off in bullhead city, but i saved him(and me) from having to sit next to some bum who did in fact stink. joe didn't stink. at least not noticeably. it's not like i was sniffing the guy. finally reached vegas. reassembled my bike and made my way down to the sands convention center. i got the room key to fred, chris, and mike's room, and headed to the mirage for a shower. i had to check my bike with the bell desk, which actually worked out quite nicely. after that, it was back to the trade show for friends, free beer, as many energy bars as you could eat and the general first day of interbike atmosphere. a bit of a mix between the jet/travel lag of almost everyone there, and the desire to party. at one point lloyd from if asked me if it was me they quoted in dirt rag, and i had no idea what he was talking about. i eventually made my way over there, and immediately, joel and mike where like hey, check this out. they quoted me from our conversations at pedrosfest on one of the first few pages.  """"and then one day i realized i could just leave..."" sean, single speed nomad"" show closed for the day, i ride up and down the strip a bit, then end up at the vagabond hotel, where the IF/Dirt Rag/whoever else(sorry) where hanging out. ended up getting treated to a delicious, delivered, thai food buffet. yummy. maurice, thanita, and a few others, one on an awesome tall bike, made our way over to double down for the surly sponsored punk rock show. the ride there was a chaotic combination of sidewalk assault, derby, and bike repair. we didn't even make it inside. there was a line of yuppies out the door. so we hung outside and then went for another ride, meandering back to the vagabond. night ended with me crashing the floor at the shop crews room."
366,"once at the trade show, chris and cucci(mike) went straight for the unnaturally overpriced food vendors, and i went straight for the huge and free assortment of energy bars and drinks that companies were 'sampling'. that was basically my daily routine at the show. the free beer and other assorted alchoholic drinks started flowing in the afternoon.  i had decided, due partially to my original intentions, and largely to the unsolicited encouragement of several friends, that today would be ""sponsor me day"". so i made the rounds, talked to the vendors that interested me. when i get to california, where most bike companies are located, i'll be getting some 'pro deals', and some products to test.  after the show, i got a call from my friend chris mariano, whom i went to art school with. he had made it to town and was looking to meet up, but it wouldn't happen tonight as my night was already booked. was taken out to dinner at the outback steakhouse by fred, with the rest of the shop crew, plus lenosky/clark/chase. we snaked some seats by walking right past the line and seating ourselves. it was at this point that i completely blew the vegan bit, but hey, what happens in vegas, stays in vegas, or something like that. i ate a bunch of buffalo wings, a bloomin onion, and mine and half of fred's steak. ended up at the mirage again. early night."
367,"ate my normal buffet of energy bars, the breakfast of champions, and enjoyed the last day of the show.  .talked to the RAAM(race across america) people. they were stoked on some of the distances and times i had achieved. i see myself trying that in a few years.  .scored a new seat from Vince, the shops serfas rep. .got reassured about the trailer i'll be testing for a company. .watched jpr from faction mag get felt up by some creepy old industry guy at the little devil booth. .said my goodbyes to all my biking friends... after seeing the guys from the shop off, i called chris and went about locating him at the excalibur hotel, where i had no problem bringing my bike up to his room. the only other time i had seen him in some 4-5 years was at a wake. we immediately went cruising the nickel slots, like the high rollers we are. after a bit of that nonsense, we made our way to the boardwalk casino to kill thier buffet. 2.5 hours of eating almost nonstop and catching up on old times. we outlasted many people and drew some amusing comments from one particular group. they came in after we had been there for an hour and a half already, sat down and ate all they could. when they were done, we were still making laps. chris and i walk back with yet another round of plates to hear someone from thier party remark ""those guys can EAT!!"". good for some chuckles. upon my next attack of the dinner menu, the female of the group dropped jaw with an ""oh my GO-OD!?!?!"", in sort of a mix of astonishment, disbelief, and i'm sure a little disgust. that's right honey, this guy can eat. we each had a couple of more trips after they left, till we could no longer walk upright for fear of our bellies splitting open and giving the buffet back all that we took.  the way i look at it, i pay $10, i want 10 pounds of food damnit. thats how much i would get at a grocery.   "
368,"after lounging by the pool, where i missed an oddly shaped spot with the sun tan lotion and ended up with some weird sunburn tattoos, we went to see fulcrum(? chris, help me out on this one), an incredible motown quartet; and then half of purple reign""THE prince tribute band""'s set at boardwalk. i won $20 on quarter slots. i was up $40 at one point, but was happy with what i walked away with.           "

370,"riding east on lake mead blvd through north las vegas, i considered the options for living there, but decided to press on. stopped at a bike shop around 11. they were supposed to be open but weren't. i worked in a shop for three years. i know the deal. posted opening times are tentative for a half hour... it turned out to be a really good, bmx friendly shop. i got great route info... as i neared the top of the pass between sunrise and frenchman mountains, i turned back for a picture of the skyline only to find out just how good of a decision it was to leave. i could barely see the stratosphere with all the smog blanketing the valley. for a while i thought i was in the the desert in star wars. i wouldn't have been shocked at all to see luke skywalker come ripping around one of the hills in a speeder. the further i got from vegas, the better the desert got. until that is, i almost ran out of water. i had passed a travelling cyclist who was also headed south for the winter. he was resting under the shade of his tarp draped over his bike. it was 3:30 before i realize dthe wisdom in his decision. i rested for a half hour or so under my own version of his set up. while packing up, and wondering when i would find more water, a lady driving with her son stopped and asked if i was alright. i said ""yes"", but asked if they had hany extra water. she said ""no, but offered me a cold gatorade which i gladly accepted. i rationed it well, sipping it only occasionally. climbing one hill, i saw the first red rock formations i would come to see. amazingly beautiful, it was like some kind of free form abstract sculpture in the middle of a desert grassland. there was a picnic area there, with a ""no camping"" sign, but i decided to set up there anyway, out of view behind some of the rock formations. i figured i would just wait till it was getting dark to go set up.  went and checked out the interpretive trail through the formations, which provides all sorts of historical and geological information on the area. it led back to the picnic area where a fellow named jeff and his family now were taking a break mid drive after spending the day on a relative's boat on lake mead. i asked if they happened to have any water and was surprised to be offered as much as i needed from the five gallon jug they where toting around in the back of their minivan. they also offered me food from their stockpile of bologni and cheese sandwiches, but i assured them i had plenty of food. i did have dried peas and lentils, potatoes and some hickory nuts, but i was referring to the plenty of food still digesting in my belly from texas station that morning.  the last people to pull in before dark creeped me out a little at first. two guys in a windowless, beat up white van. one gets out to toss some trash in one of the dumpsters. upon returning to the van the other(the driver) goes, ""hey, theres a guy(me) over there maaaan."" in a somewhat distorted social accent. i was sitting at a picnic table with some bushes blocking our view of each other. ""yeah"", replies the first one, with obvious dissinterest. to me, ""WHAT'S UP DUUUDE?"", offers the driver. i give him a drawn out ""YO"" and everything is ok. very big lebowski.         "
371,"i woke up and it was already past sunrise. i scrambled to take down the tent. as i was about halfway through the process, a bunch of hot rods rumbled into the rest area parking lot. i only caugh a glimpse of two of them, but they were awesome, really gorgeous! now if only they weren't pollution mobiles. once on my way i had a short uphill followed by a long, winding, gentle downhill. the most beautiful stretch of road so far. i eventually made it to echo bay, and rolled down to check out the scene. i learned about desert plants, picked up some maps, filled up on water, and made some phone calls. on the way out, i decided to call it an off day and camp at one of the free spots near stewarts point. along the way i ran into a couple of hot spring oases along the side of the road. i found myself a nice spot, right on the shore of lake mead. had a swim, 'cooked' some lentils and peas in the sun in a glass jar. it was a nice, relaxing day. there *WERE* other families around. most with boats, many with kids, both of which made plenty of noise, but it was bearable.                 "
372,"i think i may have finally worked all of the texas station buffet out of my system. i'm finally hungry. 2 1/2 days later. tomorrow, i ride for overton, resupply there, then charge for mesquite at the arizona border, do laundry there, then ride through the heat of the day into utah if i can.       "
373,"6 miles up road at logandale, i rode past the autoparts/bicycle store and hung a right into the town park. riding a 3/4 lap around it, i passed the pool, which appeared open and unmanned. i considered a dip and a shower(which i no doubt needed), but held out for the picnic tables in the shade on the other side. it was here that i ran into tony, who may have singlehandedly changed the outcome and direction of this trip, and will have at least had a major impact on it. he had been let out of work early today, due to circumstances beyond his control(the whole crew was let out early), and was relaxing the afternoon away with a few beers in the shade. he shared his beer with me and we both shared out stories. we talked about travel, experiences and family. he told me about his beautiful scottish wife back home and their 7 sons, where he came from and where he was headed. he has lived quite an exciting life. we talked about work. we talked about mesquite, the next town on my trip. he told me of mesquite, the oasis in the dessert with cheap as hell buffets, where i would arrive and not want to leave. he told me of his friend who should be able to give me work for a while. i agreed that i might like it too much to part ways with the place. after we exchanged contact information and said our goodbyes, i headed off for the mystical town. actually, i headed for the ""water station"" where i should be able to camp just before the long downhill into mesquite. the miles passed, and i noticed all the litter lining the the bike-allowed freeway. that's a pet peeve tony and i discussed and share. litter, not bikes on freeways. a little further along the flat expanse, among all the beer bottles/cans and fast food wrappers, i spotted and scored the roadside litter equivilent of gold. 3, count em, three, perfectly good, unused kodak disposable cameras, and not ten feet away, an almost full box of sealed tubes of ritz crackers. i grabbed the three that were in good condition. it was getting dark somewhere between mile 110 and 112, so i pulled into a truck parking area(amenityless), and laid my bed roll down on the bare earth on the far side of some mounds of dirt(out of sight of the parked trucks. i didn't even change, just donned my vest and settled in for the free planetarium show in the desert sky.   "
374,"freeway 15 has a generous shoulder for the entire time i've been on it. from the truck parking area all the was to the oasis casino/hotel in mesquite was 10 miles of sweet, sweet downhill through some gorgeous desert. left at 6:30 and was in mesquite before 7. the $1.99 buffet actually turned out to be $5.49. perhaps tony was thinking of a different casino or it had simply been a while since he was in town. the water station was nonexistant, but all of that is ok. i had plenty of water, and $5.49 is decent for a good buffet. saw two old couples at the buffet, together, that personified the elderly casino goer(even though i have seen very few that actually fit that description). the ladies were dressed to the nines, but in clothes from a different era. very carol channing. the men wore their southwest pastel colored golf shirts tucked into their dress slacks. they were somewhat fixated on me as they waited in the omelet line. could have been because i was simply in their line of sight, but it made me think of them as cult members from the movie rosemary's baby. i didn't have to check my bike at the casino here, unlike vegas. just locked it up where ever. i went down and used the casino's laundromat and scored a free shower in the gym locker room while i was at it.  i couldn't get through to tony today. something about the number being out of the service area. i'll try again tomorrow i suppose. the spaghetti all you can eat at the oasis was crap. overcooked with watery sauce and too greasy garlic bread. i managed to down four plates and 3 iced teas. this town is basically small town, usa, with a few casinos thrown in to screw things up. i'm beginning to not like it here, after only one day. got a decent photo of a black widow spider, decided that i can ride to kansas and back on my way back up, and that i should just go check out the canyons in utah and then head for california. i sort of wish i were still at lake mead right now. i think i'll go nap at the lds church park i spotted earlier. im not getting a motel, not for 10 hrs. heheh, that song, ""sunshine, on my shoulders, makes me happy..."" just came on over the soundsystem. it made me happy...   "
375,"i stopped at the nevada welcome center and received some excellent info and advice on my route and the grand canyon from one of the guys who works the desk there. he actually grew up in piscataway, nj. small world. i spent another $4 today on a one day rec center membership. gives me access to showers, pools, weight room, game room, outlets and air conditioning all day. turns out it actually broke 100 degrees here yesterday. probably close to that today. so im sitting out the midday sun here in the rec center. i'll follow it up with a few laps in the pool and, i truly fear, a buffet. they're just too irresistable. if i can't get in touch with tony and i leave tomorrow, i'll have to go pretty early to make the wilderness area in arizona or the national forest in utah before it gets too hot. im sure i have a fair amount of climbing out of this valley. (later in the day) amazingly, i finally got through to tony. i was having my doubts. but he was at work. we talked for a few minutes and he asked if i could call back later, in a few hours specifically. ""i move like a river. i have a path, but depending on how i cut the land before me, how the weather cuts me, and how people change my intentions, my path may change at any moment, and i will simply flow with it. if only i could only flow downhill like a river...."" -journal excerpt and so the people build dams. just got off the phone with tony. everything seems to be in order. he's calling his mesquite connection tomorrow, and if that doesn't pan out, he might be able get me some work over in overton. it's early, but i'm tired from my four hours of sleep last night and a day of swimming today. my strength of will succumbed to the strength of all you can eat temptation and i not only tasted but devoured the forbidden fruit of the virgin river buffet. if i stay here too long, i will undoubtedly become fat. $5.25 for a shake and a bottomless coffee. i'm tired as hell but it's only 10:30. i'll give the good people of the local church till 12 before i invade their park for the night.       "
376,"i think that if i eat another buffet, i'm going to have a heart attack. i had the lunch buffet at casablanca casino. it was very good. lots of hitch-hikers in the southwest, of all ages. it seems to be a little more friendly towards them here then back east.  got in touch with tony. the job looks like a sure thing. @ $9 an hour. but i'm making sure not to count my blah, blah, blah. i don't have the job till i have it. stopped by the gallery and the bike shop. ended up hanging out with the shop/bmx crew most of the night. took some decent shots of joel and paul riding at the local skatepark. then headed over to shane's house(he's another local rider), where i was hooked up with dinner, beer, and a buffet comp for the 1 buffet i hadn't tried yet. his dad, as it turns out, is a raw foodist. he was pretty excited, it seemed, to meet another mostly(except for at tjs, and since i reached vegas) one. it renewed my enthusiasm somewhat. crashed in the church park again. watered the wall again... sorry about that.       "
377,            
378,"got back on freeway 15 after a nice mile or so on the bike path, and headed up to route 9.  it rolls down into the aptly named hurricane valley. there was a triathlon going on. i got lots of encouragement from the athletes during the bike stage, which paralleled my route into the town of hurricane. the wind riding up out of the valley was abominable. i ended up accepting a ride to rockville from a nice woman named kelly. thank you kelly. (i subtracted the truck ride from the daily mileage) shane had suggested that i try and get in contact with his friends that lived in springdale, that they would treat me well. so, rolling through town, i stopped at Roberto's, a mexican food joint and as soon as my bike and i were in sight, i was welcomed with open arms and a big glass of iced tea. sitting outside were aaron and amy, inside lucas was working. adam, who i would later realize was the friend shane told me about, pulled in at some point to work.  by 7pm, i was at the local 'house'(called the big house) hanging out with the friendliest, most accomodating, laid back and fun people i had met in a long time. this after tagging along on a shuttle run to one of the local downhill trails where i tried my best to capture a few choice photos.  the night led me to a kick ass desert party, complete with disco ball, strobe light, fire spinners and some more awesome people. met more than i could name if i tried. i slept right next to the fire pit, with a small stack of wood. if i woke up chilly in the night, i just threw another log on...             "
379,"i wasn't sleepy, so i tidied up the area a bit. there was a layer of ice on top of some of the half filled cups. didn't realize that it got that cold. i went for a little hike too, to check out the terrain and one of the local trails. when i got back, a woman named patsy and her partner shared their papaya and coffee with me, and i ended up catching a ride back into town with patsy. i had left some gear in tim's rv, so i assumed it was still there, with him at work. i napped at the big house and lounged around all day. decided to check out zion national park tomorrow, it's the reason i came here anyway."
380,"i managed to strap all the necessary gear for a two day, possibly cold weather hike through a canyon onto my blackburn hydrasak and headed for the park. i got my backcountry pass, but found out you are supposed to be shuttled to the top of the narrows. i'll see if i can't get someone to take me up there tomorrow."

383,"the other two hikers eventually caught up with me as i waited for the sun to hit one section of canyon. reaching the lower narrows, i saw more and more tourists, but not that many. the water is too cold for most southwesterners this time of year, and most other tourists aren't adventurous enough to walk up stream. the upper narrows astounded me, the lower narrows were simply mind boggling. as i walked out towards the road back into town, i saw gary, the paternal part of the duo who were in the narrows with me, sitting on a rock wall drying out. jed, the son, had ridden his bike down to get the truck, and i was offered a lift back into town.  camped out with timmy/arrow and jason."

389,"i woke up at my campsite early, and realized i was out of street clothes that could pass the smell test as 'clean'. so i decided today would be laundry day and that i would head over to shanes at some point, as he offered his washer and dryer for my use. so i packed up my dirty clothes into one pannier, and some gear into another, and left my 'home' around 8am. i took the main trail all the way out to the bunkerville bridge, instead of fording the river or crossing the dam. i had plenty of time to kill before shane would wake up and i wanted to do some exploring. i rode up the dirt road out of town, still unsure of whether i would go right or left at the split about 3 miles in. when i got there i just kept pedalling up the left road, towards the arizona state line and lime kiln canyon. from a distance, it looks like a pass between two mountains, but it turned out to be the longest, gentlest way to go all the way up.  i climbed out of the desert, into scrub oak and steep walls on either side of me. past highland ranches and rock formations till i reached as far as i intended to go. when you cross a cattle grate that is pretty much filled in and useless, you are about 3/4's of the way or more up the mountain, and you look ahead to what seems like two opposing abstract gargoyles, guarding the entrance to the canyon. the road curves immediately after these, and passing through them and around the bend, you realize that what you thought were caves from the other side are really holes going all the way through these giant formations. i climbed up into one, the biggest and most accessible, and realized that several of the other holes feed into this one. it almost looked like a home, with a second floor, rooms, windows, and a front door.  i snapped several pictures, cut up the knuckle of my left pinky finger on the scree coming down out of the hole, and got back on the bike for the ride back down. oddly enough, it felt like a shorter distance riding up than it did riding down. it was long, rough, and extremely fast. it made me wish i had switched to my knobby tires and left the laundry at the campsite. as i came out of the mountains and onto the long gentle grade back down into mesquite, just before the nevada/arizona border, i noted to myself how impressed i was that i didn't pinch flat once on the rocky downhill. knowing better really can't help you when it comes to thought. i knew better, and therefore was not taken back when within a few seconds of thinking that, my rear tire started hissing. i sat down, patched it, ate a honey tangerine, and pedaled down into town.  it's definitely a worthwhile ride, and probably even more so if you head further into the canyon than i did, but make sure you have at least 1.9"" tires and that they are trail worthy. it would be good to leave your gear somewhere too, your unneccessary gear at least. bring plenty of water. you can find some up there, but it is decidedly easier and safer to have it with you ahead of time.

392,"we got to vegas, rode some ditches, went to desert industries, the best thrift stores in the desert southwest, visited shanes relatives, met up with his friend and headed to henderson skatepark in the anthem highlands just south of vegas. it was entertaining to watch all the riders and skaters, and i headed up to the top of the hill, behind the electric substation, to settle down for a cold nights sleep.     "
393,"i rode into a headwind, to as far as i could pedal up the mountain pass that culminates in the tiny town of mountain pass. i was warned of the hill and its penchant for devouring cars and rvs. i didn't realize how serious the warnings were till i noticed the large, charred black spots of molten plastic and broken glass every 50 yards or so  going up the hill. i walked for more than an hour, but it was easy, not like the appalachians where i was leaned as far forward as i could manage to cope with the grade. i simply walked up this hill, with my bike next to me. i don't stop riding for change on the road, but when im walking up hills i do. i collected almost a dollar in change up this hill.. at the top, it got dark quicker than i expected, so i put on warmer clothes, turned on my flasher, and headed downhill for the rest area. i passed three people with steaming hot radiators on the side of the road. the downhill was long and smooth, and i could see the lights of the rest area in the distance. i rolled in under complete darkness at only 5:30 pm. at the beginning of the trip i could ride in daylight till nearly 8. i sat there for a while, chatting with people, who came up interested in the guy with the loaded up bike sitting in a freeway rest area in the cold darkness. one trucking couple told me of a mission in oaxaca where i could stay. they got excited about the idea of travelling for a long time after the kids where out of school and settled into jobs.  one guy kept going back and forth getting water for his thirsty radiator. he asked me where exactly we were, asked about my trip, the usual. it came up that he was headed to LA. he asked where i was headed for now, i said LA. he offered to take me as far as riverside or santa barbara, and faced with the prospect of sleeping in a rest area on a major freeway on a saturday night, i said what the hell, why not. so i loaded all my stuff into his car, and we waited for it to cool down some more. as we were doing so, a french canadian guy, came over to see what was up. my new friend started his car, and the canadian immediately told him it wasn't going anywhere. he saw the steam and water flowing out of the tailpipe and called it as most likely cracked heads. my ride was no longer rolling, and i readied myself to unpack. as the owner of the crack(ed)head car went over to get some more water in hopes that the car would somehow make it, the canadian offered to take me to la in his car. ok. so the transfer began. we somehow managed to get all the gear in his car, on top of all his gear in his back seat. we said fairwell and good luck to kenneth, with the crackhead car, and set off. david, my new ride, is from montreal, on a vacation driving around the us. he had worked on f-1 cars and as a pilot in the arctic. we talked the whole way to LA. in san bernadino, he wouldn't let me pay for gas. we made it to studio city after travelling through the huge expanse of suburban LA and the surounding suburbs. when we reached nick, del and sals, they were out at dinner with dels parents, so we moved all my gear inside. the kids eventually showed up and we all repeatedly offered david a place to crash inside, but all he would accept was a shower and permission to sleep in his car outside. we watched tv till i was too tired to stay up anymore and then i turned in on a real mattress, with a warm sleeping bag, and settled in for the most comfortable nights sleep since my st louis air mattress.

395,"right now, im house sitting for del, sal and nick while they are back east for the holidays. cant wait to get back on the road, but will not be doing so till i get some work and make a little money.  i've ridden about two hundred miles so far while here, around the entire valley, over laurel canyon, up the LA river bike path. i've also, contrary to what a certain song might lead you to believe, have been doing ALOT of 'walking in LA'. i've probably put in at least 100 miles of walking since i got here.  celebrity sightings: kim bassinger. on ventura ave, while i was walking around jobsearching. she was by herself, putting something in her suv. she looked up and gave a friendly smile as i walked by. stephanie lineburg, the redhead from richie rich and blown away(lizzie). more recently parrts on joan of arcadia, er and other shows. grew up a few miles from me, is friends with all of my friends from jefferson. we all end up hanging out a bunch while im here. im sure that there have been more that i just didn't recognize..."
