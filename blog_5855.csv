0,"updates will most likely be weekly, and done by my mom. occasionally i will do it, but most likely, i'll be writing letters in m tent at night, sending them to her, and she'll put in a little info. photos wont come untill at least cancun...  it feels good to be going somewhere again."
1,"my route will be some of the very well mapped out bike route's, lanes and paths from here to tecate. tecate is my goal for the day.       "
2,"3-1-04 Guess I was wrong about Tecate.  I thought it was above the border but he and  it are in Mexico!!!!! seans version: leaving a place with friends and a soft place to sleep is hard to do, but its really nice to be back on the road again. i left at around noon on sunday. the bike infrastructure in san diego is AMAZING. bike lanes and paths everywhere. i stopped at a park just outside of the city and made the last of the phone calls from my cell phone. made it to route 94, and proceeded to go up and down and up and up. then i went up again. lots of big beautiful mountains outside of san diego. i passed a border patrol checkpoint around 4:30. a little further up the road i spotted an unlocked gat to some BLM lands. so i made my way in and found a decent, level spot out of site to set up for the night. some california rednecks were having target practice on the other side of the hill from me. mostly pistols, with some shotgun blasts thrown in for good measure. after it got too dark for them to see what they were shooting at(which was nothing in the first place) they took off. a few hours later, in complete darkness, the coyotes started doing thier thing. i swear they have there own complex language system. if you ever listen to the jibber jabber of coyotes, you will not doubt language in wild animals. they took off for thier late night stroll, and returned around 4am, jibbering just as relentlessly as before.  Those Sierra mountains are bigger than they appear.  From San Diego to Tecate ( Baja California norte) he travelled up mountains that went to 14,000 feet but he never went past 8 or 9,000. (Spectacular scenery.)  That was enough on single speed. Incredible!  Why a single speed?  Ask Sean.  By the time he finally arrived in Tecate  ( before 3:30pm) he was exhausted.  He is staying at one of their more luxurious motels ( $20.00 nightly)just to rest.  Guess he got out of shape in Studio City.  That will teach him not to procrastinate.  Nah!  Nothing will ever teach him that.  Tomorrow he hopes to continue down the Baja California Norte.  He estimates 5-7 days on the Baja and then over to the mainland.  He called on his cell phone.  I don't want to know the cost although it did not read roaming.  Probably just had $$Mom$$ signs on it.  Once he gets his bike legs back he should be making good time.  Mom   "
3,"Sean is the only son with an older and younger sister but large extended Irish families on both sides.  His dad is a retired firefighter and I am a teacher.  He had an idyllic upbringing in the mountains of northwestern NJ.  He went to parochial school before attending art college in Philadelphia.  Sean was living in NYC before the trip.  He has worked many different jobs while trying to exist as an artist;bike messenger ( another dream), construction, freelance photographer, bike repair and sales... Sean is an extremely creative starving artist.  His work does not include pretty scenes for Mom's living room. The Brooklyn Museum would love his work.  His photography is exceptional and more acceptable ( to Mom).  We have no idea where he gets his creativity or originality from. It amazes us. My ancestry goes back to the Vikings on one side and we think there must have been an artist among them.  Sean is the first since then.   He has always been a free spirit. Thirteen years of parochial school did not mold him to comform with our standards.  We love him and accept his dreams.  This trip is one of the many. He began serious riding at age 16 and has done all kinds of riding ( trial, road, mountain ...) since then.  He took courses after college on building a bike from scratch and worked at The Route 15 Bike Shop in Lake Hopatcong (Fred and Chris - this is a plug). He learned the bike trade there.  Sean seriously researched his trip.  When he left he had directions for every bike trail he needed  to cross the US.  He had researched edible vegetation but was disappointed that the rest of the family wouldn't join him to ""graze"" for dinner. I have noticed that he didn't adhere to this method of food gathering or his raw food diet on the trip.  As Grandma used to say ""Beggers can't be Choosers.""  He had a training trip for endurance and basic needs.  His dad and I were impressed with his preparations. He chose to make this trip for himself. A lot of people have asked if he was sponsored or if he was doing it for a cause.  His handouts come from his savings, Mom and those he meets along the way.  Thanks to all who have fed him and given him shelter.  He is certainly not alone on the trip as there are many of us riding along with him, vicariously living a great adventure through Sean.  While this is not his first trip, it certainly is his longest and probably won't be his last.   He likes to speed up my aging process.  For any asthmatics following his travels, he is one of you.  He has flatlined twice in his life but keeps coming back.  He is a chronic asthmatic with triggers in changes in the weather.  Riding has probably given him greater lung capacity but one trigger is all it takes to sideline him.  He is certainly the poster boy for living your life to the fullest while taking some necessary precautions. Anyone who knows Sean understands his desire to make this trip and to do it alone, sleeping in fields, woods and behind dirt hills when he doesn't want to spend his money on normal shelters.  He is a very intelligent and kind soul who loves the outdoors and whose limits know no bounds.  We just hope he comes home safely in time for the triumphvirate ( Mother's Day, his sister's birthday and her college graduation).  His freedom is everyone's dream! Mom

8,"the larger, flatter boulders are painted with colorful slogans, sayings and advertisements. i suddenly feel a comraderie with those in rv's and wave at all of them. they are after all, just doing something similar in a different vehicle.  i passed one house where the dogs(who were actually chained, unlike most of the many free roaming dogs here)came out and barked wildly at me inches from my legs as i ignored them and strolled past. they stopped after i passed the property line, as i expected. i had a delicious meal in valle de las palmas, ordered with the help of an expatriate american from san diego. after that, it was a long, steep walk up a mountain. i was offered a job by a road crew that was sweeping the drain channel on the side of the road. i declined. ""este es mejor que trabajo"", i said, ""this is better than work"". near the top, i saw the first of the caravans of rvs. plates from different states, on a mass exodus from whatever beach they had all been camping on for the winter. not a bad life for anyone... after cresting that hill, it was a series of long rollers into valle guadalupe. there was a sign advertising camping spots just before town, and i didn't think twice about riding right by. it just didn't look very nice. i considered a couple of spots for free camping, but scratched them for the presence of stray dogs.  eventually i came upon a sign for an inn, but the gate was locked and noone was there. the fence continued up to a restaurant which had just closed. i asked a worker if i could camp by the picnic tables for the night, and he asked the boss, Joaquin, who agreed, and gave me my choice of spots and use of the bathroom for free.             "
9,"the owner tried his best to remove my bb, but only succeeded in stripping the teeth of the bb a little with his rounded off remover. the owner of another local shop stopped by and was looking at my bike. he took it over to his shop and it still wouldn't budge. we all figured it would be alright for a little while. i rode off out of town, stopping to fill my water bladder for 10 cents a liter.  out of town, down a long straight road, and entering the hills, i saw a military checkpoint up ahead, and a balneario(bathing resort[kind of like a campground with pools and a water slide]) off to the right. i stopped in at the balneario, and decided to stay. as usual, because it is winter, i had the run of the place.                     "
10,"at the top i encountered David, a gringo who had been in mexico for several months, living on a small ranch on top of the mountain. he was standing on the side of the road trying to bum a cigarette. we talked about bikes for a few minutes. he offered me lunch if i ever passed through again. he told me it was all downhill to san vicente, which was mostly true.  i reached the bottom of the big downhill, at the turnout for coyote cal's, a hostel on the beach. if i had more cash on me, i would have considered heading the 12 miles out to the beach to stay the night there. instead though, it was a march up a mile or two long hill to the top of the other downhill to san vicente. i didn't notice till i got to the top how bad my bb had gotten. it was now making this wretched metal on metal screeching noise with every hard pedal stroke and moving about a half an inch with each revolution. i coasted down the hills and walked up them. even on the flats it was bad. san vicente had no bike shop, and no bank. i asked at a gas station to find that the nearest town with a bank was colonia vicente guerrero, 80 k south. luckily, it was a fairly flat 80 k. i came down through colonet, down into san telmo where i stopped at the pemex station to ask where the campground on the signs was.  ""en le parque national. es 90 kilometers en las cerras."" damn. i wasn't about to ride 90k just to camp, so i sat in a market, eating a bolillo(doughnut) the size of my face. i decided to ride up the park road to the start of the mountains, about 1-2 miles away and try to find a free camp spot, which i did.     "

12,"other than that, mexico has been wonderful. i will put a bunch more info up here later today or tomorrow... gotta run right now. adios- sean"
13,"after couple of hours down there, i walked back into town to check on my bike. it had looked last night like i was going to need a new frame shipped down from the US. everything was set in place, and all i needed to do was say the word and it would be on its way. when i got to the shop, the old man had started to chisel my bb out with a hammer and screw driver. ""mexicangineering"", but it looked like he might be able to do it. so now i only needed a new bb. i went back to the hotel for a siesta. woke up around 3, went and checked on my bike again. all was looking well, and it might be out by monday. i went to the internet cafe to update everyone, then out to dinner(a reasonable dinner). everyone seems to be really impressed with my spanish down here. i think it has more to do with my accent. i'm pretty good at taking them on, so when i do talk in spanish, i sound like a mexican. it's the only possible explanation, because i feel like i know so little spanish, even though i do seem to be able to communicate really well. after dinner, i headed over to the shop. i needed to borrow my bike for sunday(tomorrow), since they weren't going to be working and i had no other way to get my bags over to the campground. i walked around the corner, down the dirt road, and spotted Ramon, the nephew of the owner, out front with my bike. ""is fixed!"" he exclaims. i am a little confused, until i realize that my bike is sitting there with a new(basic) bottom bracket all ready to go. turns out that in the hour and a half i was in the cafe and the restaurant, he had chiseled out the old one, re-cut the threads, and found a useable new one. i was ecstatic, needless to say. when i asked how much, ""$150 pesos"". that's less than $15. i gave him $200 pesos and refused the change when he offered it to me. went back to the hotel and enjoyed a bunch of great movies on ""golden 3"" the only station the hotel gets.         "
14,"when i got back to the campground, a caravan of rv'rs had pulled in and were set up for the night. i went to bed early.           "
15,"on the advice of the rv tour leader, who has extensive bike touring experience, i should avoid route 1 through the desierto central if i can. so south of Playa el Soccoro, i will try to take the dirt roads and go along the beach. this will save me some serious danger of getting run off the road by a senile rv'er, and save me some serious hills in the process. i will have to take extra food and water though. not a problem. i have a ten liter dromedary bag, a 2.5 liter 'camelback', and a water bottle. that should be enough to get me from rancho to rancho. --------* well, i left CVG around 12-1, and arrived in el socorro around 3:30. there was a heavy mist sitting on the beach, coming in off the ocean. i rode into a place that was right on the beach, and had a sign saying ""rv's welcome"". they let me camp for free, but i was told there are very few if any whales there, and i will most likely see only their spray, if anything at all. i set up camp and walked the rocky beach for a while. at around 5-5:30, as the sun was setting, a couple from colorado rolled in in their rv. dutch had worked for coors,among other jobs, and loved travelling. his wife, didn't like travelling too much. i hung out with them for a few hours swapping stories, and had to borrow a flashlight to find my tent, for the the full moon was completely obscured by a heavy mist at that point. once the mist cleared, i had nearly enough light to read in my tent.         "
16,"10:45 am- to hell with it, i came here to ride. i'm off to the market to resupply, then up into the desert. if you don't hear from me for a while, it's because a gringo in an rv ran me into a ditch and i'm either dead on the side of the road or limping to the nearest town. adios. back in contact and updating now in guerrero negro(which means black warrior. something to do with pirates i think.)  i left el rosario and headed up, up, and up. it was hilly, but nothing like the appalachians. there was no shoulder, but there was also very, very little traffic. most people passed me in the other lane. when there were two cars coming from both directions, i just got off to the side of the road. the scenery up there is gorgeous. lush and green, not your typical desert. Dr. Suess must have visited baja before he began his writing carreer, because a type of tree/cactus they have here looks like it came straight out of one of his books.  as per murphy's law, halfway up one of the hills the hose on my water bladder(hydration backpack) disconnected itself and spilled half my days water down my back, my left leg and eventually to the ground before i could reconnect it and zip tie it. i should have zip tied it a long time ago. it has done this before and i had zip ties that i found on the side of the road in the states. anyway, i was already tired and feeling the effects of the strong sun. i was told about the random restaurants all throughout the desert, i just didn't know how far the first one was. i asked a road crew worker and he told me seis kilometers. i was thrilled because by that point i had taken the last sip of water in my pack and was halfway through my water bottle. seis passed, the 7,8,9,10,11,12 before i saw one of those wonderful little blue signs with a knife and fork on them, letting travellers know of a restaurant nearby. i pulled in and immediately recognized it as the restaurant where Louie(Touring Louie) and a few others had stayed by the hammock outside. i'd had enough, so i asked if i could camp there for the night. for dinner, i had instant soup(it's not much of a dinner place apparently) and four sodas, because they had no water. i watched some mexican tv in the living room they have set up inside. i slept in the hammock under a canopy of palm. i was careful to put my sneakers on something that kept them out of reach of the dogs who stole Louie's sandals.                   "
17,"after leaving my new amigo with his ártwork', i passed through one of the most beautiful places i have ever seen. the next 20k were on par with zion national park. it was a smooth, winding road through a boulder field with bright green cactus and dr suess trees 20 ft tall and countless other desert foliage.      at catavina i pulled into the rv park, where one of the people who lived there told me 39pesos, but with no water, electric or bano(bathroom). when she went to get change for my 40 pesos, and a man came back telling me 50 pesos. i figured what the hell, im already here, and i don't want my right leg to get any more sunburnt. i picked a spot and recognized one of the views from photos taken by the guy at the campground in colonia vicente guerrero. i saw a stray sitting in the shade of an rv and it became giddy when it saw me. as it weakly approached, i became horrified at the malnourishment. i could see all its ribs, probably fit my hands around its midsection(it was a big dog), and her teets were sagging and full of milk, which obviously means she is or was feeding. i try not to give food to strays, they need to learn how to fend for themselves, but i couldn't resist giving it a few fig newtons. it really broke my heart to see it like that.  since they are overcharging for the facilities, and they have no bathroom, which i really need to use, i'm gonna take a dump in a plastic bag and leave it in their garbage can. that'll show em. bastards.                             "
18,"the only other visitor to the campground that night was another bc canuck with an rv. at about 6pm last night, he started up his rv and moved it about 50 meters, the stopped. it all seemed very random. now, this morning, he is walking towards me with the emaciated bitch following happily. ""i thought i was the only one here."", he said, and that started our friendly, but rather insignifigant conversation. we never exchanged names. it was the ""where ya from?"", ""how long ya been on the road?"" and ""which direction ya headed?"" type of small talk so typical of the conversations i have with most rvers. they are almost always cheery and friendly, but rather generic for the most part. i wonder if thats how i'll be in my rv years, if they ever come. riding through the boulders and cactus in such a heavy fog was even more beautiful than in the hot sun of the day before. eventually, it seemed more as if i rode out of the fog than it dissipated. it would be 32 miles of basically nothing till i reached chapalla, which is a dry lakebed at 2,100 feet. the road from el pedrogroso turns for the worse, very rough and in parts gravelly. but as soon as you hit the laguna chapalla flats(you will see the big white lakebed in the distance), it improves drastically and is like that most of the rest of the way. i stopped in chapalla for some beans and tortillas, and some soda since they have no purified water or juice. there are a bunch of army officers outside giving each other haircuts. one is inside watching mexican cartoon network via sattelite and a huge truck battery. it's a mexican cartoon about mexican wrestlers(with the masks) and a little boy. very entertaining and i understood most of it.  the rest of the days miles where on a mostly flat, smooth road through a cactus forest. as the forest thinned out a little in one spot, i found found myself in the precarious position of riding through a swarm of bees. thousands of them, hitting me and my bike from the right side. i didn't get stung, but was paranoid that they were killer bees and a few were clinging to my bags stunned, and would sting me once i stopped. the forest picks back up again and continues for the rest of the day.  i rode about 7 of the 8 or 9 miles to punta prieta from the bajia de los angeles junction, along which there is the most perfect desert free camping i have ever seen.i set up my tent with enough time to take a short hike and catch up on my journal. i got another tire liner flat today. i think my freewheel might be going too... a big rabbit with huge ears glowing pink in the falling sun approached my tent as i sat there writing. as i reached for my camera though, it spotted me and casually went in the other direction.                               "
19,"from there it was consistant rolling hills through the misty, overcast morning. i thought i had rolled right past the santa rosalillita turn off. i figured i would just keep riding to guerrero negro. i noticed my rear tire was soft, so i go to pull over. it was there that i noticed the small wooden sign for santa rosalillita. i fixed my tire(a patch needed to be reglued, not the one from yesterday), and turned down the road. it was paved for the first mile or three. then it turns into a maintained gravel road. it was heavily washboarded and potholed, and where it wasn't, the gravel was deep enough to make it tough going. i looked down into the raving the road followed, and it looked much more manageable on a bike,  so i dropped down and followed the jeep roads through there. i eventually came upon a series of abandoned shanties on the right, and when i looked to the left i was greeted by a beautiful sandy beach with crystal clear water and dolphins jumping out of the water about 30 meters out. rolled around into sr, where i met a father and son who were camped on out on the point, basically 3/4 of the way down the jeep road i planned on taking anyway. i got some supplies at the grocery store and headed out. i stopped a lot on that trail, to check out the beach, or some caves along the rocky shore. the road followed the shoreline all the way out. gorgeous beaches and nice waves where my view till i reached the point and found the 'L'shaped rock piles, bunkers against the wind, set up to pitch your tent in. no charge, no baños. a surf spot. a couple pulled in with boards and a kayak on top of thier truck from the oppositte direction as i was pushing my bike through a 100 ft stretch of deep sand. Joaquin and Marshell(sp?) are surfers from the tahoe area of cali. i pick a bunker, set up, and watch some of the surfers out on the waves. i want to do that... went for a walk around the point before sunset. met up with Joaquin and Marshell on the way back. had a few beers and chatted as the sun went down. we were going to pool resources for dinner, but they said i needed my food more than they did and treated me to a delicious meal. Joaquin offered to let me try one of his boards tomorrow.               "
20,"i hung around camp some more and cleaned up the rope i made from agave fibers this morning on my hike. its about three feet  or more long and strong as hell.chatted with Joaquin and Marshell again. it was a bit to cold for me to surf today without a wetsuit. the offer still stands for tomorrow morning. finally made my way over to the dinner, which was great. they were really fun people and i had a good time and ate some good food. i hadn't even considered it, but there are mice/rats living in the rockpiles. they aren't filthy like the city rodents i'm used to, and they aren't at all bashful, coming right up to your feet.         "
21,"i finally noticed some movement in J&M's camp, Marshell was back from her walk. i ambled on over and she told me there was a seal playing around in the nice, swimable tidal pool next to where tim was surfing. i ran and got my camera, told Sebastian about it and headed over. sure enough, there was a 5ish foot long seal swimming around. i walked around the rocks, and got a few shots of him. also photographed some coral and a really brightly(almost florescent) colored snail. Sebastian made it around and offered to take my picture with the seal, so i gave him my camera and started swimming in. the seal was much more bashful now, and the only shot we got turned out blurry. Tim was in the pool now too, which made the seal even more shy. he would stay under for long periods of time. Tim and Sebastian left, and i walked around with my camera in the sometimes chest deep water. got a few good shots of the guy, but that is not the point. i was swimming in a clear tidal pool in mexico, alone with a seal, for about 15 minutes. amazing!!! while walking back to camp, i stopped at J&M's to show them my pics. they were eating lunch and insisted i have a plate. it was really good. while heading back to my camp, Tim and Sebastian asked my about the road heading into santa rosalillita. they told me we(the three of us) would cook up whatever fish they get for dinner tonight. they refused some pesos when i offered. then, from about noon to about three, Joaquin, Marshell and i WENT SURFING!!. it's difficult, especially the paddling and getting through the waves that have just broken in front of you. i got hit square in the face with the board trying to get through one of em. i caught a few waves, bellyriding them into shore, and got to my feet in a crouched position(with my hands still on the sides of the board), for a few seconds on one of em. by that time i was getting a little cold and tired, so we called it a day. when we were driving back, time and Sebastian had already returned from the fish camp. i got dropped off at my campsite to dry my clothes out. went over to Tim and Sebastians, and we made 'zen rock piles till the sun turned red on the horizon. then we cooked up the halibit, beans, rice and tortillas. they again refuse payment for the fish. after dinner, we sat up, Tim playing guitar and Sebastian and i doing most of the ""conversationalizing"". we talked about my trip, animals, the stars, planets(you could see venus, jupiter and mars at night now), california and whatever else came up. i eventually went back to my tent and fell asleep peacefully. GREAT DAY!!!!!                   "
22,"about a mile or so down the jeep road out, i was passed by a couple of dirt bikers. they turned around and came back to talk to this loaded down bike tourist miles from any paved road. John and Jack are touring baja from san diego to cabo, almost completely offroad. that's pretty damned cool. we got pics of each other and kept going. the rest of the trail out was fun and not too rough, but i wouldn't recommend it on a road bike. the road was mildly hilly to villa jesus maria, where i stopped for breakfast. i was waved through another military checkpoint. good thing, because if they found the 100 kilos of cocaine i have in my bags i'd be screwed. the rest of the way to Guererro negro was fairly flat, sunny, but with a cool breeze blowing in off the ocean. finally had my tourist card checked at the state line, and now i am here, in Guererro negro. i've got a hotel for the night. i really needed a shower. it was going on 7 days. i'll check out the whales tomorrow in scammons lagoon, and then see how far south i can make it. next update will be in baja california sur.               "
23,"while sitting in the internet cafe typing what you just read, two girls pop in and ask the girl behind the counter where the bank is. i need to go there too. i don't think its far. she tells them 7 or 8 minutes further. i quickly finish up and take off on my bike about 5 minutes after them. they must have run, because the bank for some reason is on the other side of town. i got there, got my dinero for the whale tour and sprinted back, figuring i would see the girls on the way. they looked like tourists, and the only reason a tourist would be rushing to the bank just before 11 here is to catch the 11 am whale tour. i didn't see them. got to the laguna tours station, to find that they weren't going out because there wasn't enough people. they call malarimo tours and have them hold a spot for me, but i don't have time to drop off my key at my motel. i figured i would lose my deposit. i sprinted off to malarimo. got on the bus, and there are the two girls, sitting there, not out of breath at all. i later found out they ran to the bank and hitched a ride back. the bus ride out included a really nice, informative presentation of some incredible facts about the whales, all in english. we got to the dock and were separated into two groups, 9-10 to a boat. off we sped into the bay for our experience with the whales. in the distance we could see them jumping, almost their entire bodies out of the water. impressive considering they weigh several tons and are up to 50 ft long. before long, we found a bunch of whales who would come right up to the boat, rub their backs on it, splash us with their tails, come up next to the boat to let us scratch thier backs. it was incredible. on the way back we stopped at a buoy with about a dozen seals lounging on top and swimming around. i was about three feet from them, barking at them and they barking back. the sand dunes surrounding the bay, a wildlife refuge, are huge and gorgeous.  when we got back, i was talking to the two girls, and found out that their boat didn't really get close to that many whales, and none of them got to touch any. the buoy their captain got them close to had only a few seals, and they only got to within maybe twenty feet of it. i attribute it all to our talented capitan juan. he did a great job.  when we all got back, i went to the hotel to turn in my key; and surprise, surprise; got my deposit back with a smile. i went to the laundromat. then decided, because of the hour, to stay at a different hotel, las ballenas, which is 19 a night.                 "
24,"every time i saw a stray roadkill, i thought how deserving it would be for the person who threw my little friend out the window to crash down an embankment, out of sight, be stuck in their car and die of dehydration/starvation. such is probably the fate of that little tiny, loveable puppy. i stopped in vizcaino to refill on water, and upon leaving the store, who do i see but antonio, the guy who had me paint ""dios es amor"" on the back of his portable empty house. he was visiting some friends before heading to cabo. he loved my photos of the whales. from there it was a scorching hot 45 miles to san ignacio. i stopped at one point, after nearly an hour in the saddle, and nearly collapsed when i put my feet down. i stood in the minimal shade of a road sign and ate a bag of grapes and some oranges. the cool water in my insulated bag had become hot. finally rolled through the military checkpoint, and down into what i thought was san ignacio, but was only the outskirts. rolled into the first rv park i saw. there was noone at the officina/cabana, so i rolled in and found a secluded spot. set up and went over to say hi and happy saint pattys day to my rving neighbors. Rich, Steve and Lee are down here on a vacation/fishing trip. Rich, as it turns out, is originally from sparta, the next town over from where i grew up. he's a cyclist too, but has been in maryland for some 15 years. they feed me beer and fish, and i split my papaya with them.               "
25,"rode up and out towards las tres virgenes volcanos. the three virgins, extinct, shoot straight up some 6,000 feet from the desert floor. there were two incredible downhills today, and plenty of long gradual uphills. had another patch failure before riding down the hill to the coast. when i hit the coast, all of a sudden, i fel a little more resistance, and my rear wheel was making more noise than usual.  all of a sudden, about 3 kilometers outside of santa rosalia, the wheel completely seized. i tried all i could to fix it, but alas, my bike is smarter than me, and has managed to find the two problems that i can't fix with the tools i have. and it found them in mexico, where bike shops are few and far between, and are generally working with worn out, understocked tools. i push/drag my behemoth to a fish taco stand and sit down to have some fresca's. i watch the mexican version of 'family feud' on the television with the proprietor. out of nowhere, he offers to drive me around town to try and find someone who can fix it. he closes up shop for siesta, i load my bike in the back of his vehicle, and we head out.  he probably drove me around for an hour before we found some guys willing to try to fix it. it looked like they had it. we had to rig up some tools, because they had no thin wrenches, which are necessary to tighten the nuts. when i asked how much, they said nothing. i gave them 20 pesos each. about two bucks each. then Enrique, from the taco stand, asks me ""donde?"" where?. i say a hotel. ""que hotel?"", barata. cheap. he takes me to one that is a mix between a hostel and a hotel. 14 a night. i discover that the wheel is not fixed. it wont work. i hang out with Norman, the other gringo there tonight, who has done a transcontinental ride back in 99, via his own route. he buys me a few beers. i go to bed around 9.               "
26,"i consider the possibility of buying a boat for cheap off of a fisherman, and rowing down the coast to lapaz or loretto, where there will surely be a shop. i stop into a little store and buy some sandals for 12 bucks. the owner tells me in english that there is a bike shop in mulege. i decide to take the bus there and back. its only $7 each way. so off i go with my wheel. i got here, found the bike shop, only to find out that the guy is on siesta till 5. it was 1 when i got here. so, im off to explore this beautiful little town some, hopefully the guy can fix it. if not, tomorrow i look for a boat. after the internet cafe, i headed for the local watering hole, el candil. in there i found dennis and bill, two expatriates who retired down here ten or more years ago. had a few negra modellos with them and chatted about the possibilities with my trip. a guy named don stopped walked by, saw me and my wheel and asked if everything was going to be alright. he was behind me on the bus. he left mt shasta california on the bus with no specific destination in mind, he's made it this far, and intends on continueing. 4:45 rolled around, and i paid my tab and headed for the bike shop, which, as it turns out, was still on siesta. so i walk back up into town to the only atm, which is actually just a credit card machine at a pawn shop run by another expatriate who married a mexican woman and has been down here for quite some time. he doesn't have any canoes or rwoboats at the current time. i run into joaquin and marshell, who are in town buying ice for thier campsite 15 miles south of town on the bahia de conception. i tell them about my puppy, and they promise to keep an eye out, but all three of us know the likelihood that the little guy is still alive, let alone hanging out where i left him. they are on thier way to el candil. i head over to the bike shop, and my my, it is open. mexican bike mechanics are the best. they can make anything work for almost nothing. it feels/sounds like my bearings are shot, but hopefully they are good enough to get me to la paz, where i should be able to find new ones. i stop by el candil just as joaquin and marshell are finishing thier dinner. they invite me to camp with them on playa escondido tomorrow.  walking to the bus station, i pass the swiss couple, and chat for a while. incredible sunset while waiting for the bus.             "
27,"it's a quick ride, with few hills, most concentrated near the two big towns. i roll along to snap-crackle-pop of the drive side bearings in my rear wheel turning into pebbles. i begin to realize that there is no way i will make it to la paz on my current set. eventually, i get a grinding metal sound, and know that its time to walk... it's about 12-14 miles to mulege. i've walked much further before. i ignore the desire to hitch a ride for quite some time. finally, i look back and see a decent sized pick up rolling down the highway. i stick out my thumb, and they stop right away. the driver, Adolfo, helps me get my 50 kilo bike up into the back. the cute chica in the back seat opens the door and makes room for me. Adolfo's girlfriend in the front seat hands me a bud light. we try our best to communicate a conversation during the 7-8 minute trip. they are from a port town in sonora state. they drove there via mexicali. the back of the truck is filled with engine parts, which they are deliveringto ciudad constitution. i think Adolfo and his lady are staying there, while my companion in the back seat, who has never ridden a bike, is going to mazatlan. like everyone, they are amazed at my trip. Adolfo refuses some pesos when we get to mulege, and before they take off, his girlfriend hands me an ice cold gatorade. the people down here are awesome, truly. i walk to the bike shop, leave my bike there, behind the shop, while i make my way around town to try and locate the cheap camping till i decide what to do... i *NEED* new sealed bearings and at least one axle nut for a rear surly 'new hub'... in case anyone has any extra ones sitting around. at el candil, Dennis from yesterday fills me in on the free camping. i head out there, walking my bike. there are a bunch of places that charge for camping on the way out to the free camping. they all have ugly premises and a bunch of filthy dogs hanging around. a motorcycle tourist passes me with a wave. when i get to where the free camping is, i see him stopped talking to some locals. Steve is on a mostly offroad tour, with two other guys who he is ditching for the night for some peace and quiet. he is an unstoppable ball of energy, and you would never guess his age if you met him. he's had some amazing adventures. we chat for a while then i go set up my spot, a mere 10 ft from high tide. while sitting by my tent watching the sun go down, i spot a truck with kayaks and a bike that i recognized. he had passed me in the desert, with pumping fist cheering me on. it actually helped quite a bit, those little morale shots. i flag him down and chat. when he realizes who i am(remembers seeing me) he comes over to check out my setup, and we end up having dinner at el patrone, the restaurant on the beach. Josh is a cyclist/river rat from slaida colorado, so between cycling, and my interest(despite not owning one) in kayaking we had a ton to talk about. the music is a little loud during the night, but it's friday. the wind on the other hand, was something else. nearly blew my tent over.             "
28,"headed into town, but the internet cafe was closed. got some supplies from saul's tienda and headed back out to the beach. walked out around one of the points to spend some time checking out the gigantic aquarium they call the sea of cortez. all kinds of tropical fish, manta reys, starfish, hermit crabs. there were these pitch black crabs with bright blue and orange underbellies crawling on the rocks. crystal clear water. made some more rock totems. went swimming. watched the sun go down from the light house.             "
29,"internet cafe doesn't open till ten, so i walk back out to the beach for some oj at the restaurant. miguel, the patron and solo mariachi at night, is my waiter. he is learning english and is about as good at it as i am at spanish. we're gonna help each other learn while i'm here. head back into town to the internet cafe. on the way, run into the group camped out on the other end of the beach, next to the lighthouse. Ferron, George and his son, Crystal, her boyfriend and her father. they give me a ride into town as they are off on a day trip. George tells me to stop by later today to go out paddling.  at the internet cafe, i am at my computer for about ten minutes when in walks Norman, from santa rosalia. he spent the last two days down on bajia conception, and is on his way back north now.  Chris and Fred from Route 15 bicycles in Lake Hopatcong, NJ, the shop i worked at for three years are going to ship my parts down here.  Big thanks guys."
30,                more to come.....               
31,"met a kayak builder. have been kayaking twice. went on a half mile snorkel with some spring breakers camped out near me. saw some amazing corral reefs, all kinds of fish and manta/sting reys. met a lady from new york today. hung out for a little while, helped her build a little palapa. have gone on a few hikes.  it gets hot here in the day. i could only imagine in the middle of summer. i'm very tan.  i've decided to go to la purisima instead of loretto south from here. that means i will be crossing the sierra de la gigantica about 50 miles/1 day sooner. less hills, more flats, more culture. la purisima is a self sustaining oasis, much like san ignacio and mulege, only it's more remote, in the middle of the desert. from there it will be about 200+ miles of hot flat desert till i turn out down dirt roads to the pacific, and down to todos santos, the cabos, and more dirt roads to lapaz. i need to keep checking in at hotel cassitas on my package from the states. i have no idea when it will arrive. i've heard anything from three days to eight. i really hope its not eight. as much as i like this place, sitting still is not fun."
32,"i walked into town one day, my birthday actually, last week to check if my parts arrived yet. i walk into las cassitas hotel and look around, spotting the big UPS overnight envelope sitting on the office chair. when the woman who works there comes out, she hands me the package and refuses to accept money for being my mail drop off point. i accept the package, but my feelings on its arrival are mixed.  half of me was thrilled and excited that i would get to move on, but the other half hoped that it wouldn't show up for a few more days so that i would have more time with my friends.  i leave and sit down on the ledge outside the hotel to open it up. after getting through the series of three envelopes, i open the final one to look down and see the tools i need to install my new bearings, but not my bearings... i laughed. what else could i do. i called the bike shop, but chris, who was taking care of the transaction wasn't in yet. so i strolled back out to the beach and candice's house. we worked in the yard a little bit, then i called to find out for sure. turned out it was a matter of miscommunication. to many emails sent through a middle man, the wrong ones taken for necessary. could this mean two more weeks? candice's mother is coming down on the 12th. the shop wouldn't be able to get them to her on time i don't think. i call surly and talk to nick. he jumped at the opportunity to help me, and assured me the part would be shipped as fast as possible to candice's mom. the days went by, i ended up staying in candice's second bedroom, we watch dvd's every night. the first three friday the 13ths, grease. we had a full moon party on the 5th. we had a b-day party for me on the 6th. the core of the local group of people i've been hanging out with came and it was a great time. people come and go. we work on the yard. i went out on the river with alonso twice yesterday, to photograph the mating dance of the terns, a migratory bird that spends a significant amount of time here every year. every five to thirty minutes, a m ajority of them simultanaeously burst into the air and swiftly fly in a large circle or three. after which, the ones who were succesful in the mating dance, pair off and fly out over the sea to seal the deal. not unlike a senior prom. when i returned, candice informed me that her mom had not recieved the package yet. her flight leaves on monday. i probably wont get it, but that is not the end. i will head into town tomorrow and talk to some people who have friends coming down throughout the week. i'll have candice's brother ship it to one of them, or have them pick it up from him, and bring it down. it was very short notice, so i knew it would be close if they were able to get the part to her on time at all. at least now, i have a little more time to pursue my new interest(s). enjoy the dance a little bit longer.
"
33,          more to come...
34,"my bearings are in los angeles, at candice's brothers house. now i just need to find someone with a friend coming down, or who is making a trip up there. it shouldn't be too difficult.  there's this guy down here, ally, who is hiking baja for a few months. he's stranded here as well, although for much less time than me, with a muscle pull. he lives mostly off the land, and has shown me how to eat sea urchins, and is attempting to teach me to spearfish..."
35,"candice has started teaching me basic taiqi, some yoga stretches and qigong breathing excercises. to help my knee and my lungs, and so far, it seems to be doing the trick. we are also using healing clay treatments on my knee and to help clear up some of the scars on my shins, and acupuncture. all seems to be giving me alot more movemnt and strength in my left knee. we've taken road trips down along the bajia conception to lorreto. we helped our friends debbie and collete rescue, clean up, and find homes for 7 abandoned puppies. the two days that we had five of them at the house were quite possibly two of the most stressful days on the trip.  there have been plenty of dinner parties. a couple of birthday parties, going away parties. it's been a blast since i've been here. my creativity has skyrocketed. our current project is carving two big totems out of palm logs.  dave and valerie(and loverdog), christina and roy(and henry james and sisca) have left, as most of the gringoes do when the heat comes. candice plans to stick out the summer. it'll be interesting to see how she deals with the 120 degree heat and high humidity. she grew up in texas and the florida keys. the keys are at the same parallel, but are quite a bit more moderate during the summers.  i'll upload a bunch more photos later today..."
36,"                        for dinner one night, we had tofu, chard and guacamole on whole wheat tortillas. i realized after i had eaten two, that i had eaten tortillas with a yellow mold growing on them. early in the night, i started getting sleepy. then i started taking all sorts of long exposure pictures, intuitively. regular pictures almost hurt my eyes at that point. i laid down around 9:15, watched mommy dearest. the glands in my throat swelled slightly and were sore. then, after the movie, as i started to drift off to sleep, i had about an hour of rapid, intensely surreal, lucid dreaming. hallucinations if you ask me. candice insists it has more to do with the taiqi, accupuncture, brown rice diet and clay. i'm pretty sure it was the mold.... it was dreaming, but it was completely unlike any other dreaming i have ever remembered. such rapid relay of completely implausibe images. kind of like looking at my paintings.... perhaps it was just my subconscious stepping to the front.

39,                        
40,"we'll do this as a question and answer. Q: what made you decide to stay/stop the trip for now?  A: there are a number of reasons why i am waiting, and more keep sowing themselves every day. my living situation here is that i get to stay in my own room for free in exchange for landscape designing, labor, help and friendship. i have made some very good friends that i feel i should spend a little more time with right now. its a little too hot for a fair skinned irish american kid like myself to be travelling any closer to the sun. the rainy season is just starting in the jungles of south mexico. i started working on something that i would really like to see through to completion(or as near as anything man made can come to completion). everything has just kind of fallen into line for me to stay till late this year. besides, you saw the pictures, can you really blame me? Q: what do you plan to do when you leave? A: exactly the same as i had planned before. down baja, hitch a ride to the mainland, head down the pacific coast, around the yucatan, up the gulf coast and back to new york.new jersey. Q: do you have money saved up?/what will you do for money while you are there? A: my savings are running rather slim, but as Mom suggested in the guestbook, i will be attempting to sell my carvings. i will be concentrating for now on americana type pieces, like santa clauses, and will branch out from there. im currently carving samples for a potential client in the fashion industry(carved handles for custom handbags). we'll see how that turns out. i will be selling most of my work through http://www.SEANGRADY.com  there are a whole assortment of carved santas up there now, and different(non-sant) items will be appearing shortly. it's a good cause because it supports the rest of this trip. tell yourr friends. Q: you said one of the reasons you wouldn't go any further is because its too hot south of there, but isn't it going to be hot as hell in mulegé as well? A: yes, but i wont be riding in it. Q: how will we know what you're up to in between now and whenever you leave? A: a couple of ways. you can email and ask me. you can check http://www.SEANGRADY.com for news, i may put a little journal on there. you can check back here, as i plan to take some short weekend or weeklong trips while here to the abandoned missions up in the mountains or over to the pacific side. i will be sure to put journals up of those trips. Q: are you upset at all that the trip isn't continuing right along?  A: i was at first, but now im happy about it. Q: is there anyone you want to thank? A: OF COURSE!!!! the biggest thanks go out to my MOM, for all the help, support, and well wishes. every shooting star i saw while riding at night i dedicated to you mom, you were as much riding along with me to me as to you. thenext very important thanks is to NEIL GUNTON, without whom bikepacking would be a much more difficult activity to deal with for all of our moms, relatives and friends, and for simply providing this wonderful outlet free of charge. you kick ass Neil. ROUTE 15 BICYLE in lake hopatcong were a huge help, thank you chris and fred. Nick, Andy, Dave and everyone else in SURLYVILLE. i would also like to thank my dad, my two sisters siobhan and norah. siobhons husband mike and my nephew gavin.  i would also like to thank all the people who put me up and took care of me along the way, in chronological order:  Eric Roman/(iforgot)/pepper/mt nittany wheelworks in state college, pa; the caretaker of the campground at ryerson state park on the pa/wv border;  my aunt Anne and cousin Shiela in st louis, mo for all the food and hospitality; my cousin TJ Grady in iola, kansas for the same, and for being more then understanding about not meeting up that saturday night; Chris, Fred, and Mike from rt 15 bicycle again for putting me up in thier room from vegas, getting me into the show, and taking me out; Chris Mariano, my old friend from aiph for putting me up and hanging out in vegas with me(let's go yankees!); vegas is also where the help came in from my friend Nick Uniatwoski in manayunk, pa; Shane, Paul, Joel, soup, and everyone else in mesquite, nevada for all the help and friendship; the entire population of springdale, utah. especially timmy two socks and arrow, travis, ryan, amy, shea(?), sven, bill, jason, aaron, and everyone whose name i am unfortunately forgetting. the big house was a big part of this trip and you folks made so many amazing and beautiful experiences possible; david, from montreal, for the ride; NICK, DEL, SAL, DAVE and RHONDA in los angeles, ca for everything. nick, del and sal, you guys kick an exceptional amount of ass, and i hopefully will be able to visit you guys this summer; Stephen, Dana and Sean(and sarah, dels girlfriend/stephens sister who i met in LA) for putting me/us up for the night; BLM for not locking thier gates; tim, sebastian, joaquin, marshell, and the kids from cali at punta rosarito for the dinners, conversation, and incredible experiences; Dave, Valerie, loverdog, julia, Joan, Billie, Candice, chavez, Poncho, and everyone else in mulegé for putting me up and putting up with me. Ally for teaching me a whole lot of stuff. CANDICE gets a second one too, for all that she has done for me. helping to heal me, helping to heal my bike, offering me so much, with no expectations. thank you so much.  and a big THANK YOU to all my family, friends, fellow cyclists and those who were simply reading along with my trip.  Q: is there anyone in particular you would like to congratulate at this time??? A: OF COURSE!!! my very intelligent sister NORAH just graduated college! congratulations Norah. remember, i could ride across the country, but i couldn't finish even my associates degree. you worked hard and accomplished a goal and im very proud of you for that.

"
45,"by earnest After our departure with our dear trinitron at the wedding party,the rest of us walleyes stayed behind and had a entertaining evening of socializing with freindley folks around a campfire.The next morning we got up early and helped do some camp cleanup then we got on our bikes and had a great ride to dreamtime village where our next show was to take place.We received some assistance with transporting our gear from the wedding back to dreamtime by a very nice person named arrow.  Once we got back to dreamtime we met back up with Trinitron with much excitement and fervor.We spent our day at dreamtime relaxing and hanging out with Zan and all the nice resident's of the village.We did our show that evening to a small crowd of folks on the lawn.The show went very well and we all had a lot of fun.After the show we met a very nice lady named Angie who was very excited to talk to us.She was so cool, , she even biked to our show from La Farge!Angie told us that she works at organic valley, and that she thought that we could do a show there the next afternoon.When we heaerd about the possible show at organic valley,all of us walleyes were smiling toothy smiles!  The next morning we all woke up excited about performing at organic valley.so we got up early and biked to la farge to do the show.tThe rid there was smooth and easy until we reached town where i was told by aytayn that my bike had sprung a leak!I was little worried but it ended up being fine.Trinitron and walked the wouned bike through town until we reached organic valley. Once there we set up our show and perfromed for Angie and here co-workers and to our amazement some kids from a nearby daycare came over and saw our show too!after the show the folks at organic valley gave us lots of good organic treats! thanks organic valley!  After that we rode to readstown with Angie acompanying us for some of the way and along the way she showed us a really nice clean spring which we quenched our thirst at!We got to readstown where we stopped for the night.We met some local teens who were excited to meet us and told us about good places to camp.On the way to find a good campsite, we met up with a very nice little boy on a bike named tyler who became our freind and guide around readstown he led us to the kickapoo river but then it began to rain heavily so we decided to spend the night under a nearby gazebo near the little league field.While we were there we met another nice teenager named john who told us about his life and and family farm and also said that his family farmed for organic valley!We cooked a nice meal then set up our tent and went to sleep.it rained hard all night long.  We were woken up early by kids practicing baseball on the soggy ballfield.We got up and began our journey for gays mills.A couple of us walleyes got carried away in super biker mode and and biked farther than we were supposed to and took a longer route.Celeste and i acidentally took the long way and had to bike up a high ridge. I got kinda lost and had a dificult time.Finally while i was sad and despondent about my fate Jenka and deb from dancing waters permaculture farm appered in a car and told me i was on the right road after all!So they took all my gear for me back to dancing waters and gave me direction's.However i missed my turn again and went several miles too far and had to stop and ask a farmer where dancing waters was and then had to backtrack up a huge hill.but i finally did get there upoun my arrival i was given food and root-beer...  Wow life is really great i thought.So here we are guest's at dancing water's.It is really nice here this evening we are doing a show in gays mills at the co-op which should be a lot of fun. Well until the next wacky walleye tour update, were gonna cycle hard and have fun!
"
46,"gays mills is a great place!! the people were so welcoming and wonderful, Dancing Waters is a super place -- gardens and workshops and well-built homes in a sturdy community that's lasted over 22 years! and the coop is amazing -- because of the rain we had our show in the coop -- our best show yet! We stayed with a woman named laura who is working to challenge CAFTA -- the central american free trade agreement, which could be introduced as a bill to congress at any time -- it's already been signed by the resident-in-chief.  biking out of gays mills toward viroqua, we headed down some nice bendy country roads, with the horses munchin grass and the red-winged blackbirds swooping around us. we went over pine knob, and ate lunch in the grass by a lutheran church atop the knob. it was a really beautiful ride to viroqua, except the last few miles, which were on a crowded highway ..... roadkill and SUVs....yuck...I have been thinking about highways and bike circus lately -- when I'm on a bike tour with a bunch of people, I find myself constantly thinking about the group -- who's behind me, ahead of me, how they're riding, if they are having some problem, how to help lighten each other's load as best we can. and so we are in this kind of mobile community as we ride, with our radar feelers out for danger to our mates. but we are riding several feet away from these fast-moving vehicles that are usually occupied by a single driver (someone on the circus told me that 80% of the cars on the road in this country at any given time contain only one occupant, and that wouldn't surprise me if it were true) -- these cars bring out people's aggressive qualities, and are completely focused on self-gratification. the car gets you where you're going, quick and direct -- you don't have to think about anyone else but yourself, and in that way it serves to isolate us from each other, and make us more self-centered and speedy. it's weird sometimes to think how close these two worlds are passing each other each moment we're on the road, but how really far apart these realities are.  and just as we thought gays mills was the greatest place in southern wisconsin, we hit viroqua -- another community chock-full of great ideas and people. we just had two great shows in viroqua -- at the farmer's market (Check out the pictures) and at a party out in the countryside, at a house made of straw bales! we got to play with the rappin cowboy and ivan, while the crickets chirped all around us. well, maybe we'll write more after we get to lacrosse, but right now i'm too tired to fill in all the goofy details. the main, saddest news, is that we lost our ernie clown, because he is headed south to help stop the destruction of forests and wildland in appalachia, where he's from. check out more info on the camp at http://www.easternforestdefense.org/. He's gonna do some clownin around and get those trees saved in one of the last intact native ecosystems in virginia! go ernie!! we love you!  we got some new clowns too! wajid and his three-year old daughter laila! off we go!! to the mississippi watershed!!       "
47,"We leave southwest Wisconsin, for the first time all tour. We seemed to many people at more than one show as we had about 6 shows within a 40 mile radius. At the party on Saturday night, we played with Dave from Dreamtime and the Hogtown Stompers. He came up and sang the water song with us. We also got to see much of the Dreamtime crew the night before at the Coffee House benefit for Youth Initiative High School, where Zon, Claire and Diyanah go to school. We did the night club show and danced with Dave and our host, Jeremy, to the rock and roll tunes of Bees Stomping Grapes. Jeremy was the best. He took Ernie, Trinitron and Junka to an awsome swimin' hole, made us pizza, took care of all our basic needs and then some. Thanks Jeremy.  Raven, who runs a bike shop in Viroqua, gave us a killer route to La Crosse and we took off with the wind in our hair and a flourry of excitment...at 2 PM. Aytanathon switched bikes. The Tour De Resistance will stay with Jeremy in Viroqua and Aytan will continue on Swamyswam. Beautiful country roads over ridges and through valleys made for fine biking. We had a fine lunch and dip on a bike path.  We reached the Mississipi in time to see a freight train heading into La Crosse. Laila, Wajid and Trinity saved a box turtle from having to cross the train tracks. As we approached town, we noticed that Wajid's tire was going to have a blowout, and Trinitrons tires were falling apart, AND the trailer arm was going to snap in two! We made in to Cole's house without any breakdowns and collapsed after food, courtesy of pedal power and corporate excess. Thanks for the veggies Piggly Wiggly!  In the morning, and part of the afternoon, new tires we obtained, and Celester and A-tron spent three hours sort of fixing the wankified trailer at the corporate hardware store. We took of at 3 PM after much delay with repairs, and with a show at 7 at Wiscoy Valley Coop (30-40 miles away), we raced into Minnisota. As we climbed the Mississippi bluff, Mike and Cherie greeted us in a truck and took much weight off our bikes. Mike brought his bike and guided us to Wiscoy. We made it a bit before the sun set on the Valley and had just enough light to do our show to. Ivan Okay and Sandman, the rappin' cowboy, performed with us again, and so did Mike Bird, an acoustic punk rockstar from Winona. He brought in a huge, awsome crowd to compliment the Wiscoy crew and we had a great campfire with music and jokes:  ""Did you hear Willie Nelson got hit by a car? Yeah, he was playing on the road again!"" HA  The next morning, Ibrahim fixed the trailer. It's got a better hitch, and is much more aerodynamic. Thanks a lot.  In Winona, we hooked up with two new riders. And they both wear kilts! Andy is joining us at least to the Twin Cities, and Kilt Guy is leaving us here in Alma. He might be a bit sick from the cayenne pepper in the quinoa we ate last night. We're covering much more ground as we race towards the Twin Cities. The new trailer bin makes it easier to pack up in the morning. We got an early start today after camping out and a dip in the Mississip. We all enjoyed the playground in Buffalo City, and we found out what a good climber Laila is. ON TO MINNEAPOLIS!         "
48,"Taking off from Alma, we hit the most beautiful stretch of road yet (in my opinion)....we travelled along the 'great river road' that parallels the mississippi river on the wisconsin side. we saw heron, geese, turtles, ducks, hawks and even an eagle! (most of them were even alive, and not smushed on the road like so many of the animals we see). we got to ride in the rain for a while, through a wetland area -- water above and below us! perfect for the water tour.... and arrived, wet and miserable, in the little town of stockholm, wi -- we had a contact number there for a couple who we had been told would help us out in any way they could. as we stood in the pouring rain on the main street of stockholm, we soon discovered that this information we had been given was false -- not only would they not be able to help us out, but neither would anyone else in stockholm! cold, wet and hungry, we were directed to the city park, where we camped under the shelter (manger), for the re was no room for us at the inn....  but we awoke to much brighter skies, and took off into the sunshine to beautiful minneapolis....it was great riding, until we hit the 20 mph headwind that came straight at us, impeding our progress just a bit. we fought the wind like true warriors, and arrived, tired and happy (despite a slight confusing moment where we were separated from each other on the way to the minneapolis bike path), at the home of RAH in minneapolis. we ate breakfast at the historic delicious vegetarian seward cafe, and performed saturday night at the bedlam theatre to an appreciative, if somewhat non-expressive, minnesota audience.  on sunday afternoon we celebrated father's day with a family show in st. paul at the sibley bike depot (thanks andrew!), and got to ride around in a bike powered car! it's a super cool concept -- four riders, all pedalling, two in front, two in back, and one person doing the steering and shifting. some of the walleyes have been developing a design for a bike-powered circus caravan vehicle for future tours....  monday morning, we gained a clown! la-risky arrived in the early morn to our snoring, and performed with us that night! here's la-risky:  i'm not entirely sure what to say -- junka's recommended writing stuff from my personal journal, but mostly it's just silly little jokes to myself, not any sort of account of facts. (ie: Messy Jessy, her dreads in a frizzle, was not trying so hard, dreadful-dreadful.) But I got in on the greyhound monday morning early (5:45) and walked to rah's house once i made certain that, unlike me, my bike had absolutely positively NOT come on the bus. in the 2 days after i got myself out of that bus station and got to rah's house (covered with murals and beehive posters and old wallpaper ripped with beautiful painted house-skin and house-tissue under) i've had a crazy and excellent time. monday evening we did a show by the franklin bridge. unfortunately, it was trinitron's last show and i, suave infinite, managed to forget most of my freshly learned lines! in the evening, we had an awesome fire in the yard and approximately 1 million people invited themselves over. karen, rah's h ousemate, plays the accordion! but she unfortunately can't come with us until madeleine island. she and rah are the Angry Family -- they play songs like ""You Are My Sunshine"" in beautifully in minor keys and periodically break into moshpit-thrashing-style back and forth-hopping semi-metal.  Yesterday, we saw trinitron off on the bus with her bike in a box constructed almost entirely out of clear packaging tape. (A few cardboard panels for good measure were added) she's off to pick up a van that will run biodieselly around the country (or perhaps the whole subcontinent?) and we were sorry to see her go.  the food here is delicious, and, to use rah's word: ""bountiful"". i've become attached to people and the place remarkably quickly -- but we leave early this afternoon for Stillwater. so that's it for me....                             "
49,"i loved minneapolis...riverside bike trails, super duper dumpsters, bedlam theater, the greasepit bike shop, the bat annex free school, wacky folks all round helping and singing and riding with us in fine spirits. we ate for free, slept for free and met tons of people. thanks to the big city of da nort!  the night before we left, some of the crew went out to the dumpsters and came home with a giant load of travel booty...dried dates, dreied cherries, almonds, peaches, chocolate (!) and all kinds o food for hungry bikers...enough for the whole circus!  we left wednesday after a long day of packing and lazing about. we heaed out of town on a bike path that took us through nasty suburbs in ignorant bliss. the trail was peaceful and tree-covered, and every time we broke out into the road, i was happy we didnt have to negotiate the burbs face-2-face. we had hoped to ride to stillwater and hook up with the stragglers still camping on the black-label bike club ride to the river, but we were late and continued on the bike trail instead. as night fell, we found a lovely copse of aspen trees and set up camp on the grassy knoll. the biodiesel for the campstove must have been dirty cuz it was giving us lots o problems so we cooked a stew over wood fire and drank tequila till we all fell asleep by the embers.  next morning we said a temporary goodbye to junk-a and pedaled north on the bike trail...hooked up with hwy 95 and another bike trail (amazing!) making our way toward osceola on the wisco side. just as we were about to decend the valley to an unknown camp in a river town we saw a sign for fressh veggies and pulled in the gravel drive of Foxtail Farm to see what we could scare up. we were treated to one of the best nights yet...sympathetic farmers, great food, singin for our supper and another camp by a great fire. to top it all off, we met some super duper co-conspirators in almost every way. paul and chris have farmed the place for 15 years and run a tight operation serving some 150 folks organic food in the twin cities. they also make their own biodiesel from used grease and have built a composting pooper in their silo! we were in the perfect place! they cooked us a twilight stir fry and big meal while we set up for an impromptu show...the first since we lost junka and trinitron :( we laughed at ourselves a lot and they cheered us on with beer and good food to finish it all off.  then this morning, paul helped me filter our cruddy biodiesel for da stove and gave us another quart from their barrel while their interns and co-workers cooked us oatmeal and made us tea. tey were alll dreamy and i wanna go back! thanks Foxtail Farm!  Now we're about to hook up with a long packeed gravel trail called the Gandy Dancer trail that heads due north to Superior wisco. Tonight we hope to be in Luck for another spur-o-the-moment circus show to practice our new parts and have more clowny fun! It has been truly heartening to meet kindred solk and such good people in minnesota...               "
50,"back in minnesota. swervin in and out around different watersheds and along beautiful rivers. but just a few days ago we were rinding along the Gandy Dancer Trail.  Riding side by side(kind-of). just before we got to Luck,Wisconsin Salamander found a black cub who looked as if she had been hit by a car and fell asleep on the side of the bike trail. we sprinkled tobacco on her and made a merit. there is so many sad road kill stories we have come across on our long journey. we made it to Luck,Wisconsin. cylester got a flat. and Rah held the Luck Alternative Food Co-op open for us to pick up the night necessities we needed e.g. chocolate, greens, chips, salsa, fig newmans. then we snacked and waited for the rest of the gang to arrive. Ayton went to a super market and scored a crate full of green beans and onions. yeah. we were happy little campers.  it rained all night.and shone in the morning,a cheerful accomplice for our short parade out of Luck .but our luck continued  at the Wren Cafe where we all imbibed of the much talkd about coffee and fresh bread.our planned short stop turned into a plan for an impromptu show!!!!!flyers were colorfully drawn,new scenes added,and faces painted for our evening show.our small and appreciative audience giggled and sang with us into nightfall and a flute accompanied fire show from rah and salamandy sent us on our way...back on the gandy!!!an all nite tribe ride on another cold  and clear evenin  sent clowns digging for sock mittens and into the costume bag for added warmth.we had a legendary stop for food refueling  and  warm-up jumping janes and foot kicks and celester outwitting her attempts to warm up by peeing in her shorts with unstoppable laughs.it was quite a sight.and so much to see along the way,a peesfull ride on the whipporwill  and owl singing and wolf howling trail to a bridge only nine miles from our projected rest stop. we all parked our bikes and watched the river mist rolling in .captivated and cheeks flushed and laugh muscles sore we couldnt help but lay out our sleeping bags and let the spirit of the place lift us into mistee dreemin'.(except for salamandy and jeedy and rah who helped lighten the teqilla load around a game of hot dice)rain and jeedy got us back on the trail and tired tired tired we rolled into danbury and the inside out cafe.broken spoke issues kept wajid awake in search of a new wheel  while the rest of the clowns pitched a tent in the back of the cafe for some much needed rest.wheel found ,a note left,""danbury saves da day""and a split up crew sez farewell to the gandy, hello highway, for a short ride to our evenin camp. the next day found more broken spokes and a farewell to ayton and rah hitchin to superior for trailer and bike repair.sans rah and ayton we all met up by early evening for a soul feeding illegal swim in the manitou falls.just the thing for a bunch of sore and weary walleyes.rootbeer falls swirling around volcanic rock wetted our water loving butts and bellys.we went to sleep refreshed and ready for the next days downhill ride into superior and a grand reunion with jenka rah and ayton.our day started a little early with a dork noodlin park ranger ready to haul all of us into the sheriffs(including sleeping smaila)for illegal camping.intent on teaching us all the way of the law,(particularly important post 9-11) dork noodle cheerfully and with the solemn seeriousness of a hallway monitor,took all our names and forwarded them to the proper authorities.content that we were now in the system and wernt gunna git too far on our food and sparkle laden bikes,he sent us down the road  with a warning.too bad he didnt join us on our ride into superior where we all leapingly reunited and eagerly set out for superior.its gettin on time to go now so ill follow up withe tale of superior next chance we get.the last hundred miles lay before us as the day churns forward.food trailer replenished,new friends made,and songs in our hearts we bike forward.       "
51,"Aytan & Rah got 3 rides into Doolooth, got the new wheel for swamy swam, and treats from the Whole Foods Cooperative. Sitting outside the coop eating, they met Chad, Kristen and 9 month old Forestasia, who invited them to their artist commune for sleeping. And sleep they did. The next morning, Aytanandon headed to Superior, to the library, and found Junka sittin' in front playing guitar. Back from the wedding and riding on silly McGillicutty, it was a joyous reunion, and the rest of the Walleyes soon came ridin' down 35. We did a show that night at Leif Ericson park, and another at a punk house on the west end of town. The trailer got fixed the next day at Jeff and Sarah's great metal forging studio farm house, and aytan forged a spoon fer hisself out of a metal rod!  rah and cylester took off early in a mad rush to pirate island, while everyone else stayed over at the house of metal forgery well, the child came down with a fever that night, and we all worried about her 103 degree heat....but laila smila was bouncing back the next morning, and ready to ride to the island!  everyone piled onto the bikes and set out for bayfield.....    when we got to a detour in the road, we scratched our heads and wondered, 'should we go ten miles out of our way, or try to ford the rivers where the two bridges are out'......two local bikers came along, and gave us the advice that we should go ahead and ford the rivers!  so off we went, into a headwind, late afternoon of july 1 with the sun beginning to turn purplish on the horizon.  we got to a beautiful spot looking over lake superior, and larisky ran down for a quick dip in the frigid fresh waters of the biggest lake in north america......meanwhile salamandy scouted out the road ahead, where the bridge was out, and came back to report 'well, this is going to be......fun......'      we built a little bridge with rocks and carried the bikes and trailers one by one over the muddy, wet culvert.....our toilet paper roll fell in the water, but that was the only casualty of the crossing.        the second river was easier, because we were able to wheel the bikes across a kind of balance beam that the construction workers had so thoughtfully left stretched across the river.  and finally, as the sun was going down, we rolled into the town of port wing, stopping at the bar to get beers for salamandy's birthday party!  silly mcgillicuddy broke a chain, but luckily it was right across from a metal scrapyard when it happened, so junk-a and aytananan searched the surreal piles of junk metal, cars, refrigerators, stoves that reached up and up to the sky, and found a bike with chain that was removed and put onto mcgillicuddy as the last moments of sunlight sank down into the night..... and a full moon, which rose behind scrap metal and up above the superior lake, to enchant our gypsy camp with its warm glow.....we cooked over the campfire in a perfect little grove of trees just above the beach....and were joined by missy the kayaking camper, who gave us apples and gatorade, and sang songs by guitar until late in the night.... then we biked to madeline island, arriving just in the middle of the pirate cabaret on friday evening july 2.  reunited with rah and cylester, we prepared for the big pirate pageant on sunday the 4th.  with much debauchery and rowdiness in tom's burned down cafe each night, the pirates managed to take over madeline island on the 4th, thus re-claiming 'independence day' for TRUE independence, independence from all rulers, nations and authorities....we declared the island to be a temporary autonomous zone, and kidnapped key and prominent community leaders as prisoners on the pirate ship, until they were rescued by rival pirates..... it was an amazing pageant, with about 50 pirated buccaneers, and a couple dozen kids all dressed up in costume and getting into the act......a crew of musicians filled the air with gaiety, and the massive pirate ship, built entirely out of cardboard and paper mache, was mounted on a flatbed pulled by a team of horses all around the town, with pirates raising hell during the 4th of july parade.      we did a show that evening in the live art circus tent, with about 100 people watching (lots of pirates), who cheered for the poop puppets in their pirate ship in the sewer system.    then the walleyes started dropping off like crazy.....first cylester, then larisky, rah, then swervy mcgervy, wajeedeater and smaila, and now salamandy.... leaving junk-a and aytan to recruit here in ashland for the second leg of the trip..... onward we go!! to green bay!! and sheboygan!! waukesha!!  and milwaukee!!  we are biking to lake michigan and beyond.....new skits are emerging from the woodwork to enter our show.......care to come along?       "
52,"well, when we left ashland we were down to three hardy walleye wheelers.... joined by the great and mighty allison and her bike barrett the night we left (the 9th), we sure didn't make it far!! as the sun was going down, we headed out of town, but got distracted by promises of a fire circle and story-telling at northland college south of town....so we biked into the campus, and camped down a path beyond the soccer field -- we were told the path was bikeable, but soon found that ATVs (all-terrain vehicles) had taken it over and created huge ruts and ponds full of water that we, on our laden-down bikes, could not possibly traverse.  but we managed to haul our stuff over to the campsite next to the northland college ravine, and wined and dined on gourmet vegan natural grains and veggies as usual......waking in the morning to a long hot ride south on highway thirteen. too much traffic on thirteen, but we rode all day and made it to a little town called glidden, where there was a big sign announcing 'FREE CAMPING' -- wow!!  so we headed to the town park for the free camping, and found ourselves face to face with a HUGE TANK!  well, many people probably have seen this in their own travels, but still, it's a little disconcerting to see how many of these small midwestern towns have been invaded with old WWII tanks that sit proudly in town parks across this area.  the one in glidden was especially large, and protected us while we slept in the mosquito-infested ATV route that was the town park, with several pickups full of young men eyeing us as they crept along by our campsite several times in the night.  but we left town without a hitch in the AM, but not without viewing the huge stuffed bear that is the town's mascot, and meeting the local mechanic sitting in the 'hometown cafe', who walked over to his shop and got a wrench that could tighten my loose front fork.... as we rode along towards butternut, SNAP!! allison's spoke broke!  easy to fix??  well, not without a cassette remover and chain whip, as it was on the rear wheel.  lucky for us, it happened just as we were passing a yard sale that advertised 'bikes', and turned out to be the residence of THOR, the norse thunder-god, complete with massive hammer!  I mean, this guy had to be eight feet tall, and LARGE....and his two sons who wore overalls and followed his orders.... but he had about a hundred bikes piled up in his yard -- so we went through and found a wheel that (sort of) fit on the bike, listened a bit to Thor telling us how he had to get rid of the internet because one day he found his boys trying to type in 'naked ladies . com', and the one was asking the other how to spell it, and well, he just about threw a fit, and said no more internet!  he was really nice though, and gave us the wheel for free, and said he's trying to start a bike shop with a lodge for touring bikers to stay at, and have a shower and a rest!!  how cool is that??  so if you're biking on thirteen between glidden and butternut, make sure you look for the norse god's secret hideout in central wis... when we got onto 70, we entered the chequamagon-nicollet national forest, and had a wide shoulder with little traffic as the sun set at our backs, casting its pink glow on the white birch trees all around. we camped that night (the tenth) along one of wisconsin's thousands of lakes, called round lake, the site of the only surviving logging dam from the 1880s.  our campsite was right next to the logging dam, and we woke early (6 am!) to avoid any confrontation with freddies (forest service cops).....sleeping on pine needles with the rush of water lulling us to bed, it was hard to imagine the extreme force and brutal logging operations that ripped through this area (and all of wisconsin) less than 150 years ago......in 1850 this area was all old-growth forest.......ojibwe, chippewa indians lived here, fishing out of birch-bark canoes and navigating along the intricate river/lake highways that connected all of northern wisconsin.  and then the europeans came, ripping out ALL the old growth within TWENTY years to build the cities of the east and the midwest.  and in 1872, the huge fires raged through the ravaged land, killing hundreds......the burned out wasteland became farmland, and now, though the forest is re-growing in some places, it is young and extremely unhealthy......could use a good burn.......but humans won't let that happen... all that aside, we got back onto 70 the morning of the 11th only to discover that the shoulder had disappeared and the traffic had increased DRAMATICALLY!  what is it about huge SUVs with american flags that makes so many of them try to run us off the road?  is it some kind of pro-america thing to run bikers off the road??  I don't understand!  but virtually every vehicle that passed was an SUV or pickup, many hauling boats or ATVS in trailers for their vacational recreation. we caught up with many of these vacationers that night, when we tried to perform our show during the intermission of the 'minaquabats' water-skiing larger-than-life water show in minocqua.  we didn't really get many people to watch, and those that did seemed disgusted by our 'poopets'....or maybe just didn't want to hear about water issues while on vacation (a vacation that, in this area, generally includes some obscene display of muscle-powering huge gas-powered boats around polluted lakes and driving through forests on gas-powered ATVs).....camped that night at my relative's house in woodruff, and got to commisserate about the sad state of affairs in U.S. foreign policy... we also got bikes fixed at 'Zee Best' bike shop in minocqua, where the cuban ex-pat who ran the place argued politics and overcharged the wet and soggy walleyes, and also told us we smelled......hmmm. then headed off on the bearskin bike trail, a former railroad bed that was too gorgeous and nice to be true (especially after battling the SUVs the day before).....after six miles, we discovered that, yes, it WAS too good to be true, as we were kicked off the trail by a stern-looking park ranger who demanded our park fee, and when we didn't produce it told us 'go to the highway!' -- which we reluctantly did, but the highway was fast and furious, full of death machines (ie. cars and trucks), so we took the next road back to the trail and, ranger be damned, got back on the trail -- we weren't gonna go for his 'your money or your life!' type of logic....we decided to save our lives and ride on the bike trail instead. when we got to tomahawk, we stayed at the amazing pristine farmhouse of jim and pam wise, who have turned an old dairy farm into a restored wetland, with passive solar on their home and much fresh garlic in their garden!  jim was instrumental in the fight against the crandon mine (check out http://www.nocrandonmine.com/ for more info on this struggle), a fight which was eventually WON a couple of years ago with the help of the Ojibwe Indians in the area. the audiences at the two shows at the library this morning (the 13th) were not quite so welcoming and recpetive to our message as pam and jim, however.  after the first show, the library received complaints that we had 'used the word god in a profane way (ie. oh god, that's disgusting), used the words 'damn' and 'sucks', and had encouraged people to pee outside and not use the toilet, and after all, these parents are trying to potty train their kids, and this IS the city after all....people CAN use toilets.......'........right... so we were literally asked to 'clean up our act' which is kind of hard to do, when your show's about sewage, pollution and poop.....but we did the second show without incident and (apparently) without much offense to any of the audience members..... although i don't think we'll be asked back to the library in tomahawk...... anyway, jim and pam are great, and we're splitting up to meet again in green bay on friday (the 16th) then down to manitowoc (the 18th) and sheboygan (the 20th) then waukesha and milwakee and madison! onward!
"
53,"smooth country roads and the smell of fresh manure greeted us, and we met a nice woman named martine from quebec who is biking from the west to the east coast of the US.......72 miles a day, all loaded down with stuff (makes our 30 mile days seem kind of wimpy in comparison)..... country roads are always nice, but it's pretty bizarre how much mowing of lawns takes place in the countryside of the US.....huge plots of land are razed over by these gas-guzzling machines -- is it any wonder that mowers are second only to cars in their abuse of oil? when it got to be about dusk, a nice guy in a vw van stopped and said we could camp at his friend's house, a few miles down the road.  so we went down to camp there, and found they lived right next to a fancy dinner theatre, out in the middle of the countryside!  we had a bonfire, and roasted vegan marshmallows that pam gave us......then woke bright and early to the sound of wild turkeys and dogs barking to bike the last few miles into manitowoc.  now we're at the culture cafe, a haven of sanity in the midst of midwestern patriotic lunacy, getting ready to do our show at 1......"
54,"we had a great show in manitowoc, with about 20 people including lots of families with kids.  we performed in the parking lot outside the culture cafe, and FINALLY a somewhat appreciative audience.....we performed the rap about the town of waukesha and their water-wasting habits, and all the standards from our earlier shows: the poopet show, a puppet show where the turds discover the truth about toilets: that they waste water and mix organic waste with toxic heavy metals in the sewer system -- so the turds escape and decide to get composted in a humanure toilet instead; the song and news report about sewage dumping in the great lakes (brought to you by bernie and bertie, the loud mouth bass singers); the song about ""CARS!"" that gives a brief history of the automobile and its effects; a skit that used to be part of our skit series ""The Evolution of Water"", which illustrates the process by which water went from free flowing, natural springs and rivers to aqueducts to pipelines and sewer systems of today......we also performed a little song about roadkill, in which our friend tom the toad gets squished by a car....... well, those are some of the highlights from the show we've been performing all over the state for the last seven weeks.....our show in manitowoc was at the culture cafe, a great place run by richie.... after the show we headed over to the acoustic festival going on in manitowoc, and saw some melodious harmonica-tootin by lil' rev, and junk-a got to perform some irish step dancing.... all in all, a great stay in manitowoc, and we began our bike ride toward milwaukee monday morn (the 19th) -- we passed the natural ovens factory, but there was no way in to ask for leftovers!  but we saw where the natural ovens bread is made: in a big factory, with a model farm and zen garden next door.  as we were riding down lakeshore drive along lake michigan, we saw ahead in the distance a watertower, that signalled we may be approaching a town....as we got closer, however, we realized that the watertower said ""Kohler"", and towered over a MASSIVE factory that makes -- you guessed it -- FLUSH TOILETS! Aaaaaah!!!!  I guess it is appropriate, with all our focus on toilet issues in our show, that we should ride right by this plant (not to mention the time we spent in Green Bay, which produces so much of the nation's toilet paper that some residents have taken to calling it 'the ass-wipe capital of the world'.) passing up the kohler plant, we began to notice the pavement was recently paved over in this area north of sheboygan, and there were big green temporary fences on either side of the road blocking the view of factory farming from the road......we soon figured out why this was when we got to the golf course, where huge tents were set up and hundreds of staff and maintenace people were preparing the place to be perfectly manicured for the Professional Golf Association, which will be playing here the week of August 9th........so for that brief moment in time, everything in the area will sparkle and shine, the roads will be well-paved, so that the super-elite of the PGA won't have to see a drop of poverty, suffering or pollution in their perfectly manicured dream world.  strange how much work and months of preparation go into the planning of just a few days of visiting by the super-elite..... in sheboygan, we visited indian mounds, some of the only surviving mounds (white settlers to the area destroyed the vast majority of the mounds both in wisconsin and nationally).  they were built around 500 AD, but nothing is really known about the builders.....apparently the mounds were in the shapes of deer and jaguar, but due to their 1500 years of degradation and my untrained eye, i couldn't really see the resemblance..... as we rode south, we noticed a sign that said ""View with alarm/ The factory farm / C-Cares"", and went to the door to ask what it was all about.  we met george howard, who told us all about the four year struggle they've been having with a local agri-business farm factory operator who wants to increase his cattle herd from 3500 to 9000 cattle, despite the massive pollution and runoff his farm is ALREADY causing to local streams both to the north and south.  the local residents formed a coalition group called Centerville Cares (C-Cares), and they have a lawsuit going now, with the help of Midwest Environmental Advocates.  The water they drink, and all the properties that border the lakes, are affected by the runoff, as there is a huge algae bloom all along the coastline due to the cow manure -- each cow produces 35 pounds of manure a day -- multiply that by 9000, and THAT by 365 days a year, and you have a BIG pile of SHIT to deal with..... so we discovered yet another local struggle against the profit seekers that would poison us all for their own personal gain..... a common theme on this trip, as we found people all over the state fighting these same david vs. goliath type battles (and sometimes even winning, like in the case of the crandon mine in tomahawk) south of sheboygan county we discovered the inter-urban bike trail!  a paved path along the railroad line that begins on county K just west of LL at the Ozaukee County Line.  wow!!!  finally, after 7 weeks, we discovered our bike-topia......with raspberry bushes on the sides!  yeah!!  and we made it through port washington, where we were told (for the second time this trip) that we had 'pimpin rides' ...... and finally ended up at a friend's house near cedarburg (a 60 mile day!), where we feasted on vegan fudge and stir-fry, and watched a new movie about the propaganda machine that calls itself 'fox news' (the movie is called ""outfoxed"", and is a documentary by the folks at moveon.org's fox news campaign ) the morning of the 20th, we took off through the neighborhoods of massive estate homes that border milwaukee on the north side....yuck. but we got into the city, reunited with celester, and tried to perform today at a city park -- until we were rained on by a sudden storm that completely drowned us out and made the kids run for cover..... we'll try another show tonight at a punk event....then......who knows?  will the cycle circus end here?? or continue in increasing ever-expanding ripples of mind-boggling entertainment and death-defying feats of wack wonder?????  only zoron knows......."
55,"   Here we go again.  I had planned to leave on this tour around Lake Michigan today, after work.  But I got visited by my son and granddaughter from Wisconsin, the chance of rain is 85% for tomorrow, and I had to replace the rear wheel on Rocinante, my bicycle.  So right now is looks like I may leave Monday, 5th.  By that time the son will be gone, the rain may be gone, and the campgrounds should be emptied from the holiday. I'm going along, self-supporting, camping, but not cooking. Generally, up along the west coast of the Lake, to Sheboygan to visit friends, then north to Manitowac, to take the ferry across the lake to Ludington, MI.  North again on the east side, to Traverse City to visit another friend.  More north to Macinaw Island to two ferries to get across the straights.  Then into the Upper Peninsula of Michigan, keeping the lake always on my left until about Green Bay or so.  Then heading west (right through the hills of the upper Kettle Morraine area!) towards Wisconsin Dells to visit same son and granddaughter. It's a three-day trip back to Chicago, and I'd like to get home for the Friday, 7/30 Critical Mass ride in Chicago. I haven't packed yet, only started, so I have a couple more days to forget things in.  Always happens, right? I'll try and keep this up to date, but past experience in Louisiana says that I'll probably be accumulating several days of material before I stumble across a library, school, or internet cafe.  Pictures will be posted on Webshots; if I don't post a link you can go there and just look up my name.  I'll probably wait until I get home to do a final edit and add pictures to the 'blog.   Wish me luck - and I haven't even started yet!
"
56,
57,"  I left around 7 AM, made it to Kenosha,a WI around 12:45pm, 45 miles.  (Is that all it is?) Odometer must have gotten wet, and all of the digits aren't displaying correctly, so this may be a problem the rest of the trip. In Kenosha, going just up the street from where the bike trail ends, is a great bike shop.  Total Bikes, Total Bicycles, something like that.  Lot of jumping in my rear derailleur and the quickly adjusted it for me.    Somehow, I got lost and away from Rt. 32, the car highway to Milwaukee.  I went around the west side of Racine then back east to the lake and highway 32.  Someplace south of Milwaukee I stopped in a tavern for a light dinner ($2 double cheesburger!) and was given suggestions for a cheap motel: go west, way west, to the other side of the airport, 27th street. Found a cheap motel.    But it had cable, and I watched some of the 2nd stage of the Tour D' France.  I noticed that during the time it took me to take a shower, those guys travelled further than I did during a hour during the day!  I guess I don't have to worry about every qualifying. :( Average speed, 9.8 mph, travelled for 12 hours but only rode for about 8.5. Lotta rest stops. Added note, discovered on the way home: WGTD-FM, the NPR station in Kenosha has an excellent page listing the paths/routes between Chicago and Milwaukee.  It's at http://www.wgtd.org/trailhome.htm"
58,"  Back east (again), picked up Rt. 32 and made it to Brown Dear Road around noon.  Took this west, and had to hunt around for a short bike path to County Line Road and the start of the Ozaukee County Trail.  (Gotta check that spelling, I don't have the map with me)  Ozaukee County has a GREAT trail! Paved, the entire length of the county.  A few places were you follow streets and roads, but not many.  It seemed as if the rolling restance on the pavement was very low.  I think the whole thing is about 30 miles long.  An old interurban railway trail. Lots of civilization along the way, as well out country riding.   Information about this trail at http://www.interurbantrail.us/Index2.htm (Thanks to John Carr and his note in the Guestbook for that link) At the end, took a couple of roads north to Sheboygan, to stay with friends, Jane and Ed Mueller who have a place just south of Sheboygan, near the Kohler Andre State park.  Since I got there late, 8 PM or so, I decided to stay an extra day and head out early on Thursday.  Manitowac, and the ferry, is only about 35 miles north but it leave at 1pm.   Great spending time vising anyway, and I don't think I had been up to their summer cottage in almost 15 years.
"
59,"    The plan is to ride to Manitowoc, catch the ferry around 1 PM.  It's a four hour trip to Ludington, but then I'll be on Eastern Time and probably thoroughly confused for the whole time!
"
60,"Good thing I left early: arrived about 11:30, and they said they started loading the boat around noon, and put the bikes on motorcycles on first and then loaded the passengers all about a hour early.    So I had no problem and only a short time waiting.  They had dogs sniffing the baggage, looking for weapons.  I had the pepper spray which I had to pack in one of the bags and leave it on the bike.  I took the sleeping bag roll, along with the camera and a book onto the ship.  Good idea: I took about a two-hour nap on a deck chair, quite comfortable.  It was very cool, but the sleeping bag was warm.  Lunch on the boat, and we arrived in Ludington around 5:15 Central time, on time.    From now on, I gotta remember:      THE LAKE IS ON MY LEFT       MY CLOCK IS ONE HOUR BEHIND. Luddington is nice, but the places to stay all looked expensive.  I took a side road (ended up on Fountain Road) some distance, to avoid Rt. 31 but eventually I joined it, where I got a ham sandwich and chocolate milk.  (I seem to be drinking a lot of chocolate milk on this trip.)  Anyway, it was starting to get dark (and cloudy) and about 15-20 miles to Manistee.  But an older gentleman at the grocery store suggested a place with cabins, just past the Sauble River.  It worked, and the cabin was reasonable.  (I'll add some pictures later, I hope.) Nice restuarant at the cabins, too bad about the ham sandwich earlier.    The mileage today was lower than normal, but that's because of the four-hour boat ride, which is to be expected.   Some headwind again, but no rain and it was cool.
"
61,"Rose around 6 AM, and straight off.  Good breakfast in Manistee, in the downtown historic district.  Rt. 31 runs through Manistee, but downtown is really along the Manistee River, to the west of the highway.  I'm glad I took the turn to look around.     Along the way, I stopped to talk to a hitchhiker, who was walking/hitching looking to get to Traverse City also!  There's a big Cherry Festival going on there right now. It's about Noon, and I'm in the Bear Lake public library. Continued: made it, but all the motel rooms were taken, with the Cherry Festival.  Camped out in the Interlochen Campground, (http://www.michigandnr.com/parksandtrails/ParksandTrailsInfo.asp?id=460) nice, right on the lake, classical music concert in progress just up the shore.  I took a ride over, but it was too late.    I had intended to visit with a young friend of mine, Elliot, up in Traverse City for the summer.  Nuts, I was about two days early (he was at a two week seminar at Notre Dame) and I didn't want to hang around Traverse City for two days.  In retrospect, I could have. Several off-road paths, leading into Traverse City from the south, and leading out of Traverse City to the north.  Except during Cherry Festival time, I don't think the traffic would have been as heavy, so no real need to take them.  I like exploring the urban areas anyway, so I like the paths between cities, but not necessarily through the cities.
"
62,"A bike path I stumbled across following 31 north.  After the Cherry Festival area, there were signs to a bike path that got me off of 31 for a while. It ran right back into Rt. 31, so no danger of getting lost.    Charlevoice: the big Rabbit Rescue operation!  Along the banks of the canal connecting the inner lake to Lake Michigan, a rabbit was running back and forth, lost.  A dog scared it, and it jumped into the canal.  (I didn't know rabbits could swim!).  Anyway, everybody along shore hollerin', and a passing boater jumped in with a bucket.  Had a hard time getting the rabbit.  Finally, it got it, and passed it up to someone on shore, who put the rabbit in the grass in the sun - all wet, of course.  Rabbit just sat there for quite a while, probably in shock.  I left.    North of Charlevoix, a bike path almost all the way to Petoskey.  Really nice, off-road.  Ended just short of the main part of the city - but picked up again late. Low-light of the trip: it was getting dark, and the only motel I saw was a Super 8.  I asked how much, was told $99.  I asked where the campground was.  I was given some confusing directions, through town, the way you would drive a car there.  Price got dropped to $89 so I bit the bullet and took it.  Nuts.  At least free coffee, rolls, fruit, and waffles for breakfast, which I took advantage of.  Even grabbed a couple of apples for the trip. The next morning, I got on the bike path - it was 1.3 miles to the campground, and the bike path led right to it.  Almost a whole yard shot, staying in a Super 8 which I didn't need. Oddity along the way: many shops selling bait advertised ""Canadian Nightcrawlers.""  I couldn't help but wondering, so I asked at one gas station.  The attendant didn't know the difference, wondered if the nightcrawlers spoke French to the fish!  Spent some time riding and dwelling on this.  How can you tell the difference, if you bought some?  Is there a difference between Canadian and American nightcrawlers?  How does this affect the US balance of payments in the import/export financial market?  Does NAFTA speak to the subject of nightcrawlers?   Lots of time to ponder and think on a bike trip! Maybe too much.
"
63,"  Found a bike path, went by the airport.  At a picnic bench, I found a Skydivers Handbook.  Good shape, so I turned it into the office.  Kinda fun riding a bike down the airplane taxiway.  You do find things along the road when your bike riding. At 10:50 Eastern Time, I stumbled across a church.  Long mass, though.  Franciscans, I think.  Had a baptism going, lots of stuff for the kids, and I arrived just in time.  Put on the long ""dress"" pants I brought just for this occassion.      The bike path had taken me to Rt. 119, which I intended to take anyway.  Famous for the ""Tunnel of Trees"" and it is like a tunnel right along the lake. However, it was a narrow road, no shoulder, and no centerline marking.  Some hills involved, including one or two I had to walk up.      At the end, Legs Inn, an authentic Polish restuarant.  Great food.  I had Kapusta and Kielbasa.  Instead of taking the road directly back to Rt. 31 I stayed on the 'scenic route' which wasn't very well marked once you took off.  Stumbled around a few roads and finally made it back. Rt. 31 ended where it entered I-75.  I didn't see any ""no-bike"" signs, and I did look, so I road the shoulder until a convenient off-ramp.  This led me to an information area which was closed, but I perused the map and followed the road to Rt. 23 going south.  Opted for a very nice motel which was only 37 bucks (I was still hurting from the Super 8 incident!) Mackinac Motor Lodge and Resort, just about the last motel heading south going out of town.  Archie and Donna Falor (click to show email) ran the place, very nice people.  They had cabins down on the beach, but a traditional motel up closer to the road which was cheaper.  Sunday bonus: rode back to the downtown area and there was an outdoor concert at the pavillion, the US Air Force Band.  Good, but it was dark by the time I left.      Dark means darn near 10:00 PM Eastern Time.  Being north of the 45th parallel really makes a difference.
"
64,"The motel, which was less than $40 to begin with, included a discount coupon for a couple of bucks off breakfast at the Admiral's Table.  So I had the buffet, which I thought would last the whole day. Heading towards the dock, a nice truck driver stopped and waited for me to cross in front of him.  It would have been faster if he had gone ahead, so I hurried to get by, so as to not hold him up.  I mounted the bike - and fell on my -- knee.  So much for hurring up.  No serious injury, but a scraped knew which I knew was gonna make camping and kneeling painful. Left on the ferry about 10 ET, $23.50 round trip for me and the bike. Round trip meaning I would depart for St. Ignace, not return to Mackinaw City.  Putzed around the island a good deal of the day.  Crowded with bikes.  Several times I couldn't find a parking spot in the downtown area! I rode the 8 miles path around the island, eventually I went uphill to the Grand Hotel (no bikes in front) and then wandered around - and got lost!  The paved road turned into a paved path which turned into a gravel path which turned into a golf course path!  Whew!  Finally, I found a sign which said ""no golf carts beyond this point"" and I figured that mean a way out of the tangle of paths.  I got led to a steep, gravel, downhill path that came out on the opposite side of the island at around the 5-mile marker.  Ate a brat at an outdoor cookout, did a rubbing at the church, bought some fudge (which I consumed over the next few days).  Got a chocolate malt for $5.50, which I thought was a little expensive. I don't know what time I left the island, but it was an easy ride through St. Ignace to find US 2 westbound.  A very good road, though the whole upper peninsula.  Wide shoulder.  The first few miles had some hills but after that is was pretty flat.  It started out as a wide 4-lane highway with an 8' shoulder, but narrowed down eventually to a 2-lane highway with at least a 3'4' shoulder. Ideal for riding and it followed the shoreline.  I considered guerrila camping in a couple of spots, but it was too early.  Too early by sun-time although it was late by the clock.  Funny how late the sun stays out as you get to the higher latitudes.  In particular, there were rest areas around the Cut River Bridge that would have been good to camp at.  There were state parks, but they were crowded with behemoth campers.  Not much fun setting up a tent amongst them, and only slightly cheaper than a motel, by comparison.    Had some meat loaf lunch in Brevort. Slightly past the Cut River was Epoufette, a very small place with a motel set up on the hill and overlooking Lake Michigan.  Honor System check in: several keys with cards.  Take your pick and sign in.  I was hoping the owners would return before I went to bed so I could settle up in case I wanted to leave early.  No luck, so I slept late, ate at the restuarant next door in the morning and settled up then.
"
65,"NPR played Groffe's ""Sunrise"" from the Grand Canyon Suite.  Great!  Really was in keeping with the morning.  In this first section of Michigan there seemed to be a chain of NPR stations, about six that were identified.  Later on, there was a real dearth of NPR stations.  I couldn't seem to find any outlets in the western half of the Upper Peninsula.  Along with the pletora of maps I seem to need to carry, maybe I should make a list of the NPR stations too before I leave. US 2 was a very good road at this point.  Wide shoulder for all along the way, low rolling resistance, miniscule hills.  They just need to put up a few ""Bike Route"" signs.  Heck, they could do this for the entire length of Rt. 2 in the upper peninsula.  Came to Naubaway, located at the northernmost of Lake Michigan.  A fishing village.  There was some geographical significance, before this area of the US was laid out, to this point.  Another nice treat in Naubaway: I needed to refill the money clip, found a bank with an ATM which was willing to give me $300, and only charged a buck-and-a-half!  I understand the need for the fee, but I really try and avoid it where I can.  My bank (US Bank) is all over Wisconsin but I couldn't find any in Michigan.  But a $1.50 was certainly reasonable. Small grocery store too in Naubaway.  In addition to plums, I bought a couple of small packages of roasted almonds and added 'em to the trail mix I was carrying and munching on.  Mmmm!  This gave me a taste for another piece of the fudge I was carrying from the Island, but then I discovered a minor disaster: I cross-threaded the Gatorade bottle, it leaked a little, and how I had some red stains on the socks I was carrying!  Not a big deal, fortunately, and I cleaned up the mess as best I could.   Someplace along the way, I ran into a pelethon of girls on bikes!  About 15 or so, and young too.  I thought maybe I was dreaming!  They were loaded, maybe on a supported tour or something!  They all waved, and I think they got a kick out of seeing an old geezer fully loaded (the bike, that is) going the opposite direction.   While you're riding, I think your brain shuts down or slows down.  Only after I had passed them by a mile or so did it occur to me that I should have crossed the road, talked to them, taken pictures, found out that the action was.  It just plain didn't occur to me to do this at the time.  Damn, I really must be getting old.   Along the way, I came across another roadside park.  There are many of these, of several varieties.  This was was new, not quite finished, and a couple of guys were there from the highway department.  A recent inovation: the rest area was to be completely SOLAR POWERED! One panel, mounted high on a pole, which could, on a sunny day, sustain the water pump.  There was a housing, though, for the battery storage and pump.  To be installed was a map with a push-button light.  The toilets were pit toilets, at the other end.  When finished, the rest area would be stand-alone, requiring no power.   Unfortunately, there was no water at the time I was there.  They had just clorinated the well, and were sampling the way and testing it for several days before they opened the valve to the drinking fountain.  I was told there were about five of these completed, two more in the final stages, and if they worked out more would be planned for the future. About 5 PM, it did start to rain.  I converted to the rain mode (put an outer covering on the bags, stashed stuff inside the plastic, changed into the shoes intended for water use, stuffed the good shoes under cover, etc) and continued riding.  It wasn't bad.  Soon the rain got heavier, and turned into a downpour just short of Manistique.  I headed for a gas station with a canopy but by then I was soaked.  Considered my dilemna for a few minutes, and enquired about cheap motels in the direction I was headed.  Happily, I was told there were several.  In a few minutes the rain lightened, I headed out, within 1000 feet it began to pour again but within another 2000 feet I came to a motel.  Quickly headed for cover, dug out the towel and tried to appear presentable before reqistering.  (I don't think I quite made the presentable part.)  Soon I was ensconced in the room, and watched it pour for about two hours or so.  Around 8 PM it finally quit or at least went down to a drizzle.   I went a short distance to another restuarant, had a ""Pastie"" - which seem to be native to Michigan.  Sort of like a pot pie.  Roast beef and vegtables inside a dough covering with gravy.  It was pretty good.  And I thought I should try some of the local food anyway.  Shortly after this I went down to the beach and saw a rainbow. Really not a bad day; actually, a pretty good day overall.
"
66,"There's a pattern here to the towns: the rivers and streams enter the lake at about right angles.  The towns must have been started along the banks of the river.  Later, the highway was added, running parallel to the lake shore.  As a result, the downtown areas are om streets at right angles, away from the highway.  Always a short distance, but not on but away from US 2.  Manistique is located on Bay du Noc (is this Bay of the North?)  Anyway, a trucker joined me for breakfast the Mary Ann's.  He was from England originally, moved to Canada, and finally to Manistiue.  He told me he had an old Raleigh bike which he sometimes road and wished he could take a long trip too.  So I learned a little about the area, the people, and the culture.  Great way to spend breakfast.   An unusual feature of the river and lake: covered with sawdust!  About a hundred years worth from the lumber industry there.  Sawdust was a big problem in those days.  AT first they dumped it in the river, but then it really became a mess.  So they started to barge it out into the lake.  Sawdust floats, so eventually it came back.  There really isn't too much lumbering industry now and of course I'm sure some environmentalists woke up but still the residual of these past practices lingers on.  Lots of snowmobile trails but few bike trails in this area.
"
67,"Plus decide were to stay, since the day is still in progress.  At least I'm now in Wisconsin, by less than a mile anyway. Mushed on to Peshtigo, WI, city campground. From Martinette campground, it was a 22 mile ride to find coffee and breakfast!  Good breakfast, but a heckuva long way to go for coffee. But I did get a chance to skinny dip in Lake Michigan!  It was cold, but isolated and now at least I can say I DID IT!     I saw a bike route sign in Menominee, I think it was the only bike sign I saw in the upper peninsula!  Not big on bike riding, I guess - but they should be because the road shoulders are ideal bike paths. They are big on snowmobile trails, however.   Stopped at the Marinette public library, met up with a few young women, part of a bike club holding a meeting!  Naturally, I joined in and shared all my experiences.   Leaving Marinette, I found Old Peshtigo Road, which parallled Rt 45, so I took that.  Only got a little bit lost when I made a wrong turn.    But stayed in the city campground.  Finished up about dusk, 9:00 PM Central Time, only slightly below the 45th parallel.
"
68,"Go to: http://community.webshots.com/user/kastigar then scroll down to the Lake Michigan series of albums.  I didn't edit the pictures, and wasn't too selective about which to post.   Also, I only captioned a few of them, the rest I hope you can pretty much figure out. I did this on Friday, 7/16, after about two weeks into the trip. From the Hometown Internet Cafe, on Cty Hwy Y, in Oconto, WI.  Right next to a coffee shop, so I was all set and spent a couple of hours doing this. Enjoy, send email, send comments.   Some of the place names may be spelled wrong. Mea Culpa. Somehow, I didn't think it was important to plan the ride through northeast Wisconsin.  Dumb move, because I hadn't the faintest idea where to go!  A quick look at the map suggested Rt. 22 as a route which ran kinda southwest, towards Wisconsin Dells, where I was going.  Not a bad route, but I deviated a little and followed some country roads that paralleled 22, and got a little lost.  Would up back on Rt 22 in Cecil, WI, a sort-of camping/fishing resort area, but only about 8 easy miles to Showano. Considering I spent quite a few hours fooling around in the internet cafe, and drinking coffee from the place next door, I may not have travelled far but I got a lot done.
"
69,"Following 22, I got sent onto an expressway!  However, the next exit was a continuation of 22 South.  Just past the underpass, there was a paved bike route, off-road.  I followed it for a couple of miles where it ended and dumped me back onto Rt. 22 South. South.  Rt 22 makes several turns and at some point actually runs north for a short distance.  When I got off the bike path the compass indicated I was traveling north!  That I didn't like, but I coudln't see how I could be wrong.  I was going up a hill, and didn't want to turn around and then have to return up the hill.  Finally, I came to a sign that said ""22 South"" and an intersection I could compare with the map - and see how this confusion could come up. Also, in Shawana, there is a bike route which I'm told goes from Green Bay all the way to Wasau.  It was at right-angles to my intended route.  So I'm not sure if it's a completed route or not.  What little I did see of it, however, looked pretty good. Tried the public library at Manawa, but it closed at noon on Saturdays.      Then a bad part: about 6 miles north of Wild Rose, WI road construction.  The surface was torn and prepped for application of a new layer.  It was like riding on a waffle iron, or a six-mile rumble strip!  Really bad, and slow, and no simple alternative.  Finally, the construction stopped at Wild Rose, but continued south.  I was able to find a parallel route, using country roads, but this was very hilly.  Where my road re-joind Rt. 22 the new paving was finished so it was nice and smooth.  But only a short distance to Wautoma.   Only the expensive motels in Wautoma, so I kept going although it was getting late.  On to Coloma. On the way, and although it was getting dark, I ran by the headquarters for the International Union of Operating Engineers, Local 139, which covers all of Wisconsin.  A picnic was in progress.  A BIG picnic, for the retirees.  I had to stop and check it out.   I asked ""Could an IBEW member arrange to camp for the night?"" and I was greeted with open arms.  If they had food left, they would have fed me.  They kept trying to get me stuff to drink.  It was a great time.  There were many people who travelled there with campers, and were set to camp in the parking lot.  It was late, I was told Coloma was only a mile or two, so I took off.  Great bunch of friendly uion people. http://www.iuoe139.com/    Bad move.  Coloma is less than 1000 people, no motels.  I asked at the big gas station (this is right adjacent to I-39) and was told of a campground 2 miles back (squeezed in between campers) or 13 miles to the next big intersection.  Even though it was dark, I had two flashers and a light on front and decided to go on. However, just past the expressway hill, was a road marked ""Dead End"" and I decided to investigate.  Only 1/2 miles long but a dead end.  Nothing on either side or at the end.  It looks like a road build by mistake.  It goes nowhere to nothing.  A perfect place for guerrila camping.  So I did.    The road was pea gravel on asphalt, so it wasn't bad riding.  There were weeds along it.  I went into the pine forest, but there were too many pine cones and sticks to set up camp.  So I set the tent alongside the road.  On top of the weeds.  By this time it was dark, so I stripped, did the water-bottle bath thing, and crawled in.  Perfect end to the day.  And free too.  No problem all night and just as empty in the morning.   "
70,"Followed Rt. 21 west until I can across a familiar country road and headed south to a resuaratn/bar where my daughter was supposed to be working.  Alas, she had taken the day off so I called here and rode back, about 2 miles, to her place.  However, I plugged the darn cell phone in to recharge and forgot the thing.  So she had to drive me back to get it.  After spending a couple of hours with her, I rode the final 14 miles into Wisconsin Dells and arrived at my sons house around 5 PM. I'm going to stay here for a couple of days, visiting, and had back to Chicago mid-week or something like that.  I'm WAY ahead of schedule.  I still have two more weeks off work, but you know how it is: you get antsy to get home.   "
71,"You shout ""LET'S GO FOR A BIKE RIDE!!!!!"" And we did.  We loaded the bikes in my daughter's truck and took a bike rack in my son's car.  We drove to Sparta and dropped off the car, went to Elroy and exited the truck with the bikes.  Rode the 32 mile path, through the three tunnels, tied (literally) the bikes on the car and drove back. Driving miles: 134 Riding Miles: 32    Hot, we stopped several times.  They are not long distance experienced.  My daughter Jennifer said her shoulders hurt, my son Mark said his rear end hurt, and my granddaughter Gennie thought the tunnels were very scarey.  Well, OK, Grandpa kept turning off the headlight in the middle of the tunnel, made up stories about why the walls were bricked up, what the hollowed out spaces were for, etc.  Funniest line: in the 3rd, and longest tunnel, my granddaughter was getting a little scared.  She wanted to stay in the middle, with me in front and Mark and Jennifer close behind.  When they fell back she would start yelling ""Mass Up! Mass Up!"" to get us grouped together again. At lunch at Norwalk, the Black Squirrel Capital of the World.  Norwalk Cafe, part of the Norwalk Bar.  Chicken Salad sandwiches, which were delicious.  And root beer in chilled glass mugs.  At Speed's Bike Shop, at the end of the trail in Sparta I had the rear tire replaced.  It was worn to the point where the lasts were showing through the bottom!  I was concerned about taking it, but I couldn't find a darn replacement in the Dells or Baraboo or anywhere!   The official website of the Elroy-Sparta Trail is at: http://www.elroy-sparta-trail.com/ and if you're in the area I would highly recommend it. You could take the 400 Trail from the east, and continue on the LaCrosse River trail to the west if you like - the then bike up the Great River Trail along the Mississippi. A great day spend with the family, and a memorable part of the trip.
"
72,"Wisconsin Dells to the Lake Mills Campsite: 80 miles, roughly 9 AM until about 7:30 PM or so. Up early, at 5:00 AM, checked my email and the weather on the web.  Went to breakfast with my daughter Jennifer at 7, , then to Sunday church (gotta be flexible on a bike trip!) at 8, then back to my son's place to kiss my granddaughter goodbye and remind her of the Critical Mass ride in Chicago the Friday of next week. I had planned to 'straight-line' it home - sticking to the main highways with shoulders rather than deviating to the country roads.  Leaving Wisconsin Dells south towards Portage, Rt. 16 is a relatively flat (only two significant hills) but invites two alternatives: Rt 127 (bad, very hilly) and Cty O, which isn't to bad.  Any all lead to the same place, more or less.    There's a roadside rest area just south of the Dells on Rt. 16, which, in my opinion, would be perfect for guerrilla camping if you wanted to avoid the high-priced motels in Wisconsin Dells.  Deep, it extends far back from the road, isolated, and has water.  It's on the site of ancient burial grounds, from the indigenous people who lived there around 800-1000 AD.  This might give some pause. Other than that, Rt. 16 is boring.  In Portage, the Columbia County Fair was in progress, so I spend a couple of hours at the fair, looking at the animals and watching a couple of judging sessions.  So much for straight-lining it home. In Portage, just south of the main section, there's a bike path a couple of miles long that sits atop the levee along the Wisconsin River.  Nice, except there are few places to get on and off.  I had to ride the grass hill to go to the grocery store, to go to the fair, and to stop for a malt.  South of town, Rt. 16 promised to be too boring - so I broke for a couple of country roads, O and P, to get to Wyocena.  This bypassed a lot of Rt. 16, which really is pretty good riding - except boring. At Rio (pronounced RYE-oh) I headed south on C (no shoulder, east on V a short distance to N, which had a reasonable marked shoulder. All the way to the Glacial-Drumlin Trail:  http://www.glacialdrumlin.com/ Nice trail, crushed gravel but not limestone screenings.  Scenic, but very slow.  For most of the way, it parallels Rt. 18 so when you get tired of pushing gravel you can hop off onto the highway (nice shoulder) for a couple of miles.   Roughly 1/3 of the way from the western terminus at Cottage Grove is Lake Mills, where the trail headquarters is located.  It was closed when I arrived, but the bathrooms and showers are always open.  Instead of a motel (about three miles north of the trail) I opted for the Sandhill Station State Campground, about a mile south.  I took a shower and rode south near dusk.  The campground is primitive, and it's a walk-in campground.  A small parking lot with no cars and then you need to walk a short distance to campsites.  Each is a cleared space with a picnic table.  The wildflowers were about five feet high so each campsite is relatively isolated, and they're far apart.  As far as I could tell, I was the only one there.  Great campsite for bikers.   "
73,"Up and rolling from the campsite at about 6:30 AM.  I rode back north, a mile to the trail and then another mile-and-a-half to the center of town, and breakfast at the Café on the Park.  If there is a Bicycle God, Lake Miles is the residence.  Small town, a very nice park in the center of town, a quaint homey restaurant, right along the bike trail with free showers and next to a big lake. There's a reasonable motel about another mile or so north, south of the expressway.  A public library, shops, but small.  A perfect place to come across on a trip. I try and arrange to stay here whenever I can.      So by 8:30 I was headed out again, along the trail.  It is slow.  The trail remained slow, and I took the shoulder of 18 for a little while.  The trail continues to Waukesha, just west of Milwaukee but I got off at Rt. 83, near Wales.  Incidentally, the trail is now paved further west, beginning at about Dousman.   Along 83 (more traffic than I remember, but still a nice shoulder, I took a half-hour nap on a picnic bench in Mukwanago.  Along about Waterford, I found another trail, and the sign included a map.  True, the trail wiggled a bit and added to the distance but it was a break from the highway, so I took it to Burlington.  I'm sure that north of Burlington there's a paved trail along the highway, but I never found it!  Instead, I followed a gravel trail that lead to a park inside of town, a couple of blocks from the highway.  I got here around 6:30, and I remembered I was about a mile south of a motel right across the street from a 24-hour restaurant with a great breakfast.  Hmmmm.  What to do?   So I mushed on, heading another 12-15 miles east to the Bong Stage Recreation Area and Campground.  Perhaps a minor mistake, since this was a Friday.  Upon arrival, the office said 'Campground Full' but they squeezed me into a space.  The trouble is, this campsite, the Sunset Campground, was about 3 miles west of the entrance, back the way I came!  And no showers, except at the Sunrise Campground which was another mile in the opposite direction.  Nuts.  So I skipped the shower and headed right for the campsite. Many mosquitoes, so I had to use the DEET.  Then, sweaty and covered with DEET, I crawled into the tent and sleeping bag.  Not the most comfortable night, and the campsite wasn't far enough from the noisy highway besides.  It got cool and there was considerable condensation.  It might as well have rained, everything go so wet.   Still, it was cheap and managed to help me make a personal goal: traveling between Wisconsin Dells and Chicago without staying at a motel.
"
74,"Bong Campground to home: 76 miles.   Up at about 5:30, smelly, damp.  Packed up the (wet) tent and (wet) sleeping bag.  Some serious cleaning to do when I got home.  Rode directly to the showers (there were a few people there at 6:30 AM) and got cleaned up for the day.   I was on the road by 6:30, and it was a 15 mile trek to the expressway where I knew a very good restaurant was located.  Kielbasa and eggs for breakfast! I followed the road into Kenosha, then south to the start of the trail, and series of trails back to home.  Along the way, I met a couple of other cycle tourists - on recumbents!  Heading for Stevens Point and some kindofa rally.  I shared with them my experience and route, since there were essentially going back along the trail I'd just blazed.  Both of the recumbents were hand made - truly amazing to me.   The usual off-road route: the Kenosha Trail to the McClory Trail, through Highland Park (crowded! Some kindofa sidewalk sale) to the Green Bay Trail.  For the return trip, I opted to go west to the North Shore Trail, rather than retrace my steps along the McCormick trail.  Partly just for the change, and also because this would take be by the grocery store for some necessities for home: rye break, coffee, cream, and chocolate milk. With those necessities, I figured I could wake up at home and have everything I needed.   I arrived home safely around 6:30 or so.  Lugged half the stuff upstairs to my apartment and unpacked everything.  Lugged the other half up later and did the same.  I've found the best thing to do is to put everything away soon, get back to normal as soon as possible.  I still had to wash the tent and sleeping bag, but I put that off until the next day.  I hung the stuff in the garage to air out and dry out.  Then downloaded the 417 messages still on the server waiting for me.
"
75,"Things I didn't need: 	Mostly the tools.  But then I would have been insecure without them.  No flats the whole trip, no major mechanical hassles.  Really a most problem-free trip.  	Camp chair, goes with the Therma-Rest pad.  Small and light, but I never had an occasion to use it. Things my son laughed at, but which came in handy: clothespins. Dumbest thing I bought along the way to carry home: 	Two cartons of cigarettes in Wisconsin, from the Ho Chunck Indian Reservation.  Dumb.  Really dumb.  Just trying to beat the Cook County tax added last April.  But still dumb.  Best meal of the trip: Breakfast, everyday - even the day I had to ride 22 miles for it. Worst meal of the trip: Trail mix at the guerrilla camp, and even that wasn't so bad. New experience: a 'pastie' in Michigan. (Sorta like a pot pie, roast beef, potatoes, vegetable wrapped in dough and baked, with gravy on the side.) Biggest disappointment: didn't run into many other cycling tourists. Highlight experience of the trip: 	None, or all of them.  This really was one of the best tours I've ever done.  There was no single highlight experience.  I had expected riding conditions to be worse than they were, but no major mountains to climb and most of the roads had comfortable shoulders.  I'd do this again, maybe in the other direction.  To some people, maybe this trip would seem to boring overall.   It was shorter than I expected.  I guess-timated about 1200 miles, and on previous trip I've had to allow maybe an extra 25% or more.  But that didn't happen on this trip, the estimate held pretty closely.  Of course, following the shoreline doesn't leave much room for deviating.   Most trips, I wind up rushing by everything the first week, anticipating not reaching my goal in the allotted time off work.  I made a conscious effort not to do that this trip, and even with the planned dallying I still completed the trip in three weeks time, including all the visiting days and had a whole extra week off after I got home.  The weather cooperated fantastically, which probably helped considerably.  It was cool most days, few blinding sun hot days.  Only two or three headwind days, the rest the wind was calm or at my back.  On the only two rain days, I had shelter or a planned layover and was comfortable.  I don't think it could have been much better.  The northern climes threw me off a little bit, with the later starts in the day, but the longer daylight in the evening.  I guess I was just lucky this trip.  What I lost on the trip: 	Maybe a couple of pounds, but the biggest loss was a little tripod I carried that I got from REI several years ago.  It was only a few inches long, but you could mount the camera and do a time-delay picture.  Fortunately, I was able to order a replacement on-line, and it'll be ready for the next trip.  I was a bit sloppy in packing it every time I used it, so it's my own fault for losing it. Mitzvah's I got to do on the trip: 	Found a notebook on the roadside, mailed it back anonymously. 	Found a textbook on a picnic bench, turned it into a nearby office. 	A cycling family, with a damaged front wheel.  I released it, but they still needed to roll it home. Myths I've discovered aren't true, or things I found on the internet that don't work: 	Vitamin B1 discourages mosquitoes. I've been taking B1 for some time, it doesn't keep the mosquitoes away. 	Your hair and nails quit growing on a long bike trip.  Not true.  My fingernails may have been worn short, but the toenails and hair grew normally. Things I learned this trip: 	Slow down, enjoy the flowers.

77,"   --------- Accommodations:  Jordan Junction Hiker-Biker campsite on the C&O Canal  My mom snapped a photo of me, and I was off--in search of coffee in ""downtown"" Harpers Ferry.  I did a little sightseeing as I sipped my brew.                I eventually got moving and enjoyed the day.  The weather switched back and forth between sun and rain a total of three times.  I got very muddy but never too hot.  I called it quits around 3:30, set up camp, ate in the rain, washed up under the well, called Gail, and read myself to sleep.  Overall, a good day.     "

One female touring cyclist to another as they passed my campsite this morning while I packed up my tent. After I woke up, I packed my valuables and left camp to ride the two miles back to Williamsport.  This is my first bike trip since I've been addicted to coffee (and my first since I started law school--those two go hand-in-hand), so I was in search of a big breakfast with a tall cup of joe.  I found what I was looking for at Jack's Busy Corner Restaurant.  Pancakes, eggs, sausage, and coffee was what I found.  And there were plenty of retirees sitting around playing video Keno and shooting the breeze to induldge my people-watching tendencies. Back at the campsite, I slowly got my day going, and I called the Western Maryland Scenic Railroad to inquire about train service from Cumberland to Frostburg.  Taking the train is recommended by the Allegheny Trail Alliance because it cuts out about 15 miles of road riding, most of which are climbs.  I made a reservation for me and the rig (an extra five bucks) for the following morning at 11:30.  I was happy to have the ticket, but it meant that I had to get to Cumberland (85 miles away) in 24 hours.  I felt very good a few miles into my trek, so I decided to make a go at the entire 85 miles in one day.  Then I could treat myself to a motel room and sleep in a little bit in the morning.  The weather was nice, so I just knocked out the miles...          Ten miles east of Hancock I spotted the sign for the Western Maryland Rail Trail.  I had seen the trail from Interstate 70 as I have traveled back and forth between Cleveland and Northern Virginia over the past year, but I didn't realize that the access between the canal and rail trail was so convenient.  Anyway, to make a long story short, riding the rail trail was well worth my while.  I saved about a mile of riding (because the railroad right of way doesn't hug the twisty river as much as the canal does), a lot of effort (riding on pavement is almost always better than riding on a soggy trail), and felt less guilty because I wasn't tearing up the towpath for that portion.  Lunch was in Hancock.  That's also where I picked up eight dollar sunglasses at a gas station.  Then the trail extended another ten miles to the west of Hancock before coming to an abrupt end, where I was forced to return to the canal.                Pizza for dinner.  Laundry and then bedtime.  A very good day.
"
79,"---------- Accommodations:  In Town Inn First stop this morning was the post office to mail back to Cleveland my tent, sleeping bag and pad, and a few other camping items.  My journey today would put me within range of plenty of B&B's but no campsites.  Second stop was McDonalds for a late breakfast.  Quick note on the downtown Cumberland McDonald's:  Average patron age:  72.        After the train ride, I rode into downtown Frostburg for lunch.  Then I headed to the student union at Frostburg State U. to relax on a bench and later change and prepare for my afternoon ride.  The ride would consist of about 20 miles of road riding, up and over Big Savage Mountain, through some back roads and then to the trailhead of the trail that leads to Pittsburgh.      After crawling up Big Savage Mountain I crossed the state line and had a great ride on some sparsely traveled roads, getting lost twice, but eventually finding my way to the trailhead in Meyersdale.          I pulled into Rockwood (a quaint town along the trail) around 6:15 and Jean, the proprietor of the In Town Inn, was waiting for me on the front porch with her dog Ebby.  We had a nice chat about the day's ride, and then she showed me to my room.  I had a big dinner across the street for five bucks(!), took a shower, talked to Gail, and went to bed early.  A little sore from yesterday but another very good day.
"
80,"---------- Jean made me breakfast and we sat together sipping our cups of coffee as she provided some economic analysis of running a business in a small town.  She was happy about the trail coming through town (the trail is only about ten years old) and eagerly anticipates the day when it will be contiguous (with no detours) from Cumberland to Pittsburgh.  She's hopeful the business from the trail will really pick up then.  Currently, traveling bicyclists like myself account for a full quarter of her business.  All very interesting stuff. Anyway, I got my stuff packed up, and she walked me to the garage where my bike was stored.  She jokingly scolded me for locking it up--saying that I was her first guest to ever lock up a bike.  She wished me good luck in my wedding, patted me twice on my left shoulder, and I was on my way.       I took the morning ride very slow.  Although I had slept a lot the night before, the 90 miles two days prior, had caught up to me--I was tired.  After lunch in Confluence, I called Gail to schedule a pick up there six hours later.  My plan was to head back to the trail, find a park bench and read and relax until she swung through town.  But, once I got moving I felt fine and was able to pedal at a moderate pace.  I decided to make a final push for Ohiopyle (ohio pile), call Gail to change the pick-up location, and then rest.  But, with four miles to go, the skies opened up and I got drenched.  It felt good though.  I finished the ride hard, rolled into Ohiopyle, changed, and relaxed while I waited for Gail.  During that time I had a brief conversation with a woman who was nearly finished with her Pacific to Atlantic national traverse.  She has come a long way and was excited to hear about the conditions ahead.  Her website:  www.geocities.com/GEBUH. The rendevous with Gail went perfectly.  We packed up the bike, walked the dog, ate dinner, and headed back toward Northern Virginia.  In the car I tried not to annoy her too much pointing out the places where I had just been a day or two prior.   Another good trip completed.

82,"All reasoning aside, Iceland seemed about right for a one month trip.  The Ring Road around the island could be ridden in about a month, and there was plenty to see along the way.  Many travellers had told me to get to Iceland if I could.  Usually, I don't listen to what other travellers have to say, but this time I did, and was very happy to have done so. A quick note about the spelling of places.  I have no idea where to find Icelandic characters, so the spellings are about as close as I can get phonetically.  Places are not exactly as spelt. I also would like to apologize for the really awful exposures.  There was a mechanical problem on my camera, causing everything to end up being underexposed in bright light.  I've done my best to recover them from the dead with Photoshop, but there is only so much you can do.  Iceland is much more photogenic than the pictures show, so just imagine that everything is brighter and more contrasty.  Or try adjusting your monitor to compensate for my @$#%$^@#^$ camera.
"
83,"I took a Rocky Mountain Concorde.  As I was expecting only marginally bumpy roads, I changed the front suspension forks to rigid forks, and picked up a heavy duty rack. For the gravel roads, I kept the knobby tires on.   There was not much else to do, except pack the bike in a box.  It was not too difficult, but I had a snag trying to remember which way to turn the wrench to get the pedals off.  For a short time, I was tightening them instead.  (The easy way to remember which way to turn the wrench is to go in the opposite direction that you pedal.   Put the wrench onto the thing that attaches the pedal to the crank, turn the crank, and see which way the wrench rotates.  Push in the opposite direction.)   Because the accommodations were expensive in Iceland, I planned on camping and cooking most of the time, and packed accordingly.  The non exhaustive list of items I took were: Arkel 54 L world tour panniers MEC bar bag MEC frame bag 35 l daypack gortex jacket 1 pair hiking boots socks and underwear aqua socks silk shirt convertible shorts/pants shorts helmet Olympus OM-2 with 28-200 mm Tamron lens, 2x doubler, 24 mm prime, Pentax 38-90 WR camera, 20 rolls 400 ASA film MEC Tarn II tent Sleeping bag Thermarest mat (no mosquito net this time!)

"
84,"My flight from Vancouver was on Northwest Airlines, which was best described as 'You get what you pay for.'  Despite the shabby looking airplane, I arrived without any delays in Minneapolis, where I spent the next seven hours in the airport.  Arguably, the airport in Minneapolis was the worst part of the trip.  It was just like a being in a shopping mall that you cannot leave.  To exacerbate an already unpleasant situation, the airport businesses try to encourage you to leave as much money as possible during your wait.  This is done in some subtle ways, like the complete absence of comfortable chairs or benches anywhere in the public space.   A strange observation-nearly everyone in the airport was caucasian, except for the staff.  Coming from a place like Vancouver where 20% of the people are born outside the country, it was unusual to see so much uninterrupted white skin in one place.   I wandered around the airport in a fruitless search for a lounge where you could relax without having to buy an overpriced drink.  There was no escape from the generica that malls seem to encourage, along with the soon to be annoying odour of cinnamon buns.  With little luck finding comfortable and free seating, I spent the rest of the time sitting on hard wooden benches, and browsing through stacks of  overpriced CDs that I had no intention of buying. There was trouble when I checked in for my flight to Rejkjavik. It seemed that I needed to check in at the front gate, even though I was only transferring from one plane to another.  Ooooo! I hate travelling through the US!  However, I managed to get a seat without having to clear US customs and return again. I was soon flying away, and ecstatic to finally be out of the airport.  Because of all the fuss I encountered while boarding, I wondered whether my luggage was going to make it to Iceland. From the air, Minneapolis did not look too bad.  Green trees, and plenty of parks and waterways.  However, it was evident how urban sprawl creates its own problems.  If you need a car to get to the mall because it is far away, the mall gets further away because of all the parking spaces you need to put in.  Honestly, the mall I flew over must have been three quarters parking lot! As for the flight to Iceland, Iceland Air was pretty good, with lots of space and very clean and proper looking airplanes.  It was a far cry from the Northwest flight, which had the look and feel of a Greyhound bus.  But seven hours in a glorified shopping mall had taken its toll, and I fell asleep soon after the take off.
"
85,"Compared to the Great Wall of America, Iceland customs was remarkably simple, and I was through quickly.  My bike arrived undented and undamaged.  Packing it in the proper size box may have made a difference.  To top things off, all my baggage had made it as well, so my paranoid delusions about being stuck in an airport with only one pannier had been for nothing. At 7:30 AM, I put the bike back together, and rode out of the airport.  It was exhilarating, as it was the first time I had actually ridden from the airport.  No need for cabs of busses.    There was only a slight breeze, and the air was cool and clear.  I did not really have a firm plan, except to get away from the airport, and closer to the ferry terminal at Thorlakshavn.   I took the coastal road, and headed towards Grundavik, about 60 km away.  It was the largest town on the way to the ferry.  Depending on when I arrived and how I felt, it might be a good place to stop.  According to my guidebook, there was a campground in the town, and places to buy supplies.      After I got out of the airport's proximity, traffic and population just disappeared.  One minute, I was riding along a trafficked road, and the next minute I was alone on a barren peninsula. My only company were the birds.  Arctic terns had just started nesting, and they were constantly dive bombing me as I rode past their nests.  It was just one more reason for wearing a helmet.    As I rode along the coast, I began to see the geological history of the peninsula.  Much of the Rejkanes peninsula was created by lava flows from 20000 years ago.  Life was barely carving its way onto the rock, with lichens gradually pushing their way into the crags and cracks.  With such harsh conditions, there was little settlement, and I barely saw a soul during the morning ride.  It was amazing to see how life was gradually encroaching over the rocks.  Near the airport, the land was newest, and the lava flows had no vegetation.  Further on, the land was older, and the lava was covered in lichen.  As I approached Grundavik, there was enough soil for pasture.            When I arrived in Grundavik, I was so happy to find a place where there were people.  Considering I had seen one person on that morning's ride, it felt like I was arriving in a metropolis.  The town was a few thousand people in size, and looked like it would be a good place to get supplies.  When I pedalled into town, it was a bit after lunch.  Finding the campsite turned out to be much easier than I expected, mostly because of the big sign with the universal camp site symbol on it.  This was a far cry from some places I have cycled, where there are rarely signs, and if there are, they are in another language.  As the tourist season had not yet started, the campsite was still in the final stages of completion.  There was no water yet, and the showers had yet to be installed.  It was necessary to go to the neighbouring swimming pool. I rode to the local grocery store and noticed that nobody locked their bikes.  It was a welcome sight to see, and comforting to know that it would not be necessary to maintain constant vigilance.  However, the prices inside the store were a rude shock.  While I had been steeling myself for the inevitable register shock, it was still painful to pay so much for so little.  Even though there is little crime in Iceland, you could argue that you get robbed every time you buy something.   After the shopping sticker shock, I rode to the local library and discovered there was a bank machine in the building.  The ATM screen looked like a UN decoration, with all the flags it displayed.  I chose the flag for the UK, and punched buttons following the English prompts.  Much to my delight, a wad of crispy Icelandic money popped out of the machine.  It was good to be in a place where you could access money from home, rather than having to cash traveller's cheques or lug around wads of hard currency.  I was beginning to appreciate why people go to developed countries. I spent the rest of the afternoon chatting with some people at a gas station where I had gone to get some fuel.  By comparison to everything else, the liter of unleaded petrol seemed unbelievably cheap. The gas station had free coffee, which was unfortunate, as I am not a coffee drinker. I missed out on the only freebie in Iceland. After I left the gas station, I rode around the town, and stopped to watch a children's football (soccer) game in the field next to the campsite.   I was starting to feel the effects of the flight, and was happy to just relax and watch a bunch of kids kick a ball around.  When the game finished, I suddenly felt very tired.  Rather than cook something, I made a few cheese sandwiches and turned in.  It was only about eight, but I was exhausted.  As I was getting to bed, some workmen came by to install a new shower cabin.  Later in my trip I found out that tourist season would start the next day, and they were applying the worldwide practice of procrastination.
"
86,"If you are wide awake, and it is light enough to ride, why not go?  I packed up and left, leaving the sleeping town of Grundavik behind me.  Barely one kilometer out of town, the road turned to gravel, and started ascending into the hills.  It was a steep 200 m to the top of the hill, where the views would have been good if it were sunny out.      As I descended down the other side, the scenery changed from bare, rocky hills to patchy green fields, and then back to lichen covered lava.  My guidebook mentioned that there was a turnoff to an abandoned village close by.    The road to a mythical abandoned village was certainly well camouflaged, despite the usual description in the guidebook that said that it was easy to find.  I found a track that looked promising, and went for a hike in a sea of lichen covered lava.  If there was a village there, I could certainly see why it was abandoned.  My theory is that everyone got lost trying to get back.  Even so, it was fun to scrabble around on the lava near the ocean side.     After a half hour of fruitless wandering in a lava field, I got back on the bike and continued. The road got rougher as I went on.  It was the worst kind of dirt road for bicycling, covered with loose gravel that had been molded into a washboard.  The clank of gravel striking my bike was interrupted by one louder clank.  As it did not sound like a spoke breaking, I paid no attention, until I looked at my bike computer and saw that it was gone.  Murphy was starting to enforce his law.  Somehow, the vibration from the gravel had loosened the computer, and it fell off somewhere on the road.  Despite my best efforts, I could not find it, and would have to continue without one.  At least the sun had come out, if only for a few minutes.    Losing my bike computer was completely unexpected.  This made it hard to guess how far I had gone.  While that might not be a problem in a populated area with lots of signs and people around, in Iceland, road signs came by once every ten or twenty kilometers, if they came by at all.  Guessing how far you had ridden became a matter of counting snowguards on the roadsides, and using that as a best guess to distance.  On a more positive note, the days never really turned into night, so that it was never really an issue about having to ride in the dark.    According to my guidebook, the ferry to the Vestmannaeyjar islands was supposed to leave at three thirty.  As I had just lost of my bike computer, I had no idea what time it was, or how much further I had to go.  The brief break in the clouds passed, and soon it started to drizzle.  Eventually, I passed a small town and was able to get my bearings again.  It would be close, but I could still make it to the ferry in time.  I laboured up a 5 km hill in the pouring rain and wind, and then cruised down towards Thorlakshafn and the ferry. When I arrived at the ferry, it was empty.  There was a hand written sign in Icelandic on the ticket window, and nothing else.  Nobody was around to translate the  Icelandic, and there was no ferry in the dock.  This was the kind of disruption I would expect in a developing country, but Iceland?  I waited around the terminal for a few minutes, hoping that somebody would show up who could explain where the ferry was and if it would leave tomorrow.  My phrase book was no use whatsoever, and the sign on the ticket window remains a mystery to this day.  Disappointed, I rode to the campsite and set up. There was only one other vehicle there, and it was a strange German tourist and his ten year old son.  By the time I had set up, my legs turned to jelly, and I fell asleep for four hours.  When I woke, I took a walk around town, only to find that it was mostly closed for the evening.  Like lots of small towns, teenagers cruised the roads in their parent's cars, no doubt complaining about the lack of activities in the town and wishing they were anywhere else.
"
87,"  Thorskmork was a national park about a hundred twenty kilometers away.  The highway went within thirty kilometers, where there was a rough gravel road the rest of the way.  Though the guidebooks had said the road to the park was rough for bikes, it was rideable, although there were about ten to twenty spots where it was necessary to ford streams.    I set off as the wind and rain started to pick up.  About 5 km out of town, I noticed my knees felt a bit sore.  They continued to worsen as the day went on, despite switching to a lower gear and increasing my cadence.  The day's ride went through more farmland, with the ever present volcanic backdrop.  This area must be spectacular when it is clear.  Meanwhile, I passed a sign pointing to a farm that said 'Bjork'.  It did not look like she was there, so I continued on.    About sixty kilometers later, I started looking for a place to camp.  My knees were not getting better, and it was time to stop before I seriously hurt myself.  Hella was a small town that was only a few kilometers away.   By the time I arrived in Hella, it was around two, and I settled in for another exciting day of small town life in Iceland.  The town seemed to have sprouted up because of its proximity to a bridge.  Other than the bridge, there did not seem to be much around except some farms and a gas station.  Surprisingly, the town had two campsites.   I took a look at the first campsite, and decided that it was good enough.  For 600 kr, there were hot showers, a restaurant, and an enclosed area for cooking and eating.  It was by the river, which had little pieces of pumice floating in it.    Once the tent setup was done, I went to buy some groceries, and discovered that smoked salmon was only marginally more than buying meat.  As this was the only thing that was remotely close to being a good deal, I was soon living off smoked salmon sandwiches with cheese.   With nothing else to do, I ordered a beer in the campsite restaurant.  It was 400 kr, or about $8 CDN for a glass of light beer.  There were two people staying in the cabins by the river, but that was it.  They kept to themselves, leaving me to another exciting weekend evening in a microscopic town.
"
88,"The road got really rough when we turned off the highway onto the Thorsmork road.  It turned from tarmac into rough, loose gravel barely a kilometer in.  As I would have to ride the bike back along this road, I counted the number of streams I would have to cross, and tried to guess how deep they would be.  Fortunately, most of the streams looked shallow enough to barely get my ankles wet.  The only stream that might be a problem would be the last one we crossed, which was about knee deep, and fast moving.   We arrived at the main hut in the park.  I had read that there was another hut that was better, but it was about a kilometer away on the other side of a ridge.  The hut attendant gave me directions and said there were a few stairs en route.  From where I stood, the ridge did not look like it would be difficult to climb, even if I had to carry the bike part of the way. I packed my gear onto the bike, and started riding along a walking path.  Soon the path rose, and it became more difficult to ride.  It was amazing just how small the ridge looked when it was far away, and how big it became when I got close.   Then the stairs started.  A hundred steps was not much, but when you have to get a bike and 25 kg of gear to the top, it becomes much more of an exercise. From heaving panniers and bits of bicycle up the path, I discovered just how impractical panniers can be when they are not attached to a bike. Carrying panniers up steps was painfully slow and downright painful.  As panniers are designed to be attached onto racks, they become uncomfortable to carry for even short distances.   Additionally, you never seem to have enough hands to carry everything in one go.  To get everything to the top, I had to take several trips back and forth, going up twenty stairs at a time.  After what seemed like an hour, I made it to the top, and was able to see the other hut and in the background, the Thorsmork valley.  While others had said it was worth going to, that was all they really said.  I had no idea what to expect, and was struck by the rugged beauty of the valley.  I have seen much of the world, and the Thorsmork valley just blew me away. The hut was packed full of people when I arrived.  The caretaker, a young Icelander, found me a bed.  He said that there was a wedding on, but everyone was leaving in a few hours.  I chatted with some of the guests, and we decided to climb to the top of a local peak for a view. It was a relatively easy climb considering what I had been doing on the bike, and we relaxed at the top.  It was an incredible view.  Jagged volcanic peaks, glaciers, and fluffy clouds as far as you could see.      We returned back to the hut, where everyone packed up and left.   With nobody there but myself and the hut wardens, it was blissfully quiet.  The wardens were friendly and we shared a large bowl of shrimp salad that had been left behind by the wedding party.   After dinner, I tried to ride along one of the walking trails.  It would have been good to ride if the trail was not so steep and fragile, and the trail was wide enough for a bicycle pedal.  Best to stay walking in these parts.      The valley was still light at ten in the evening.  I climbed onto a small hill to watch the glacier change colours as the sun set.   Who needs television? After an hour, I headed back to the huts and fell asleep.
"
89,"  I walked along the river road, and into one of the numerous canyons.  Inside the canyon were small waterfalls, and lichen covered rocks.  Words cannot describe the beauty of this place and pictures do not even come close.    When I returned from my walk, it was early afternoon.  The IT group had not yet arrived.  We waited in anticipation, and polished off the last of the shrimp salad.  It was like waiting for a war to start.  In only a few hours, the peace of the valley would be broken by an unruly group of IT workers looking to blow off some steam.    By seven, the group had arrived.  They unpacked their designer luggage and a small distillery's worth of whiskey.  Soon, the party started.  As it was an IT company, the group had about twenty five men and three women.  I was in no mood for spending time with a bunch of drunk, type A IT people and headed for the hills for a bit of quiet.  At midnight, it was still light out, and the party had moved to a more distant hut.  I headed for bed while the warden went in search of two French partiers who decided to walk to the glacier on the other side of the valley.   "
90,"  I was let off by a waterfall near the Ring road.  Once off the tour 4x4, I was back on the ring road.  The sun was out, there was no breeze, and the scenery was spectacular.  Sharp hills covered in deep green grass, and glaciers peeking over the craggy peaks for thirty kilometers.    I rode to a small campsite off the Ring Road.  The campsite was in a volcanic valley, which really would have been good to go walking in if my knees were up to it.  Instead,  I spent the rest of the afternoon reading and watching the caretaker mow the lawn.  Not too exciting, but what can you do when you have limited health in a limited period of time?     "
91,"It was surprising how much the weather can change your perception.  The day before, the countryside was beautiful, and I was ecstatic about being able to ride.  With the overbearing clouds and pushy wind, the countryside did not look nearly as attractive.  This dampened my mood considerably, and made the riding feel more like a chore than a holiday. As I pedalled, the clouds thickened, and turned darker.  By the time I arrived at Skogar, the wind was now pushing 30 km/hr, and my helmet pinged from the occasional drop of rain. At Skogar I stopped for a quick bit of rest, and photo taking session.  I must admit that I was getting a bit tired of seeing waterfalls.  Even though the waterfall was large and impressive, it was just another waterfall, and I was getting cold and wet from the spray.  After an energy bar snack, I hopped back on the bike and headed towards Vik.       Back on the road, the wind continued to work against me.  It was slow riding, but not insurmountable.  I continued towards Vik.  The part of the coast where Vik was situated seemed to be clouded in precipitation.   As I got closer, the clouds started dropping that horrible misty rain.  I got progressively wetter, and then came to a 14% grade hill.  I was tired, soaked to the bone, facing a headwind, and a very steep hill.  A truly miserable experience. Through a combination of pushing and pedalling, I got to the top, and glided downhill for the remaining few kilometers to Vik.  It was only early afternoon when I arrived, but I was tired and soaked.  Rather than head to the campsite, I splurged on some sleeping bag accommodation at one of the local hotels. 1500 kr was more than I wanted to pay, but it was good to get out of the rain for a day, and get some heat.      There was nobody in the hotel except me and the cleaning girl.  She was an Icelandic Australian who had come to Iceland to work.  She told me about the island her mother had grown up on, and suggested that I go there to visit if I was in the area.  It was called Hrisey, and was near Akureyri, on the other side of Iceland.   After I had warmed up and dried off, I left the ghost hotel to see what was in Vik.  Like most every town in Iceland, it had a small folk museum.  The caretaker had nothing better to do, and gave me a personal tour of the museum.  After learning all about the difficulties of being an Icelander in the 1900's, I left to visit the beach and do a bit of shopping.      The beach in Vik had been called one of the ten best beaches in the world.  Clearly, whoever made the judgement did so on a sunny day.  There was not much to see in the misty rain, and I hardly felt like lying in the wet sand to relax.        Vik did not have much else to it.  A few houses, some warehouses, and a small textile factory for making sweaters.  I took a look in the factory shop, snuck a picture of the slaving Icelanders, and left.  Back at the hotel, there was still nobody around.  I was beginning to think that I was the only person in Vik.  Icelanders don't seem to walk much, and the town always looked empty.    With little else to do, I cooked up some pasta for dinner and enjoyed being dry and warm.  Perhaps the tommorrow would be better.
"
92,"About an hour later, we arrived at Skaftafell, which was one of Iceland's national parks.  Apart from a camp store, there really was not much else around.  The campsite was huge, and I chose a spot not too far from the toilet/shower.  Once I had set up camp, it was time to do a bit of exploring.  I walked to the glacier on the other side of the park for a quick look.  Glaciers are surprisingly colourful, if you have never seen one before.  The glacier was cracked and crusty, with stripes of dark sand crisscrossing the surface.  Not surprisingly, it was really cold and I soon had enough and wandered back to the campsite.     "
93,     
94,"  The first fifteen kilometers breezed by.   As I got out of the lava plain, the wind picked up drastically.  Suddenly, I was facing a 50 km headwind, with gusting crosswinds.  I continued plugging along, making slow, swerving progress.  Three and a half hours and 15 km later, I got swept off the road for the second time.    After picking up my bike and cleaning up the scrapes on my legs, I had to make a decision.  The last gust had been dangerous, and blown me off the road and into a ditch. What would have happened if the embankment had been higher?  The headwind showed no sign of abating, and the crosswinds still swelled unpredictably.   As a piece of debris zoomed past me and disappeared into the distance, I decided to call it quits.  My progress was too slow, and I thought I would be very likely to crash again.   After finding a spot where it would be easy for a vehicle to pull over, I parked the bike and sheltered myself behind my panniers.      While the wind howled past me, I watched the empty road for any sign of traffic.  Considering how few people lived in this part of Iceland, I expected to be waiting for some time.  After a half hour, a station wagon loaded with gear drove by.  The driver shrugged apologetically as he passed by.  Another car drove past a few minutes later, and soon became a dot in the distance.   After that, I started contemplating my options.  I had enough food to last a few days, but would I have enough time to get back to Rejkjavik?  Also, I had never tried to put up a tent in a 50 km/hr wind, and had visions of watching my tent fly off into the distance.   Completely unexpected, a station wagon came up the road from the opposite direction.  It drove up to me, and turned around.  It was the two men who had passed me earlier.  They had cleared out some space for me, and offered me a ride to Hofn. They were two Austrians on their way back to the ferry landing a few hundred kilometers north.  As we drove towards Hofn, the station wagon weaved from side to side in the crosswinds.  We stopped briefly at Jokulsarlon, otherwise known as the glacier lake. Jokulsarlon is a lagoon at the end of one of the countless glaciers in Iceland.  Here, shards of ice calve off the glacier and happily float until they melt.      It was a surreal place, and we spent some time watching the gull covered ice floes bob around.  But, being at the end of a glacier, it was really cold and windy.  We had enough, despite the scenery, and got back to the car. I thought about riding the rest of the way, but the wind had not died down at all. Given my on again off again knees, headwinds, and several scrapes that needed to be washed, I decided it was better to drive the remaining sixty kilometers.  Though not as harsh as the landscape to the south, the land was still striking. We drove along the highway, occasionally shifting from side to side from the gusting crosswinds.  Soon, we arrived in Hofn, the only town of note for hundreds of kilometers.        The campsite was well situated on a grassy field but far away from the local grocery store.  I rode around Hofn, which was very picturesque considering it was the only place of any size on the east coast.  I bought some very expensive groceries and returned to the campsite.        By the time I returned, clouds had covered the sky.  The wind never stopped.  A few more people were now at the campsite, and I had dinner with Christian, a German engineer on vacation.  He was planning on taking the bus the next day, and I decided to see what the morning would bring weatherwise. That night, if you could call it that, I lay awake and listened to the wind howling outside and rattling my tent.  It did not look good.
"
95,"The bus was little more than an oversized van, but somehow we fit my bike on it.  This was the only regular transport along the Eastern fjords, so my bike was kept company by freight packages and a sack of mail.  Christian and I took up a few seats in the back, and settled down for ride.  As I watched drops of rain strike the windshield, and flags get buffeted by the wind, it did not seem so wrong to be taking the bus.      As we motored further along the fjords, the weather turned sunny and the scenery turned even more spectacular.  My mood changed with the clouds.  Suddenly, it was frustrating to be on the bus, when I could be riding and deciding where I wanted to stop, rather than being at the mercy of the bus schedule.  As it was the mail truck as well as the passenger bus, we stopped at every settlement along the way, and detoured once or twice.    At one of the towns, the driver took his lunch break.  While I waited for the driver to return, I saw an Icelander get into his car, drive 200 m to the store, get some cigarettes, and drive back.  I used to think people in Canada were a bit too car dependent, but we've got nothing on Icelanders.      Eventually, we arrived in Egilstadir. At the campsite, I met two Dutch women with bicycles.  The thought of riding with somebody would be a welcome change, after all the miles I had logged on my own. It was strange to realize that they were the first cyclists I had met on the road since I started cycle touring.  (Note to self: if you want to ride with other people, try choosing places where other people want to ride)  They were just returning from the road to Myvatn.  One of them had suffered a bad case of sunstroke.  They turned around, and were now looking for a car to rent instead of riding bikes.  All of the sudden, my less than ideal knee situation was more ideal than I thought.  At least I was able to ride on occasion. To test out my knees, I tried to ride out to the ferry terminal, about twenty kilometers away.  Unfortunately, it was a 400 m climb, followed by a 600 m descent.  About three quarters of the way up, my knees started aching.   Rather than jeopardize the rest of the trip, I turned around and headed back to town.   There was not much to do, but I did visit the local museum where they had a display of Viking habitations.  There was another local football game on, where about half the town came to watch.  I think everyone was just happy to have a few days of good weather and enjoy the sunshine while it lasted. Christian and I hung out at the campsite for the rest of the day, eating large amounts of pasta and smoked salmon.  After waffling a bit, I decided to bus it to Myvatn.  The Dutch women had said the Icelanders were doing road work on the highway, and there was more than 20 km of loose gravel to contend with just outside of town. This was enough to convince myself to bus it.  My resolve to ride the ring was quickly eroding, and my time in Iceland was getting more precious. I had already entered the wuss zone by bussing it earlier, so another trip was not going to change anything.  Eh bien...
"
96,"The bus to Myvatn took only a few hours, and passed through a few hundred kilometers of deadly dull looking desert.  If there was one spot I was not sorry to be passing through in a vehicle, this was it.   Once we arrived, Christian and I walked to the campsite, and set up our tents on a bluff overlooking Myvatn and the surrounding area.    The town of Myvatn was not much of a town.  Apart from a few houses and some tourist facilities there was not much to the place.  After picking up some supplies, I headed back to the campsite for R&R.  Today I would stay off the bike, and do nothing but rest.    As I lay in the tent, I heard the sound of rain, but could not see any drops.  Looking outside, I realized that the sound was that of clouds of flies colliding with my tent. The flies were everywhere.  Fortunately, they were not the biting kind.  Not surprisingly, Myvatn translates to midge lake.  I lay down in the everlasting light, and let the gentle drumming of colliding midges lull me to sleep.
"
97,"The morning's weather was not great.   Clouds filled the sky as far as we could see.  There was a volcano en route that was supposed to offer great views.  But, we skipped it, as it was enshrouded in a bank of cloud.   We set off along the lake road, riding just a bit faster than the midges. The lava rocks formed strange rolling lumps in the surrounding countryside, and made very eerie looking islands in the lake.   Just as we arrived in the parking lot to Dimmuborgir, Christian snapped the chain on his bike.  Fortunately,  I had my tool kit with me, and a some spare chain links.  At last, I could actually use something from my tool kit.  I quickly fixed his chain, and we went into the rock forest. It was terribly disappointing.  Because it was cloudy, the rocks looked rather flat and boring.  However, one rock called the cathedral was very impressive, despite the weather.    We continued around the lake, stopping every now and then for photos and a chance to rest my knees.  The midges continued to swarm us at every opportunity.  About ten kilometers out of Myvatn, we saw a backpacker walking along the highway with a cloud of midges and a very perturbed look on his face.  I did not have the heart to tell him that it was going to be a long way to town.        Back at the campsite, I felt good enough to ride to Husavik.  This town is one of the most northerly spots in Iceland, and known for whale watching.  It was only about 60 km, and I felt fine.  Christian said he would meet me there, as he would take the bus. After yet another meal of pasta and smoked salmon, I headed back to my tent for some rest.  It was cooler than the day before, and cloudy.  The midges must have gone to bed early, as there were no clouds surrounding my tent.  Just the ever present gusts of wind.
"
98,"Before heading to Husavik, I went to see some volcanic hot pools near Myvatn.  I left early in the morning, and rode ten kilometers over what seemed to be a much steeper hill than I had remembered.  No wonder drivers never tell you about hills.  The sky was cloudy, and the pools spouted out plumes of stinking, sulphurous fumes.  Somebody had told me about a crazy tourist who ducked into a plume, only to find out the steam was hot and acidic enough to melt holes in his gortex jacket.  This made me a bit more careful about getting too close to the vapour plumes, but I sometimes think it was another tourist legend.  After a half hour of walking around, it was time to return and make my way to Husavik.        After getting back to the campsite, I quickly packed up my gear and got ready to leave.  With my luck, it was going to take all day to ride the 60 km to Husavik.  It was sunny as I left, but wisps of clouds were blowing in from the north.  I would be facing a headwind all the way there.  I climbed the hill out of Myvatn towards Husavik as the clouds grew in number.  Once I got onto the plateau, the clouds covered the sky, and in some parts, the ground.  The headwind was much more manageable than other times.  As I rode further from the lake, all the green that had surrounded Myvatn was replaced by rocks and dirt.  It was very desolate riding along the now dirt road, with the wind blowing and brown stretches of hills as far as I could see.  About the only traffic I saw was the bus that was taking Christian to Husavik.  He waved at me as I plodded along the road, fighting the wind and a slight uphill grade.         The weather grew worse the further north I went.  Soon, the clouds blanketed the plateau, and I found myself getting soaked in that horrible misty rain that seems to permeate through all known fabrics.  However, I plodded onwards, determined to make it to Husavik, if only to get out of the rain.  It got a bit easier as I peaked the last crest and started a slow downhill.  As I got closer to the coast, the desolate, windblown moonscape turned into green pastureland.  I passed the occasional hotel and restaurant, and thought about calling it quits, but decided that I would continue en route and actually ride to where I wanted to go, for a change.  Two days in a row on busses was enough.    When I arrived in Husavik, Christian was there to congratulate me for being dumb enough to ride on a terribly damp and misty day.  There was not much to Husavik at all.  It was also very cold.  Considering that it was very close to the Arctic Circle, I should not have been surprised.  According to the campsite manager, it had snowed only a few weeks before.  He gleefully pointed to some pictures of snow covered Husavik, and said that this was not uncommon in the summer. There were about ten people at the campsite, and we all crowded into the kitchen to eat and stay warm.  It was good to meet other people from around the world, but most of all it was good to have some heating.  Northern Iceland does not get very warm, even at the height of summer.      Christian and I went on a whale watching tour that evening.  A strange experience, as we left at eight in the evening and chugged around the ocean in daylight conditions.  It was exciting to see minke whales, but the terribly cold and damp conditions made much of the tour err cold and damp.      We ambled back to the campsite in the stunningly bright light at 10 in the evening.  Everyone had already hit their tents, and I could almost hear the collective shivering.   For me, after an unusual day of riding, I was too tired to shiver, and fell asleep soon after crawling into my sleeping bag.   "
99,"Against my better judgement, I stopped along the way to visit the folk museum and the sod roofed houses.  This was another of countless museums, and I was growing weary of learning just how hard it was to live in Iceland.  Next time, I'll just somebody's word for it.    About ten kilometers later, my fine day of tailwinds and flat terrain turned into a giant switchback for several kilometers.  It was about 300 m climb to the top, but felt like much more.  Once at the top, I could see Godafoss in the distance, and downhill too!  I raced down the highway in the sun, braking only when I got to the turnoff to the falls.   There was a small guesthouse with a campsite by the falls.  The owner had just opened up, and services like hot water were unavailable.  Luckily for me, but more so for others, he let me use his shower to wash off the buildup of dirt and sweat. After washing up, I took a look at Godafoss.  It was a good set of falls, despite my ambivalence towards falling water that had mysteriously developed in Iceland. Apart from the falls, there was very little to see in the area, and very little in terms of settlement.        With little else to do, and nobody around,  I cooked some pasta for dinner,and read a bit before turning in for the evening.  By now, the night was not even pretending to come, and it never seemed to get close to dark.  But, I had adapted to the lack of darkness, and had no trouble falling asleep.
"
100,"    At the top, I unexpectedly went Buddhist, and decided to make a rock cairn to mark my passage.  After doing the obligatory three circles around the cairn, I started the easy downhill to the coast.  It was frighteningly steep, but exhilarating to descend so quickly.  As I dropped down the highway, I struck a pocket of arctic air, and it suddenly got cold and foggy.   By the time I got to the bottom, I was feeling hypothermic, and glad to start pedalling again.      The fjord that housed Akureyri was beautifully green, with snow topped mountains.  I rode the last few kilometers into town, and made my way to the campsite.  It was the best equipped campsite I had been to.  There was a kitchen and meeting area and a huge green lawn to pitch tents.  The site was mostly empty, except for three or four tents.   I met another cyclist at the campsite.  Two cyclists in two days!  This was unprecedented in my limited experience.  Perhaps I should go to places where people actually want to cycle like Iceland, rather than an obscure desert in Oman.  The cyclist was an English man who had been making very good time around the island.  He had caught tailwinds most of the time, and had relatively sunny days for riding.  I must have been just a day or two into an arctic front.  He was leaving for Rejkjavik the next day, and I wanted to stay in Akureyri for at least a day.  I would be riding solo again. He did tell me where to find a cheap (by Icelandic standards at least) place to buy food, and some suggestions about what to see in the town.  The grocery store was about a kilometer away, and it seemed better to walk there rather than ride.  I took a detour through downtown Akureyri, but that did not take long.  Akureyri was not a big place.    When I got back from the store, the empty campsite had transformed into the teenage party from hell.  It was the long weekend, and every teenager from Rejkjavik had escaped the big smoke for a weekend of drunken debauchery.  The site was packed full of tents, camper vans, and daddy's car.   At dinner, I hung out with the other non Icelandic tourists in the kitchen, while drunk teenagers invited us to farms that they worked at in the summer.  After a half an hour of slowly degenerating pronunciation, we decided that alcohol soaked, teenage conversations were not all that interesting, and headed into town for some alcohol soaked, touristic conversations instead.  We walked down along the main drag, where Iceland's finest hotrodders were proudly driving up and down the road with stereos blaring, and engines revving.   Because the drinking age in bars is strictly enforced in Iceland, the teenagers have nothing to do except cruise the main drag and look for other teenagers who could not get into bars. Being Friday night and a holiday weekend, most of the bars had lineups.  Eventually, we found a bar that had no lineup, and went inside for a beer.  As this was Iceland, a solitary beer was about all that we could afford on our limited budgets.  A French traveller, in an attempt to save some money, ordered a glass instead of a pint.  This cost him 500 kr, instead of the 600 kr that we paid for a pint.   We left the bar at midnight, into the bright light of the barely setting sun.  It was totally disconcerting (and certainly not because of the beer) to step out of the bar into daylight.  When we arrived at the campsite, the party was in full force, with drunken Icelanders singing and swaying, and car stereos blaring out a din of unidentifiable music. I still managed to get to sleep, despite the noise, and wondered about what to do the next day.
"
101,"It was cloudy when I left, with a bit of a headwind.  As I rode along the highway, I caught up with the Englishman.  He was setting a very good pace, considering he was fullen laden, and all I had was a daypack.   We split ways a few kilometers later.  The way to Hrisey went along the fjord, through green pastured fields dotted with white farmhouses.  It was a veritable metropolis compared with the north of Iceland.  As I rode, the clouds melted away to reveal a truly stunning fjord.        A few hours later, I arrived at the ferry terminal.  It was a small ferry, but well maintained.  I started talking with one of the locals en route.  He was a local artist who, amongst other things, was a bicycle riding clown.  He suggested a few things to see on Hrisey, and then paid for my ferry passage.  Who says that Icelanders are unfriendly? Hrisey itself was a small island, with a nature sanctuary at the north end.   I met an Icelandic tourist there, who managed to talk the sanctuary caretaker into letting us go up to the lighthouse for a view.  It was a beautiful walk through a sunny field of purple flowers waving in the wind.        The Icelander and I talked about all sorts of things, like the temperament of Icelanders, and the future of the land.  He was a school teacher who wanted to see his own country, unlike most of the people in Iceland, and most of the people in the world.      After walking back to town, he bade me goodbye, and I went to the east side of the island to look at some birds and cliffs.  The east side was just as beautiful and peaceful as the west side.  I wanted to stay longer but had to catch the ferry back.  By now, it was almost four, but seemed like I had been on the island only a few minutes.      After catching the ferry back, I rode back to town.  With the wind now at my back, it was really easy riding, and only took two hours to ride the 60 km.  As I rode closer to town, the clouds blocked the sun, and my mood dampened.  Would the party still be on?  Would I get any sleep? When I returned, my worst fears had been realized.  The party was going more strongly than before, and all the travellers from the night before had packed up and left.  I was alone in a sea of drunken teenagers.  Trying to put off the inevitable, I went to the botanical gardens for some quiet.  There, you can find all sorts of strange plants growing thousand of miles further north than you would ever expect.  However, there is only so long you can spend in a garden. I headed back to the campsite crawled back into my tent.  The noise of dueling car stereos thumped away outside, while I chewed on a smoked salmon sandwich.  And then, I heard it.  Music that I liked.  Not that Euro-pop club music, but some grungy, angst driven riffs.   I crawled out of my tent, walked over  and introduced myself, mentioning how good it was to hear some music I liked.  Soon, I found myself drinking beer and whiskey with some already inebriated Icelanders.  They were mostly finishing university and on the way to bigger and better things. After polishing off half of Iceland's GDP in booze, we decided to weave downtown, where we had zero luck getting into any nightclubs.  It was totally disconcerting to be waiting in line for a club in broad daylight.  Eventually, we found a bar to go into, which was somewhat crowded yet dull.   Haug and Ziggy and I got bored, and headed back to the campsite.  Fully inebriated, we spotted a handball net and decided it was a good time to test our handball skills.  This seemed perfectly decent to me, despite the fact that I had never played before, or even had any idea about rules.  Needless to say,  I won't be making the Icelandic handball team any time soon. After losing badly in the shootout, we decided to head home.  Eventually, we stumbled back to the camp, where the party was still going strong.  By now, the alcohol had sucked all the energy out of me.  I crawled into my bed to watch the tent spin a bit, before falling asleep.
"
102,"There was plenty of space on the 8:30 bus.  We drove out of Akureyri and headed south towards Rejkjavik.  The scenery was not quite as spectacular as the east coast, but beautiful all the same.  It was early afternoon when we arrived, and cloudy with that ever present wind.   Rejkjavik would not be high on anyone's list for architectural wonders.  I rode past some pretty non descript buildings on my way to the campsite, and marvelled at the urban sprawl that you could get with such a small population. The campsite was huge, even compared to the one in Akureyri.  Once I had set up, I ran into Petra, who had been in Hofn at the same time as me.  She was getting ready to start working as a tour guide for some German tourists but had a few days to kill before they arrived. While we were sitting at one of the picnic tables, another cyclist rolled in.  His name was Coomb, and was on an extended trip to the windiest, most expensive countries in the world.  I thought he was crazy. Not surprisingly, we got along just fine.  He had come from Ireland and Scotland, and was on his way to Norway.   It was a quiet evening for all of us.  None of us had the energy to go downtown, so we stayed at the campsite, generally doing nothing except trying to stay warm.
"
103,"There were all sorts of celebrations on, with free concerts from some of Iceland's most popular bands.  Sadly, Bjork did not show here lovely face.  After a day of wandering throughout, we were cold and exhausted, and broke.  We headed back to the campsite to get some sleep.
"
104,"I woke in the morning to the gusting of wind.  Once again, the wind had picked up, and was gusting 30 km/hour in the wrong direction.  Thingvellir would have to wait another day. Coomb and I spent the day hanging out in cafes, buying groceries and tuning bicycles.  While happily relaxing at the campsite, another traveller came up to talk to me.  He was an American on his first bicycle tour, and sought my advice on the subject.  He had arranged to rent a bike and panniers and was now looking for any helpful hints.  'Don't ride into a headwind' was my answer.  I advised him not to leave today, as the wind was gusting and likely to be dangerous.  He mentioned his lack of time (being an American on holiday) and said he wanted to give it his best shot.   As such, he wandered off to pick up his bike.   When he returned with the bike, he said that there was nowhere to rent panniers, so he would improvise.  Unfortunately, he had to wear his 70 l pack on his back, and pack whatever else he had onto the rear rack.  It did not look good. To further compound difficulties, the wind picked up to 40 km/hour, and gusts of 50 km/hr.  I told him about my incident out east, and suggested he wait for a better day to start.  However, he had limited time, and was determined to make a go of it.  I had to admire his tenacity, as he pedalled off towards the east. About four hours later, he returned, slightly bruised and battered.  He had done the same thing as me, and had been blown off the road by a vicious crosswind.  He would leave the next day.
"
105,"Rather than take the straight and fast main roads, I took the bike path out of Rejkjavik.  The city has been trying to encourage more bike riding by building paths throughout the center.  There were not many bikes on the path, and I rode in peace to the outskirts of the city.  The path twisted through parks on its way out of town. Because the path was not as direct as the main roads, it took about an hour to get out of Rejkjavik.  With my lousy tourist map, I found the turnoff to the pipeline road and started riding.   The pipeline road follows a pipeline north of Rejkjavik to a steam fissure.  At first, the going was pretty dull.  Just flat brown fields and the occasional interesting rock. As the day went on, the road went into a canyon of twisted, colourful rock formations and fissures.  I passed the steam generation plant, which looked like something out of a James Bond movie, with silver coloured geodesic domes and pipes running all over the place.  Unfortunately, I lost my roll of film for this part of the trip, so you'll have to go there yourselves to see it.  (not easy to get to, but highly recommended). After getting out of the gorge, the road dropped down towards Thingvallavatn (the lake), where I enjoyed the extended downhill.  I rode along the edge of the lake, through more pastures and fields until I arrived in Thingvellir. Thingvellir was the original seat of power in Iceland, where the local chiefs met once a year to discuss politics.  This spot also marks the divide between tectonic plates, and roughly divides North America from Europe.  As one of the more important historic and geographic sites in the country, there were plenty of services, including a free tour. I arrived too late for the free tour, so I set up my tent and called it a day.  By this point, smoked salmon was starting to be more of a chore than a delicacy, but I laboured on to finish another smoky fishy meal.  There were a few other people at the camp, but we did not socialize much, mostly because of the icy wind that was blowing from the north.  I took an early night call, and headed for bed.
"
106,"The tour actually turned out to be very informative.  I learned lots of things about the area, including the strange properties of a certain spring that never froze,  and more about Icelandic sagas and their connection with this part of the country.  It almost made me feel like reading some Icelandic sagas, until I found out just how convoluted they could be.  Perhaps another time. After the tour, I headed back to the campsite for another meal of smoky fish and carbohydrates.  After lunch, I still had the afternoon to kill, and a walk would be just the thing.  It was still cloudy, but not raining yet.  A walk on a cloudy day was infinitely better than waiting around in my tent. As I was walking out of the campsite, I heard somebody call my name.  It was Coen, who had just arrived.  He was just finishing a coffee, and preparing to leave, as there was nobody in the campsite, and it looked like a deathly dull place to spend a day. Of course, with the two of us, it was instant comic relief, and smart ass humour.  It was not surprising why we were the only ones in Thingvellir.  Everyone heard our banter packed up and left for somewhere quieter with higher quality entertainment. We spent the afternoon riding around Thingvellir, trying to decide where North America ended and Europe began.  With the overcast skies, the land seemed flatter and more dull, yet somewhat mysterious.  Low lying clouds blanketed the nearby volcanos, making the land seem claustrophobic. We finished the day with yet another meal of rice, soup mix, and whatever vegetables happened to survive the trip.  By this time, I was really craving a meal where you could cut something with a knife and fork.  I resolved to hit the buffet when I got back to Rejkjavik.
"
107,"We rode back to Rejkjavik along the main highway.  It was a good day, with a tailwind, and isolated patches of sun.  Not nearly as nice as the pipeline road, but the scenery still made the ride enjoyable.  By mid afternoon, we were back in Rejkjavik, and ready for the weekend.
"
108,"On one of those days, I went to visit the penis museum.  Somebody in Rejkjavik had taken the trouble to collect specimens from all sorts of different animals, and put them on display for tourists willing part with large amounts of kroner.  While the concept was interesting enough for a museum, the novelty wore off pretty quickly. About the only other thing worthy of note was our attempt to eat haakol.  During a fit of madness, Coen had mentioned he wanted to try haakol, which was the Icelandic name for fermented shark meat.  We purchased some in the fish market and headed back to the campsite for a taste.   It did not look too bad.  Just some small chunks of off white, translucent flesh.   Of course, the smell was less than desirable.  We stared at the small dish of haakol with some trepidation, wondering if this really was worth it.  Of course, seeing as we had gone to the trouble of hunting it down in the market, it would be pure cowardice, not to mention a complete waste of time, to back down now.   Petra watched our hesitation and took a small cube, popped it in her mouth, and started chewing.  The smile on her face suddenly changed to a look of distress, followed by squinting disgust.  She seemed to instantaneously disappear from the table, and reappear at the tap, gulping water in between gags. Coen was next, taking a smaller piece, and doing exactly the same thing.  I took just a sliver, and soon found myself under the tap, trying to get the taste out of my mouth.  There is not really a good way to describe the taste, except to say that it is just like you would expect a piece of rotten fish to taste like. I've come to the conclusion that you can guess to how close a culture has come to starvation by the foods they choose as delicacies.  My guess about haakol is that a ravenous Viking came across a rotting shark carcass on a beach somewhere, and said 'It beats starving to death '   My last day in Iceland was spent getting my bike packed, and doing more touristy things like visiting buffets and free museums.  Iceland has a surprising amount of culture for a city of 150,000 people.
"
109,"To further annoy me, in the interest of free enterprise, baggage carts were not free, but needed to be rented for $3 USD.   This was an extortionate price to pay to move my baggage all of 50 m.  Out of principle, I refused to rent the cart, and pushed all my gear towards the check point.  I vowed never to transit through the US again, if there was any other way around.  Sorry, Mr. Bush, your country's policies are just too restrictive for me to want to visit anymore.   At least I did not have to spend seven hours in the Minneapolis airport on the way back.  Thankfully, the layover was short, and I headed away from America and back into Canada.  The rest of the flight was uneventful, and I arrived back home, slightly poorer and weatherbeaten than before.
"
110,"This trip did not work out as I had planned.  Though Montezuma usually comes on vacation with me, this time Murphy tagged along much of the way.  Bad knees, bad weather and bad exchange rates made this trip more of a challenge than others.  However, had the wind been blowing the right way, or my knees worked properly, it would have been much more enjoyable. Scenery  There's no place like it anywhere that I've been, and I've been to lots of places.  Nothing is as harsh, or stunningly beautiful as Iceland on a sunny day.       Roads The paved roads were fine, with little traffic once outside of Rejkjavik.  The gravel roads were the killers.  As there are few bicyclists in Iceland, gravel roads do not get flattened the same way they do in other countries.  With mostly vehicular traffic, they tend to get washboarded, making riding along them a very slow and unpleasant experience. The constant vibration popped out my bike computer along one of these roads, and I believe the road roughness was partially responsible for hurting my knees.  Infrastructure If you stay in Rejkjavik, there are a few stores with both mountain and road bike parts.  However, there is not much outside Rejkjavik for cyclists.  Bike stores are next to impossible to find outside Rejkjavik, and cyclists should carry spares and tools.  Should you need to take a bus, it is usually an extra 500-1000 kroner for the bike.  This is a fixed fare, so it pays to go long distances with a bike.   Costs Exchange at the time was 1 CDN=55kr Iceland was terribly expensive.  It was questionable whether it was more economical to take a bike or bus, because increased food consumption quickly ate up any savings on transport.  I budgeted about 2500 kroner/day  for cooking myself and camping, and found that this was not sufficient.  Campgrounds were anywhere from 300-700 kr/night, and a pack of biscuits might be 200 kroner.  Surprisingly enough, smoked salmon was the best value, as it was about 2000 kr/kg, which was only twice as much as salami.  For all you lager louts out there, the cheapest pint I found was 400 kr and usually a pint was between 500-600 kr.  It is not surprising that Icelanders go to other countries when they want to drink. Weather This is the most unpredictable aspect in Iceland.  One day it can be sunny and still, and the next day there might be a 50 km headwind and that horrible misty rain that soaks you to the bone.  I met cyclists who took two days to ride the 50 km from the airport to Rejkjavik because of headwinds.  It is important to budget extra time for bad weather, because there will be days when it is impossible to cycle. Before Iceland, I used to think that I could handle any type of weather.  Iceland can change that mindset very quickly. So, to sum up,  Iceland hass some of the most spectacular countryside in the world, but you will have to work for it.  This is not a place I would recommend to anybody for their first cycle tour, because the weather can turn nasty in the blink of an eye.  While most of the roads are not very hilly (warning: I live in a mountainous area)  prevailing winds can make your life miserable if you are heading in the wrong direction.  Take lots of money, and a rugged bike, as a road racer will die a slow and painful death on the dirt roads.  And most importantly, don't get injured at the start of the trip.
"
111,"  The idea started when the opportunity came to go to Italy or England with my wife who was going to a conference. (I'm a counsellor at The University of Queensland and my wife is a lecturer in Education at the same university.) While surfing around on the net to check out possibilities the words ""bike"" and ""tour"" came up so, like Alice diving into the rabbit hole, I jumped in and discovered a new world of crazy characters and wonderful places.  What did people do before the net?? The links to bike sites began to grow alarmingly and each page was a discovery of people doing their own thing..and the wonderful thing about all these people was that they wanted to share their excitement and their discoveries with everyone. They had discovered a world that was still adventurous. The jaded worldview as seen through the lens of a TV camera was replaced by pleasure and expectation in the new and unusual. I wanted in on this trip. Another bike touring tragic was born. Michelin Maps, The Lonely Planet Guide to Cycling in France and the internet became familiar over the next few months. Reading the journals posted by others on the internet was like being offered the choice of 100 ice cream flavours - tantalising and demoralising at the same time because you can only choose one.They all looked scrumptious. And then..lo and behold, someone mentioned that The Tour de France was on at the same time. I had a focus and a reason to be in one place at one time so the task became simply to work outwards from my choice of venue. That venue was Alpe de Huez. I had a date I had to start and finish by and a date to view the Tour. The route started to fall into place   "
112,"   Oh and just to add to the excitement,we purchased an avocado farm and started climbing the mountain of knowledge about avos.   "
113,"  My contact with England deserves a chapter of its own but it has little to do with cycling and more to do with an awesome experience of seeing pictures, songs, movies and images which had been imprinted in my brain over many years and from thousands of kilometres away come to life.   London was something else: The impression I had was of entering the pages of a history book and actually seeing things that had only existed as words or pictures in a book. While knowing that all those places were real it wasn't until I could see them that they actually existed.  Just the names evoked the ""Wow, I'm really here factor."": Picadilly, British Museum, Waterloo, London Bridge etc etc... What a place and what an experience to finally meet my cultural roots. London - what a great city. ""If a person becomes bored with London ,they're bored with life."" The new laws which charge motorists for entering Central London have made bicycles a reasonably common mode of transport for many but it still looked dangerous to me. I kept my bike in its bag and used buses.
"
114,"     All the bits come together and, at last, after months and months of planning and poring over maps and eager anticipation, we're off on our trip...and get promptly lost trying to find the bike path down from the airport to the city. Eventually I reasoned that Geneva was on a lake and as long as we headed downhill we'd get there..and we did. We find accommodation in the youth hostel. It's cheap and has breakfast and is in an ideal location in the city by the lake. Geneva oozes wealth and history. I feel like I'm on a WWII movie set with old trolleys and narrow streets. The promenade in the evening is alive with people and activity and makes a great place to eat dinner on the grass and watch people watching people. There's a nice feel to this place. Checked out the Palais de Nations from a distance and note a few military types roaming around with guns. That's different. I'm not too sure what Cherie thinks about making this trip with her old man as as her feelings remain almost as hidden as mine. I know I feel very happy to share this with my daughter but, as usual, can't express it directly to her.  Cherie is quite used to this hostel lifestyle but sharing a room with 4 other strangers is new to me. They could be serial killers for all I know. Still, we retire early (for Europe I was to discover) and I don't even hear the other killers come into the room at night and they're still asleep by the time we leave in the morning. A quick trip around old Geneva on our bikes then off to the train station for a trip to Grenoble.
"
115,"A visit to the bike shop in the train station gets us directions out of Grenoble but doesn't prevent us from getting lost again. We stop to buy a baguette, some cheese, drinks and fruit for what will become our standard lunch fare for the next two weeks and have lunch by the river.   Then at last we're actually on our real bike journey. We can see the mountain we have to go over to get to our day's destination, Villard de Lans. It gets bigger and bigger as we get closer and then it goes on and on and on, up and up and up. Granny gears get heavy use. The day is hot, the hill is long and the ""Bon Courage"" yells from other cyclists merely emphasises that we are struggling. I occasionally stop thinking of my own misery and feel sorry for Cherie who really hasn't had a chance to train for this. However, she goes on uncomplainingly and her ability to just plod on will continue to amaze me as the days go on. I'm very proud of her.   Finally we reach the top and make one of the most memorable and pleasant discoveries on our journey through France - each village will usually have a fountain with 'Eau Potable' water trickling out of an ancient spout..This fountain is the first of many that supply us with beautiful,cool water in nearly every village we pass through. The fountains are my choice as an icon of our trip - ancient stonework,quirky,French,cool,reviving,remarkable.   35 kilometres and 4 hours later we're reach our campsite. Cherie speaks a little French and this will help us in countless ways as the days go on. Villard de Lans is a real mountain village with ski fields all around it in winter. For us it is a postcard image come to life.      Visions I've only seen in movies or in pictures are right there and we are in the picture. Remarkable!  The next day we head off around a fantastic road through the mountains, across hanging valleys and down into a village clinging to a cliff face.   This is a 'don't miss it' area. A great place to bike, we see a large group of Americans trundle by on their bikes.  I think I prefer the small, self supported way myself.   A beautiful area but many villages and roadside signs tell of another age when partisans were fighting the Nazis here and ordinary citizens were being killed in retaliation. They form a sharp focus in a background of splendour. It's so hard to believe that people could do that to each other.           "
116,"Borg de Oisans is absolutely humming with cyclists and other people drawn to watch a mountain stage of Le Tour.  Bikes, people, groups, traffic - madness in what I presume is a quiet, little village 99.9% of the time. Finding a campsite is interesting.  We roll into a grassy area with tents packed everywhere. We look around for the office but are informed by a camper that there is none, he just camped where other people were. So, tripping over tent ropes and bicycles we squeeze into the last patch of green. We discover that we are camped on a grassy knoll outside the village swimming pool so use the facilities to cool down and have a shower.     A stroll around the village later reveals that people camp wherever there is a bare patch of ground - parks, spare blocks of land , roadside verges - anywhere. How French!   The night is punctuated by the cacophony of sirens (claxons?)as police and motorbikes stream by and head up the mountain.  Early the next morning more sirens, buses, police and support vehicles overtake the traffic jam. The atmosphere is becoming increasingly tense and the excitement starts to spill out. Time to head up our first big col.  What a trip!   Bikes, people, dogs, cars, vans, kids - all heading up the mountain or lining the side of the road prepared to wait all day for a glimpse of the Tour.   We cruise in low and stop to take pictures and rest.     People stream by going both up and down.       After 3 hours we make the top only to find the last few metres are closed for the finish chute of the Tour.   The village on top is crammed with people and after a crushing and lengthy wait to buy Le Tour souvenirs we head back down to find a spot for watching the wierd and wonderful array of spectators make their way up..    "
117,"We find a shady spot up the side of a steep embankment and retreat to cool off.   The side of the mountain is scattered with tents and blankets where people have stayed overnight. The next 6 hours is spent watching people streaming up and down the mountain.  We are just up from the crazy Dutch supporters who keep chanting and dancing all day to the beat of a big boom box.   They form a gauntlet along the road and douse people and themselves with water at every opportunity.   Then the Caravan arrives.  It's a motley collection of cars, trucks, tractors with advertising signs and displays.    Spectators grab the freebies that are thrown from the floats.   I manage to grab a prized sachet of instant coffee which still sits proudly on the shelf meaning nothing to anyone but me. Hey, I was there it tells me. The caravan signals that the cyclists are not far behind and the tension starts to build.   Then helicopters can be seen further below us in the valley. They're the TV helicopters at the head of the race so it won't be long now. More police zip up the road clearing the path, Team cars start to zoom up the the road. I don't know what an invasion is like but that's what it seems like to me as each wave of officials scouts ahead and clears the way for the following wave until, finally a roar of cheers can be heard flowing up the mountain and then flashing lights of a car signals the lead cyclist is coming.    The crowd moves across the road to get a glimpse down the road. There's just a mass of people spread across the road all looking downhill. Then, it's as if Moses has returned and the crowd splits. The crowds open and close in sequence to reveal a lone cyclist smoothly pedalling his way up the hill. The leader gets a cheer and disappears into the distance.   Then the rest of the cylcists start streaming up.   Lance is spotted. Virenque is there. It's amazing to be so close to these champions.   The peleton struggles up and then the stragglers slowly grind up.           We start to make our way down and spot the 'red light' rider bringing up the rear.  He gets a bigger cheer than the leader because he's got nothing to ride for but he's not giving up.   What a day! A dream come true to be here. A day more fascinating and engaging than I thought it would be. If you get a chance, don't miss it.

118," We look for lockers to store our panniers so we can travel a bit lighter but, alas, a sign says that because of the danger of terrorist bombs the lockers are no longer in use.  We also come across our first beggars who seem to be very professional in their begging so I assume that it's a career choice and not because of some misfortune on their part. The whole family descend on the train station and split up to take their positions. They don't hassle us so I suppose they know backpacks and bikes represent poor pickings. The teleferique has some okay views and the bastille is also okay but nothing really to be awestruck by.  Like every train we ride, there's other cyclists getting on too. Orange is not a bike friendly station and bikes have to be carried down and up steps.  I leave my bike and help another cyclist carry his down the steps and he just wheels it away through the tunnel. I go back and carry mine down the steps by myself. The fellowship of the road does seems a bit scarce I do think.   Orange has a Roman Theatre that should not be missed.    It's a great place to wander around with an excellent earphone commentary explaining everything.   This is my first close up experience with something directly from the Romans and it's a truley awesome thing to be in a place that was built so long ago.   My high school ancient history texts were really based on something tangible that I can now touch and feel.   Wow! Europeans are probably very blase' about ruins and ancient history but coming from a place that has had only 200 years of European history, it's mind boggling stuff.   We plan on cycling out to Vaison la Romaine to rest for a day before heading up Mt Ventoux and over to Provence. We cycle through vineyards on a narrow backroad heading towards Vaison la Romaine.    The cars are fast and furious but don't seem to be surprised by a couple of cyclists and give us wide berths. Unlike Australian drivers, French drivers know what a cyclist is because they probably ride a bike sometime.  Australians motorists seem so surprised to see a cyclist that they instinctively draw in closer to see what's going on and then, realising that it's actually a highly vulnerable human competing for their road space, either panic and beep their horn or see if they can intimidate the cyclist by maintaining a straight course within millimetres of the handlebar. It never ceases to amaze me that some Australian drivers seem to view the white centre line as absolutely untouchable so rather than move out around the cyclist and across the centre line they try to squeeze past the defenseless cyclist - and not another car in sight! ""Must not touch that white line"". French drivers on the other hand nonchalantly cross the middle line whether there is a car coming or not. The car approaching from the other direction knows what's happening and doesn't get too excited either - just moves over a bit. Enough about the car drivers.. The first camping area was full so we were forced to keep on peddling into the evening until we found another park. A long day to Vaison la Romaine but the village is a special place.          The next day was a scheduled rest day so we enjoyed the sights, smells and sounds of the village Market day     Then we head off to visit another village called Seguret which was listed as one of France's most beautiful villages.  How could we resist? ..and it deserved the listing. Talk about picture postcard material.   I'm sure Europeans are as blase' about their villages as Australians are about our beaches and open spaces.    It sometimes takes an outsider to really appreciate the beauty of what locals see as just commonplace. On the way back we learnt the limitations of our maps because we got lost trying to cut through a forest road to another small village.  Trudging up hills too steep and rocky to cycle and then up again and again, we went further into the woods. No signs and no idea where we were..and nobody else around. Surely, we reasoned there must be something around the next corner - or over the next hill. Nothing but more hills, rocks, dust and heat.  Eventually we reached a long downhill section that beckoned us on but, wisely, we decided to backtrack, pick up our fallen pride and go back the way we had come. If we went down that hill chances are we would find nothing and we'd then have to go all the way back up another hill. The rest day had turned into a hot, miserable, exhausting slog. Even Cherie with her remarkable calm and accepting ways was getting annoyed. However, a pizza at night and a glass of wine and a snooze in the tent ended another long and unexpectedly difficult day.
"
119," A pleasant morning's ride and the climb begins. It soon dawned on me at least that this was, indeed, going to be a challenge but an early start, a granny gear and plenty of stops for 'photo opportunities' saw us slowly ascend this icon. It's a pleasant visual ascent through pine forests and with the occasional long range view out over the plains of Provence. The number of cyclists ascending was amazing and it was obvious that this hill held some special meaning to European cyclists. It was obviously a lifetime dream for many as they slogged on up to the top. There were family groups, individuals, groups, tourists, the old and the young. A van pulled up on the roadside and a woman and kids piled out to look back down the road for 'Papa' who got his photo taken, a cheer and a shout of encouragement as he cycled on by. Good onya Pop! Wonder of wonders Cherie and I actually passed a cyclist on a road bike! (This would be the first and last time this would happen) He wheezed and grunted up even more slowly than us, stopped, gasped got back on his bike and kept going. He was here for glory and nothing was going to stop him. I hope I don't have to give him mouth to mouth rescuscitation.     The top of Mont Ventoux is instantly recognisable and is a perfect finale for a tough hike up a classic col.     As if to add to the drama of the climb, as we emerge above the treeline and cycle through the rocky terrain, the weather changes and it begins to get cold and wet. The wind, the rain, the scudding clouds of fog enveloping the road, the patches of blue sky and the amzing landscape are a perfect climax to an incredible climb. Well done Mt Ventoux!   It confirms that warnings about being prepared for the weather are to be taken seriously. Finally the top. It's cold and the misty fog sweeps through. Time for a quick photo at the busy signpost.     Considering the number of tourists this mountain attracts I think the French could do something about the sign for the top which is just a little post with a garbage can next to it.  Why not put something up there which is an attractive place to take the essential photo to prove' I've done it!   Still, it's too cold and wet to stay for long so, over the top and down the other side. A long and winding road, indeed. Once again, hours up then minutes down. We make it to Forcalquier through some undulating countryside which has the delight of a purple carpet of lavendar covering the brown earth.   So this is what Provence is famous for! We don't spot any sunflowers but the intensity of colours is really true. It is in the air but also must have to do with the sharp contrasts between yellow wheat, purple flowers, blue sky and white clouds. It's a pleasure for all the senses. The smell of lavendar travels with us for kilometre after kilometre. People in cars would never know that just outside their air conditioned bubble the air is full of an intense and unforgettable perfume.   Another pretty village with the town square the centre of activities in the evening.  Teenagers zoom around on their mopeds trying to impress the girls while the elders sit quietly under umbrellas sipping wine or coffee. The charm of another French village. Do they just do this sort of thing for us tourists?   "
120,"   Today was to be a shortish day through the plains of Provence - or so we thought. My definition of plains includes the word 'flat' but there doesn't appear to be much in the way of flat land in this part of France so we were confronted with a meandering road that seemed to go uphill far more than it went downhill.  Still, the fields of lavendar and wheat meant that the journey was a visual delight.        Traffic on the roads was also fairly light. I must have been suffering from heatstroke because at a small cafe stop I purchased a kilo of lavendar honey - pretty stupid considering I now had to carry it on my bike and then later I realised I wouldn't be able to take it back to Australia anyway because of quarantine restrictions. Oh well, Cherie would enjoy it in London. Moustiers was described as a forgettable, tourist village in our guide but we found it to be absolutely fabulous. Its claim to some fame is the suspended star above the village - put there by a man with nothing much else to think of while imprisoned by some enemy forces a long time ago.   It commands a dramatic position on the side of a cliff with a stream cascading down through the centre.     The shops and cafes and village houses nestled comfortably into rugged landscape.   We had a pleasant meal on a warm evening, filled our water bottles from the icy cold water and enjoyed strolling around the higgledy piggledy streets.     Market Day at Moustiers happened to be the next day and the streets were crammed with local produce: cheeses by the hundreds, bread, fish, vegetables, wines, fruits, crafts. We strolled through the market selecting our usual luncheon faire of cheese, fruit and baguette. The local textiles prints reflect the Provence region and the designs and colours of some of the items were stunning. I had to get a huge tablecloth for Carol of course to add more weight to the bike. Another great place.    Moustiers was a rest day and after the markets we pedalled out to Lake St Croixto enjoy a swim and a lunch by the waters.  The water was surprisingly pleasant and not as cold as I expected so we just had a relatively quiet day watching the French at leisure enjoying their water sports.   "
121," Our closest brush with disaster on the whole trip happened in one of the tunnels which line this road. It was a winding tunnel that was long enough to be nearly as dark as night in the middle. Cherie led with her light on and the road seemed clear but just as we reached the middle a motorbike with a pillion passenger came roaring through from the opposte direction, cutting the corner and narrowly missing Cherie - despite her being well over on the correct side of the road. I think the motorbike rider got as big a shock as we did. No harm done so we just cycled on our way going up and down more hills for the rest of the day. However, the incident was a reminder of the small margin between disaster and success.     The day wore on and once again, we discovered there is no flat countryside in this part of France! The villages started to become less quaint and less rustic as we started to get nearer to the Mediterranean. Modern towns and a large Army Base changed the feel of the ride and it started to become a chore. The roads became busier and we became lost once again trying to find our way out of an Army town Draguignan. In my enthusiasm to save weight I had inadverdantly cut off the portion of the map we so desperately needed right now. We thought we were headed in the right direction but the road soon became upgraded into an expressway.  Even if I had not known that bikes were not allowed on that type of road, I would have retreated because the cars were too fast and furious. Eventually we made our way out of a madhouse of a town, through the army base and down a picturesque gorge to find Le Muy, a largish town with fast cars and too many people. Still, the caravan park was pleasant enough even though there was a party in the amenities block that had a huge boom box blasting until early the next morning. The entertainment at Le Muy seemed to be part of the offerings but the noise would have kept the whole park awake. I have learnt long ago that ear plugs are valuable little things and managed to sleep through most of the party.  French caravan (camping) parks are interesting venues and could do with a chapter on their own trying to explain them to foreigners.  They have their own culture and rules that everyone except us blow-ins seemed to understand. They are like mini holiday camps with entertainment provided, wine bars and cafe style food areas. The variety of toilet blocks is interesting and ranged from fully uni sex to partly mixed to strict separation to uni sex showers and public men's urinals. It was rather disconcerting to be standing at a urinal in full view of the passing crowds but, I reasoned, the Frenchmen seemed relaxed about it so just stay cool and be like the locals. Because there seemed to be no universal rule about the toilet block in each new camping park we came to I had to carefully observe what was happening before venturing inside.   Having survived the party and the toilet block ,it was a relief to be leaving Le Muy early the next day for our last short bike trip down to the coast.
"
122," We had already pre-booked a flight for the next day but I felt no inclination to stay in a place swarming with so many people. So, I forfeited the next day's tickets and got on the first available flight. This caused the first negative reaction from Cherie on the whole trip as she had been planning to stay one more day and didn't think I would get tickets so easily. She had arranged to house sit in London starting the next night so hadn't any place to stay that night in London. I told her she could stay at our hotel in London but she wasn't too impressed with that - after all she'd lived in London for two years and here she was being asked to leave Nice without even seeing it! Oh well we got over it, packed our bags and flew back to London that day. The trip was over...until next time.

"
124,"  My daughter had a TREK 5000 which is the same bike without the shockies.  She had no troubles.  Make sure you have a granny gear I used pedals with straps not clips.  This meant I only needed one pair of comfortable walking shoes.  A handlebar bag with a map holder would be helpful.  I strapped camera bike onto my aero bars and shoved the day's map under the strap. A custom bag and waterproof map holder would be better.  Camera - have it readily accessible and take plenty of pictures. A digital camera is small, light and convenient tho' limited in it's ability to vary shots. I had a 35mm camera but next time digital is the way to go.  Mirror - essential. Mine was attached to the end of the drop bar. I used it constantly and felt safer knowing what was coming up behind me.( Make sure it goes on the left side for France) Lights - essential. Flashing laser lights front and rear are great. Tunnels can be long and dark so a headlight is also a good idea.  Helmet - You don't have to wear one in France - the locals tend not to - even when riding mopeds and scooters(I have no idea what their brain injury hospitals are like but I imagine they're pretty full). However, having had a fair share of bruising crashes I know the first thing I think of when tumbling down is ""Thank goodness I've got a helmet"". Wear one because you never know.  Gloves - they begin to stink and need to be kept outside the tent at all times but they do help absorb the vibrations and also protect the palm of your hand in a fall.  Gearing - Don't get hung up on it. Talk to your bikeshop about what's best. You might need to think about what terrain you'll be riding through to help determine the gears.  Tyres - This is another controversial topic. I used the standard Bontrager 38mm tyres that came on the bike. They're heavy but they're very stable and I felt quite happy in riding along rough roads and shoulders. No punctures and no anxieties about stones, gravel or rough surfaces. Spares and Tools - A pump, repair kit, spare tube, set of allen keys, some spokes taped to the downframe, spare gear cable, a few spare chain links, chain remover. That should do. Make sure you know how to change and repair a tube.
"
125,"Language - it helps to know a little French but gestures and hand signals can be used. I learnt that the French never assumed I spoke English because I realised they have so many foreigners who look the same but speak a variety of languages.  If in doubt, speak English to let them know - they may or may not also know English but won't assume you do unless you speak first. Maps - The Michelin series served me well and had I brought all of the map I had cut up we probably would have just sailed on with no dramas about getting lost. One important and never to be forgotten triviality about the maps: pay careful attention to the little 'v' shapes on the roads.  They indicate the direction and steepness of slopes. One 'v' is okay. Two 'v' symbols together and it's a 10% slope and you start to struggle. Three 'v' symbols together and it's a real pain. If possible choose routes that minimise the 'v' symbol or at least make sure they all point downhill! Roads and Motorists - the roads are narrow and the French drive fast. Gendarmes are few and far between. While motorists are not surprised by cyclists, their speed and fatalism can lead to close calls. The bikers and scooter riders are the ones that seem the craziest."

131,"     Sat, the 17th     Think I'll go ahead and wrap this up, the next day while I rode to Trees of Mystery near Klamath Cal. thought things over and decided I was going to cut my trip short by a day, so when I ran into the family at Trees of Mystery I threw the bike in the truck and returned to real life again! It was a about a fourty mile day. South of Cresent City Cal. there was a challenging hill. I rode it on a weekend, thank goodness, very few trucks. But with very limited shoulder felt like I was getting rubbed by campers often enough!  The downhill on the other side is long,fast and WHAT A RUSH!!! sometimes I don't use good sense on how fast I go. riding thru the Redwoods is fantastic, but to much distractions on my mind. I didn't get pictures thru this stretch, oh well next time. I enjoyed this trip more than I would have thought I could. Some things I will do different next time is lower my gearing, take less stuff. I think two changes of clothes would be plenty, washing them in the shower works fairly well. and besides when your by yourself how bad can you smell! I will end up buying a real backpacking tent, that weighs less, The thermorest pad seems to work much better after some use. The small lightweight sleeping blanket type thing I used was rated down to fourty five degrees and works well at that temp. Loved my light wool sweater for evenings and cool mornings and in the fog. Will remember fork and spoon and can opener! Maybe I'll know more about the camera! So untill next time,  Dave   "
132,"Hopefully this will be helpful, or at least amusing, to other riders.  Looking back on the ride a year later (and after just finishing a 3 week tour from Georgia to Virginia), the best advice that I would give anyone thinking about riding cross-country is to just jump in and do it.
"
133,"The first thing you need to know is that we have to type with my thumbs, so there will be plenty of typos. After staying last night in Richmond with my Uncle Bob and Aunt Bunny, Bob shuttled us over to Yorktown, where we began. (Thanks, Bob.) Bob served as our official SAG wagon & photographer today; the trip's not official unless you get a photo with your rear wheels in the York River. Today's ride was steeped in history. We began our ride beneath the shadow of the Victory Monument, which (Bob tells me) commemorates British General Cornwallis' surrender in 1781 to the first recorded Big Mac Attack. From there, we rode along the Colonial Parkway to Williamsburg, the original Renaissance faire.  You can't leave without having your head photographed in the stockade. Enough history for us; time for some ENGLISH! We took a nap on the lawn of the College of William & Mary, in front of Tucker Hall, home of the English department. We dosed up on Kulchur, of course. Kris sniffed around in Tucker Hall, then we said goodbye to Historic Williamsburg & rode toward Historic Jamestown. A lovely, flat ride 9 miles or so along the James River. As we pulled into the campsite we saw a man looking much like us: sunburned, sweaty, pulling a BOB trailer behind a Cannondale and looking for a place to camp. His name was Andreas, he'd just flown in from Germany and ridden 60 miles from Norfolk and he was going along our same route, at least to Missoula. ""I'm not in the shape I used to be,"" he told us. At the Historic Jamestown Beach Campsite, for a mere $20/person we could stay with the volleyball tournament crowd.  We all decided to keep going, and 9 miles later we found the Chickahominy River campground, quiet, on a sandy stretch of the river, where all 3 of us shared a campsite for $20. We tore into Paige's killer Congo bars, then swam, and settled in for the night. Thanks for listening... we'll check back in from Charlottesville, home of the fried doughnut sandwich. kris and kes
"
134,"First, some political commentary from Kris... May 2: We turned in last night to the sounds of George Bush addressing the world from the aircraft carrier ""Abraham Lincoln."" Ten miles into today's ride along rte. 5 (""The John Tyler Memorial Highway""), we passed Tyler's Plantation, ""Sherwood Forest.""   [Stinging political commentary censored here]. We look forward to the day when Bush, like Tyler, is long forgotten except by tourists who happen upon the ""Rambo Ranch"" in Midland, TX. We started our ride at the Chickahominy River near its confluence with the James and wandered toward Richmond among old plantations along the James and Civil War battlefields (there were two major campaigns here - one in 1862 and the other in 1864, which ended with the retreating Confederates' burning Richmond.) Once we reached Mechanicsville, we had had enough and caught a ride back to Richmond with Bob.  We took the next day off to look around Richmond and celebrate cousin Laurel's 16th birthday. At her party, we were shocked to find that we had to hang out with the grown-ups. I guess we just aren't cool anymore. The next day, Sunday, we took off from Bob & Bunny's place and continued our trek. Bob joined us on his un-laden racing bike for the 50 miles to the town of Mineral. On the way, we enjoyed almost traffic-free roads once we broke free of Richmond's sprawl. High points included the town of Bumpass, Lake Anna, and finding free camping (and ice) at the Vol. Fire Department in Mineral--where, we discovered, Andreas had camped the previous night.   In Mineral we also discovered something that the world has been waiting for for decades - caffeinated malt liquor. That will have to wait for breakfast. After saying goodbye to bob and bunny, we settled in to enjoy our spacious accommodations.  The next day we set out in the rain for the long ride to Charlottesville. The rain let up gradually as we cycled along roads that don't even rate a centerline. In Palmyra, we paused by the Rivanna River for quick lunch. As we sat there, there was a loud explosion and the ground shook - though alarmed, we wrote it off as being a nearby quarry that was blasting. A few miles down the road, a woman told us that it was an earthquake. Later we found out that it was the largest quake in Virginia for 20 years and that we had been sitting less than 10 miles from the epicenter. The rest of the day was great until we got to Monticello, where we were summarily expelled for (gasp) trying to ride our bikes up to Mr. Jefferson's house. You would think they would a bit accommodating since it is on a national bike route that celebrates the nation's history. I (kes) told them that I'm related to Sally Hemmings, but that didn't seem to help. We rode on to stay with sister Ann in Charlottesville. We had a great dinner and spent the evening resupplying n catching up with Kes' cat Lola, who is staying here for her summer. This afternoon, we will tackle the long climb up to the Blue Ridge Parkway and the head southwest into the mountains. Finally, correction. Charlottesville is not the home of the fried doughnut sandwich; it's the home of the deep-fried bacon cheese dog, apparently invented by Edgar Allan Poe in his days here. Kes Roberts and Kris Boudreau from.the.road
"
135,"Earlier today we paused on the banks of the New River in Radford, VA (actually at a Sonic Burger, but the river was almost in sight.  The New is the oldest river in the US, which explains the name. The ride after Radford was a roller coaster through the Draper valley, which included a history lesson at the general store in the town of Draper. Yesterday, we had our hardest day of riding so.  Surprisingly, the rolling terrain between Troutville and Christiansburg was harder on us than to climb up to and along the Blue Ridge Parkway.  We finished by loitering in the town square of C'burg, which was the site of the first duel with rifles known to have taken place in the state of Virginia. ""It resulted in the death of both men,"" says the historical marker.  The people of Christiansburg must be very proud. We stayed last night with our friend Sara Belcher in Blacksburg.  Sara very kindly took us in despite its being the eve of her graduation from VA Tech's landscape architecture program and having house full of family.  It was great to see the various Belchers for the first time in years and Kes' sister Ann came down for the night to resupply us with fresh Gatorade and relieve us of our supply of hair care products.  Now, to jump back a few days... Our last e-mail left us at Charlottesville.   Thunderstorms had been predicted and we wanted not to lose more time, but the roads out of C'ville were hilly and gravely, and our progress was slow.  Our departure from C'ville was delayed substantially by a leisurely breakfast on the downtown mall (why can't Athens do his?) After we finally left, we enjoyed the ascent into the mountains.  The only downside was shopkeepers' repeated refusal to let use their bathrooms.  Apparently indoor plumbing is a scarce resource there not to be shared, even with paying customers.  This trend ended quickly, though, near the top of Afton mountain where we met the fabled 'cookie lady.'  In Afton (in its heyday the second largest shipping point for apples in the US) there are now a handful of houses clinging to the mountainside.  One of these is occupied by June Curry, known to transam riders and AT hikers as the cookie lady.  Since 1976 she's been offering water, food, and lodging to pedalers.  She has turned her old house into a free hostel for anyone who makes the trip up rte 795 to the Blue Ridge Parkway, which lies just beyond.  As a result, the house has become a museum of the Transamerica trail.  There are latterly 1000s of postcards and 100s of newspaper articles from cyclists who have passed through since 1976.  Any doubts we had about our trip disappeared as we read about others' experiences.  We said goodbye to Ms. Curry on Wednesday morning and headed up to mile zero of the Blue Ridge parkway at rockfish gap.  We thought this would be our hardest day, but it went by quickly.  After traveling about 30 miles on the parkway, we quickly descended rte 56 to the town of Vesuvius.  The switchbacks there were hard to descend - can't imagine going up them.  That's why it was part of the Tour Dupont, I suppose.  From Vesuvius, it was a casual ride alongside their South River most of the way to Lexington, where we ended for the day. Before leaving Lexington, we made a quick tour of downtown and Washington & Lee Univ.  Highlights were visiting Robert E. Lee's tomb (now part of a nice museum) and getting yelled at for running a nonexistent red light.  The latter was either an example of colorblindness or karma.  We heard that the cops were still looking for a kid who showed up with a bag of fireworks from cherry grove, SC in 1985.
"
136,"Shortly after leaving Lexington, we came to Natural Bridge.  Since neither of had ever visited this natural wonder, we rode down the long hill to town and shelled out our $10.  It truly was amazing.  So was the ice cream for sale at the snack bar.  We needed to get back on the road, so  We skipped the Mini-Golf and the Haunted Monster Museum.  It was hard to pass these up, though, since Jefferson described both in his Notes on the State of Virginia as being ""totally kick-ass."" It was another day of hard riding and hot sun, and as our route followed I-81 fairly closely, we also had lots of noise and exhaust.  So we were happy to encounter the town of Buchanan (est. 1811), with its old wood-frame shops.  We stopped at ""The Fountain,"" a pharmacy-soda counter built in 1949, later closed then bought & restored & reopened as a Christian pharmacy (its slogan: ""where faith and shakes flow."") It's on both the Appalachian Trail and the Transamerica route, and the owners keep a notebook for travelers to sign.  We stayed that night at the Troutville city park, a small but highly used park.  It was full of kids & families when we arrived.  Adults walked around a track.  The last walkers left around 9:30 and the first ones arrived at 7 the next morning.  This place was a great place to end a great day, much of it spent following rivers: Buffalo Creek, Broad Creek, and The James River. Next day (May 9) we rode through the Roanoke Valley, which we'd looked down on last summer when we rode the Blue Ridge Parkway.  Today Kes walked his bike for the first time (Kris did so yesterday)"" up a staggeringly steep hill into Christiansburg.      May 10.  It's been a long day and we've already written too much, so we'll just tell you that we're staying tonight in Wytheville, VA, which you may have driven past on either I-81 or I-77.  Kes was worried about our safety, as W'ville is a larger place than Troutville, but the park is across the street from the sheriff's department and the park was full of 8th graders at a party.  So instead of being harassed by crack heads we were accosted by adolescent boys asking us what we ate, how we showered, and whether we didn't get tired.  It's now 11:00, the party has turned into a dance party, except for the geeks who occupy themselves popping balloons, and the kids left us alone.  And so, to sleep.  More later.

"
137,"After 12 days of riding, we finally finished Virginia.  Before you give us hell for taking so long, consider that Va. is the longest of the 11 states we'll pass through (nearly 600 miles) and has the most climbing - about 31,000 feet. (Colorado has 16,000).  May 11 - Mother's Day -- The 60 miles from Wytheville to Damascus again tested our endurance.  Just as we started out for the day, the rain began.  Fortunately it ended within about an hour and blue skies began appearing.  The downside was that the wind that was pushing the storm over us was coming right at us.  Even downhills became difficult in the headwind.  We stopped for a late breakfast in Rural Retreat, 11 miles along our route, where we saw one of the kids from last night's party.  ""Y'all haven't gotten very far,"" he said.  Thanks kid.  We pressed on into the wind and eventually reached the Mt. Rogers area.  Mt. Rogers is the highest point in Va. and the AT goes through here.  In the town of Konnarock we left the road and jumped on the Virginia Creeper rail trail for the last 12 miles or so into town.  The was a great way to end the day - cruising through the woods and over Laurel Creek on the thin strip of packed gravel - all downhill - over old RR trestles & past blooming mountain laurel.  The trail runs straight, unlike the road, so we passed over the creek about 15 times in 10 miles.   The trail took us straight to 'The Place' in Damascus, a hostel for cyclists and AT hikers run by the Methodist church here.  It's overrun by northbound AT through-hikers who only refer to each other by their trail names and entertain themselves by tossing a stick back and forth.  Inspired by this heady culture, we have given each other road names: Peachy for Kris and T-Hiney for Kes.  Damascus is a good place to relax for a day --it's got a bike shop, some outfitters, a bar and 2 restaurants, as well as a dollar store.  But it's also overrun with hikers, those posing as hikers and those trying to sponge off hikers, as well as locals mostly hostile to hikers, like the man whose property is adjacent to the hostel where we pitched our tent: either meanness or stupidity prompted him to shoot a skunk that wandered into his yard in the middle of the night! It was good to get out of Damascus.  The next day the scenery quickly changed as we began traveling into the Cumberland Mtns, which even to our uneducated eyes look much different from the older mountains of the Blue Ridge.  The hills here are much steeper and sandstone and limestone outcroppings line the roads.  After 51 miles we stopped for the night in the huge William P. Harris city park in the tiny town of Council.  While riding into the park, Kris --err, Peachy-- was jeered by a kid who was tickled by her trailer:  ""Hah, Hah, Look at that!""  But there was no train running alongside the park, no teenage party, and no dead skunk to keep us awake.  It was a quiet night. Today's ride was a short 26 miles to Breaks Interstate Park, which straddles the VA/KY border.  The weather report on the radio this morning was ""It might rain today and that's a cotton-pickin' shame.""  Well it didn't rain, and we seem to have escaped the high winds at last, but the climbs toward the end of the day made us glad to have found Breaks State Park, known here as ""The Grand Canyon of the South."" (Apparently ever state in the South has one of these).  Along the way we encountered many trucks transporting coal and hardwood lumber.     Tomorrow we hit Kentucky, dreaded by cyclists for its many stray dogs.  We think we're prepared, though we haven't bought 6 cans of pepper spray, like the apprehensive British bike tourist whom Kes read about on the internet.  So long from the western end of Virginia! Peachy & T-Hiney
"
138,"Eastern Kentucky is beautiful and the people are nice, though it looks like whatever wealth is created by the mining here doesn't stick around for long.  The roads are lined with many ramshackle trailers, hen houses and broken-down cars. The roads are in terrible condition, and made more perilous to cyclists by the rumble strips that line even the smallest roads. Our advice to anyone considering the TransAm is to just skip the eastern 100 miles of KY. With the rain, some of the environmental problems from mining were obvious as every stream we passed ran thick with silt.  No fish here...
"
139,"May 16, we left Pippa Passes several hours after Don and Dave (who rise at 5 and typically leave by 6). We stopped for a late lunch in Buckhorn, where there's a store and P.O.  While Kes made a phone call, I asked the storeowner if there was more to Buckhorn than what I saw.  ""You're lookin' at it,"" he replied --noting that he works in the federal building, since it's got a PO, and telling me about the time a Yellow Pages representative called him to announce that he'd been selected from all the merchants in Buckhorn to receive a discount on a Yellow Pages ad.  ""Lady, where are you calling from?"" he asked her.  When she said ""Albuquerque,"" he said, ""you've never seen Buckhorn, KY, have you?  I'm the only merchant here!""  We landed this night at the Booneville Methodist Church, where Don and Dave had pulled in an hour earlier. May 17.  We woke up to pouring rain --even Don and Dave didn't leave here till after 12.  But we had a radio, a shelter, and coffee, so we waited out the storm and left in the afternoon.  Along the way we encountered Don and Dave, who, having broken another spoke, planned to hitch to a bike shop. . .  Finally we were officially out of the hills and cruised up the Red Lick Creek valley, in the rain.  When we showed up unannounced at Still House Hollow Farm, a sometimes B&B run by Hiram and Jamie Snowden, the readily took us in and their only charge for our room and board was a willingness to talk about our trip and listen to their travel tales (a deal that you don't get unless you show up on a bike). May 18 --The next day brought us to Berea after 17 miles of rainy riding.  Berea College still holds to its original mission of educating kids of from the southern mountains.  After a quick visit with Kris's friend Stephanie Browner, who teaches here, we caught a ride to Lexington where we visited with Kes' cousins, the Daniels. It was especially nice to see cousin Stuart's three little girls. May 19 -- Today, we rode from Lexington to Springfield, passing through horse farms before descending down into the Kentucky River Gorge.  We paused at the recreated Shaker Village of Pleasant Hill just long enough to have a huge lunch and get ""Simple Gifts"" stuck in our heads. May 20 - Election Day in KY - No liquor sales while the polls are open.  After Springfield, we were dodging thunderstorms, so we had trouble processing things.  Here is what we learned: A few miles west of S'field, Davie Crocket taught Abe Lincoln how to play golf.  This is commemorated by the Lincoln Homestead State Park Golf Course (""I Scored Better at Lincoln Homestead State Park,"" says the bumper sticker.)  Apparently this is true, since ""Right in thar by the fireplace in that thar cabin is where Mr. Lincoln a'courted Mrs. Lincoln [Abe's parents],"" the volunteer gift shop cashier told us immediately before double charging us for our post cards and Lincoln shot glass.  Nearby in Bardstown, My Old Kentucky Home State Park commemorates Stephen Foster's penning of Deutschland Uber Alles (or something - hard to tell from the road), apparently while playing golf since there's another state subsidized golf course here.  Still further down the road, Thomas Merton and Ezra Brooks invented bourbon, we think. At any rate, the Heaven Hill and Makers Mark distilleries made it into our itinerary, as did the Gethesemani Abbey, the oldest Trappist monastery in the U.S.  At Maker's Mark, I (kes) as a MM Ambassador was given a proclamation (""Oh exalted one,"" it began) and got a medal after dipping my own bottle in the red wax.  I was truly honored to be so well targeted by the company's marketing.  In Howardstown, we found a new cheap beer - Sterling, and a new cheap brand of peach soda - Mr. Fizz. Tonight, we arrived in Hodgenville, the actual birthplace of Lincoln and were greeted by Bill Wilson, the pastor of a local church (and former Athens resident) who is letting us stay in the church's youth center.  He showed us around, saying, ""This is Hodgenville's version of the 40 Watt club."" When he bid us good night, he included Athens in the prayer he said for us. We're now about 900 miles in.... 3300 to go. Kes Roberts and Kris Boudreau from.the.road
"
140,"A quick rundown of what we've been up to... May 22 -  Hodgenville, KY to Rough River  State Park - 55 mi. We started with a visit to the Abe Lincoln Museum (where the Gift shop offers slivers of brick from Lincoln's home alongside Confederate flag shot glasses) We found good pie at the Sonora stop, as Cousin Frankie promised and somewhere in Hardin county we restocked our honey supply with a pint of dark sourwood from the roadside in White Mills. May 23 - Rough River to Sebree - 74 mi. Another flat section - great riding through miles of farmland, but not much to report.  In Sebree, we stayed in the basement of the  First Baptist Church after the pastor saw us lost on the way to the (closed) city park.  We continue to be amazed at how generous and trusting folks are.  May 24 - Sebree to Marion - 45 mi. Still more great, but uneventful, riding as we head toward the edge of KY.  In Dixon, we stopped and talked with some locals for a while and found out where all the 76 bike route signs had gone - they were snatched up as souvenirs years ago. In Marion, we met up with Donna and Mike Wasson, whom we had met through a cycling listserv.  They very generously put us up, fed us, restocked our Nutella supple, and shuttled us between their home in Murray and Marion.  Donna was a member of the very first group to ride the TransAm back in 1976 when she was a bike messenger in DC - it was great to hear about her experience and compare it to ours.  It was fun looking through her ride memorabilia. She and Mike still ride and it looks like W. Ky. is a great place for cycling.  Thanks Donna and Mike!  May 25 - Ed Roberts B'Day - Int'l Croquet Day - Marion, KY to Galconda, IL - 38 mi. On our way to the Ohio River ferry, we met up with John and Mark, two English guys doing the route.  We crossed the river together and quickly discovered that Ill. ain't flat.  We all camped on a bluff overlooking the Ohio. May 26 - Memorial Day - Galconda to Carbondale - 73 mi. The four of us (""The Coalition"") set out over more hilly terrain and soon met up with Dave and Don (the Mass. guys).  We ended our day in Carbondale, where Memorial Day started in 1868 (found that out over the best biscuits and gravy so far at Mary Lou's).  May 27 - Carbondale to Chester - 48 mi  Before setting out, Kris did the unthinkable by putting a Shimano mtn. bike crank set (complete with plastic chain guard) on her otherwise all Campy bike.  This should give her the lower gears that she's needed for the past 1100 miles. From there, we rode with John through the Mississippi R. flood plain and along levees to Chester, the home of Popeye.  In Chester, the cops let us all camp in the city park's playground. A woman there told us that ""we have a big prison here and a mental hospital too.""  We took this as a threat and behaved.  Besides the bronze Popeye statue, the biggest discovery here was Stag beer. May 28 - Chester to Farmington, MO - 48 miles.  MO is nice, but this was a horribly windy day.  The Brits and the Yankees are now way ahead of us.  We were immediately attracted to the Farmington skate park, swarming with kids, where we met Missouri's oldest skateboarder.  Later, as we tried to decide whether to camp behind the prison or at the baseball field, we met we met Craig and Leslie McIntosh, who put us up.  Craig said that their summer hobby is putting up cyclists and we are their 1st this year. And this just in: May 29 - Farmington to Centerville - the Ozarks roll, but steeply - hardwood forests everywhere - clear spring fed rivers. k,k
"
141,"May 30 Centerville, MO to Alley Spring, 48 miles -- We camped out in the rain in front of the county courthouse in Centerville, where we were guarded by the town dog, which crept under our fly and periodically shook itself off. We awoke felling and smelling like wet dogs, but couldn't do anything about it. Our cleanliness quotient rose when we reached the Current River at Owl Bend and promptly jumped in.  We also dove into the Jacks Fork River Near Alley Spring when we ended our day just west of Eminence.  And followed up with showers (cold) at Alley Spring campground.  Unlike the rivers of the other states we've gone through, it is actually possible to come out of south MO's rivers cleaner than you go in.  They're mostly spring fed and run clear.  By contrast, we were almost afraid to touch the Mississippi R. when we came upon it in Ill.  May 31 - Alley Spring to Houston, 36 mi. -- Hot showers with soap and everything.  The food in Houston sucks, though.  We had the worst meal of the trip at ""The Tiger's Den,"" a restaurant that the owner told us he opened because he wanted the town to have a ""theme"" restaurant, the theme being the local high school's mascot (it's amazing what a few plastic trophies and an old letter jacket can do to brighten things up.)  His motivation, unfortunately, had nothing to do with food. After this and other similar experiences, we now know why you never hear about Missouri cuisine. June 1 - Houston to Marshfield, 65 mi The Webster Co. Fairground rodeo arena offered a great lukewarm shower.    June 2 - Marshfield to Ash Grove - 48 mi. We lucked out by running into the city park manager who let us into the brand new bath house at the city pool.  A good scrubbing.   June 3 - Ash Grove, MO to Pittsburg, KS - 71 mi.-- Missouri continued to throw hills at us even during this last day here.  The Ozarks just don't give up.  During a 3 hour lunch stop in Golden City, Cooky's Cafe single handedly redeemed the reputation of Missouri cooking for us.  We camped in the nice city park in Pittsburg, which has a golf course and amusement park, but no showers... June 4 - Pittsburg to Toronto Lake - 103 mi. A long day of riding followed by marginal cleaning up... the state park showers were cold and shut off every 30 seconds. June 5 - Pittsburg to Cassoday (Prairie Chicken Capitol of the World, 59 mi. This should be the cleanest day yet, since we are now waiting in downtown Cassoday waiting for Kes' friend Rob Williamson to pick us up and deliver us to Manhattan, KS for a much needed day off, with all the comforts of home.  Next week: by popular demand, the Crohn's disease toilet report. We're writing you from Kansas, which our book recommends as the ""friendliest state"" (where ""almost all the drivers wave"").  On our first day in KS we were run off the road by a trucker and yelled at (""go home!"") by another driver.  On the other hand, we haven't seen a Confederate flag in days. In KS you can also have a conversation while riding because you're not huffing and puffing up hills or being drowned out by automobile traffic.  During these first days here, we have also benefited from tailwinds most of the time.  Yesterday we had 2 options: 65 miles to Chanute, or 103 miles to Toronto.  The flat terrain enabled us to choose the longer day.  In Chanute, we could have stayed for free with ""yodeling Katy Lopeman.""  Katy plays the ukulele and sings.  she only asks that her guests let her yodel a greeting, bedtime and farewell song, and that they refrain from cussing.  We could have agreed to either condition but not both, so we rode through Chanute without meeting this  legend of the trail.  Kes Roberts and Kris Boudreau
"
142,"June 7 - Cassoday, KS to Newton - 39 mi. Within minutes of Rob's dropping us off, we were in the middles of huge storm fighting a headwind.  In Newton, we settled in at the city park.  The next morning, we met some Mennonites when we discovered that we had pitched our tent where they planned to have their service that morning.  We quickly packed up and left to avoid being conscripted into the pageant they were planning. June 8 - Newton to Sterling - 60 mi.  More headwinds. Beginning in Buhler, KS and through Eastern CO, every single town is centered around huge grain elevators and the landscape is dominated by wheat fields. Grain and cattle trucks and farm machinery are the main traffic on the roads here and the drivers give us plenty of room. June 9 - Sterling to Larned - 53 mi. More headwinds. In Larned, we crossed paths with the Bike Across Kansas week-long ride.  After sharing the Pizza Hut with these folks, we offer the following advice to all of our bike geek colleagues out there: Unless you really are afraid of someone breaking in front of you in the salad bar line, take the little bike mirror off of your glasses during dinner.  It looks silly and you'll end up with food on it. June 10 - Larned to Scott City - 123 mi. Never squander a good tailwind. June 11 - Scott City to Tribune - 47 mi. We have begun running into eastbound cyclists almost every day now.  All sorts of folks are out riding.  On the way to Scott City yesterday we met Duncan, who is riding from San Fran. to DC so that he can ""flip off the President."" (We have a similar plan - we're riding to Oregon so we can flip off Rhett Lawrence.) And today we met Scott, who told us that ""tandem is the way to go."" He offered us this fantastic advice while standing astride his expensive, brand-new single bike that he had to buy after his wife/tandem partner abandoned him in Colorado because she was 'homesick.'  Sure.  Scott also helped us out by telling us ""Gee, you got a late start and you have a headwind."" When we arrived in Tribune we went immediately to the Horace Greeley museum to find out why the county and town had been named in honor of the 19th century editor of the New York Tribune. We still don't know, but did get a good look at Cy Youngblood's celebrated marble and waffle iron collections. The docent who insisted on a full-fledged tour squandered our anticipated time at the city pool; by the time she released us with a lot of useless information and no insight into local history, a storm had moved in and the pool had shut.  So, no swim and no shower.  June 12 - Tribune, KS to Haswell, CO.  We continued cruising west on Hwy 96 and reached CO this morning.  We finally began to see some hills here, a welcome change after 500 miles of sitting through flat terrain & suffering saddle sores.  Unlike KS, though, many of the towns here are dead. Locals tell us that he railroad shut down several years ago and most of the farmers sold their water rights to feed Denver's sprawl 20 years ago.  As a result, towns like Haswell are mostly abandoned and look like the set for the next Texas Chainsaw Massacre. June 13 - Haswell to Ordway - 40 mi We surfed in on a tailwind in time to miss another rain storm, which we're sitting out in the bike hostel of the Ordway Hotel.
"
143,"The Wyoming winds are infuriating.  Here's how we got here: June 14 - Ordway, CO to Pueblo - 50 mi. Nice easy riding as we put in our final day on the flats. Early in the ride, we caught our first glimpse of the Rockies - this was especially exciting since it had been well over a week since we had seen anything on the horizon. June 15 - 17.  0 miles. We took it easy for 3 days in Boulder at the Will Roberts B&B/bike repair shop. Despite being busy finishing his thesis, Will put us up, got our bikes bike in top shape, and, of course, helped us find the best beer and burritos in town. We were also fortunate to see Kris's brother Gordy  a/k/a Scratch the Beggar, who was nearby with the Colorado Renaissance Festival. June 18 - Canon City to Schechter Hostel - 33 mi. When Will shuttled us back to the route, we cheated and had him drop us off a day's ride outside of Pueblo. We had seen enough of the flatlands and were ready for the mountains.  It quickly became obvious that we were in the Rockies indeed. We started riding among the blooming cacti of the Colorado desert and finished much higher among Aspens and Lodge Pole Pines near the town of Guffy. Toward the end of the day it started raining and we were quickly cold and miserable. At the hostel, we shared the bunkhouse with Tom Parks, a retired lawyer who now helps run a hostel in San Luis Obispo, CA.  This is Tom's second trip on the Transam and we enjoyed talking to him about his experiences.  June 19 - Schechter Hostel to Fairplay - 42 mi.  We started off with a casual climb up to Currant Creek Pass (9,404 ft.) and a descent to Hartsel, where we had lunch at Dorothy's Tamale Wagon.  After that, though, the weather got ugly (we started to see the pattern at this point) and we struggled the rest of the way to Fairplay. The high valley beyond the front range is called the South Park and Fairplay is (we think) where Kris's favorite show South Park takes place.  Except for the nasty weather, this was great riding through rolling open terrain with huge peaks in every direction. June 20 - Fairplay to Kremmling - 79 mi. We started out with a 12 mile climb to the Continental Divide at Hoosier Pass (11,541 ft), the highest point on the entire coast-to-coast route.  Though the thin air made the ride difficult, it was actually no more difficult than the climbs in the mountains back east. Tom had also stayed in Fairplay and we rode most of the way up with him.  From the pass, we had 67 miles of mostly downhill through Breckenridge and Frisco on the way to Kremmling. It wasn't easy though, since we had to deal with rain (and snow in Breckenridge), wind and horrible traffic. June 21 - Kremmling to Walden - 63 mi.  A perfect day of riding.  We started with an easy climb up to Muddy Pass (8,772 ft) where we crossed the Continental Divide again.  The rest of the day was a casual ride through the sagebrush, with prairie dogs keeping us company, across the North Park between the Sierra Madre mountains to our west and the Medicine Bow Mountains to our east. We could also make out the peaks of Rocky Mtn. National Park in the distance. In Walden (Moose Viewing Capital of Colorado), we shared the city park with three guys from Portland who were heading east.  Cont.....
"
144,"More riding: June 22 - Walden to Riverside, WY - 50 mi. More great riding through the range, mostly with a tailwind, as we entered WY, our 7th state.  Except for a couple of long climbs over ridges, the riding was casual until a huge storm blew in from the west just shy of Riverside.  After being blown off the road several times, we ducked into a ditch. When we arrived in Riverside we were disappointed, then relieved, to have missed the Woodchoppers Jamboree & Rodeo by a day.  From the look of some of the folks in the Mangy Moose Saloon, there was a lot more than wood chopping going on.  We camped beside the Encampment River.   June 23 - Riverside to Rawlins - 63 mi. Another great day of riding ended with lousy weather. We started by cruising to Saratoga, where we enjoyed the hot sulfur springs on the banks of the North Platte River. The city owns the spring and has built a ""Hobo Pool"" that is free and open 24 hrs.  There was a Mexican family there who were timid about getting in the hot water, so Kris used her excellent Spanish and helped out be telling them that ""Down here it is very cold,"" referring to the 108 degree water, then corrected herself: ""it is much less soup here.""  This was almost as helpful as when Kes' s 3+ years of college German allowed him to wave his hands randomly as a description of the Ozarks to a Swiss cyclist in Missouri.  And they say Missouri folk are kinned up. After leaving the springs, we ran into Tom and Andreas, the German whom we had met our first day on the road. He, unlike us, had stayed off the roads when there were tornado warnings in Virginia, then got sick in KY. The 7 weeks since we had last seen him had made a difference. When we fist met in Jamestown, Andreas was complaining about being out of shape.  This time, he greeted us with, ""The riding here is really easy."" From Saratoga, the riding WAS easy and we continued to see antelope almost everywhere we looked.  At Wolcott, we began a section that we had been dreading - riding on I-80 for 15 miles. We were surprised to find this riding a breeze.  There was a very wide shoulder and most of the traffic was trucks.  Throughout this entire trip, truck drivers have consistently been the safest and most friendly drivers we've encountered. As soon as we got off the interstate in Sinclair, a nasty wind kicked up from the north and we crept along, even walking on one level stretch, for the 9 miles to Rawlins. June 24 - Rawlins to Jeffrey City - 66 mi. (37 by bike) The day we should have stayed put.  The weather today started out cold and wet and just got worse. We began with a long slow climb up to a nondescript ridge where we crossed the continental divide again.  The scenery improved as we descended into the Grand Divide Basin.  Between the brutal cross wind from the east and the low-lying clouds, we couldn't pay much attention to the distant mountains.  We battled the wind to Lamont, where we ate at Grandma's cafe, the only business for miles.  There we met a southbound Dutch cyclist who is doing a huge 5 month circuit of the US that began in New York.  He is now headed for Vancouver via Los Angeles. After lunch, we stupidly set out into the rain and wind.  After 4 miles and another continental divide crossing, we called it quits and hitched a ride to Jeffrey City, pop. 100 and falling, where we are now. In the distance, it looks like there is fresh snow on the mountains. Oh boy! Also: 1. Apologies to anyone whose e-mails to us have gone unresponded to.  Even with this handy device, time and energy (& phones) for e-mail are scarce. 2. If anyone knows Chris Casey's e-mail address, please forward this to him. We should have signed him up in April, but lost his address. 3. Please forward this to anyone else who may be amused (or annoyed) by it. Cont......
"
145,"We've been reading John McFee's ""Annals of the Former World,"" a gripping history of North American geology written by a former English major.  We just missed an even greater geological treat: as our Athens friends Jim and Sandra later informed us, they'd tried to surprise us by driving the TransAmerica route between Canyon City and Frisco on their way to Winnemucca, Nev.  (Jim and Sandra are geologists, cyclists, and good friends, who made a significant detour on a slight chance.  We were in Boulder when they crossed our route, so we missed them by just 2 days.)  Anyone else who wants to track us down, be sure to bring Nutella, Preparation H and cold Miller High Life. Oh: we've had one complaint (from a family member we won't identify) that our dispatches are too critical.  If you live in the Southeast and would like the expurgated (and illustrated) version of our trip, ask at your local bike shop for a copy of ""Southeastern Cyclist."" Finally: we're not superstitious.  After boasting last time that we haven't yet had a flat, we had two today, on our worst weather day so far (Kris's rear tire, then, 13 miles later, her front tire).  The lesson is: if you can't find new Kevlar belted tires, stick to your old, worn Kevlar tires.  That's all for now... KRIS AND KES
"
146,"Way back in Kentucky, we heard a truck driver try to tell a joke: ""In Montana, they say they have two seasons: summer and the Fourth of July. Wait, I told that wrong...""  Well, it's the 4th of July, we're in Montana, and it's hot. Here's the Readers' Digest version of what we've been up to. June 25 - Jeffrey City to Lander - 60 mi. We started they day with Kris very diplomatically asking the postmaster, ""What happened to your town?""  Turns out J.C. was a uranium boom town that never panned out.  Unlike the day before, we had great weather as we traveled up and over the Beaver Divide to Lander.  There we met Rick Cain from Macon, GA who is riding from Seattle to Savannah raising money for the Middle GA Alzheimer's Council.  Lander is a cool town and is the last place we were able to camp for free. June 26 - Lander to near Dubois (Aspen Meadows Bike Hostel) - 74 mi. We traversed the Wind River Indian Reservation and eventually reached the Wind River Gorge, which lived up to its name as we struggled north to Dubois.   Amazing red and pink rock formations. It wasn't all natural wonder, though - we also passed by Gerry Spence's Trial Lawyer's College. I (Kes) banged on the gate, but they wouldn't let me in.  We spent the night in the hostel run by JoAnn and Dave Martin - Dinner, breakfast, laundry, and a spot in their 1920 cabin for $15.  The best deal on the route so far. Best meal and best night's sleep either of us has yet had. June 27 - Dubois to Grand Teton NP (Colter Bay) - 65 mi.  Fighting the wind the day before had worn us out, so we got a late start on the 21 mile climb up to Togwotee Pass (9,658'), the second highest point on our route, and definitely their hardest climb so far. Halfway down the other side, the Teton Range suddenly came into view - probably the greatest sight we've seen so far.  June 28 - Grand Teton NP - 20 mi. Took it easy and sat around looking at the mountains. We also rented a motor boat for the true lazy person's tour of Jenny Lake. June 29 - Jenny Lake to Yellowstone NP (Grant Village) - 60 mi.  Yellowstone is full of incredible things that all of you know about already.  Instead, we'll tell you about the all-you-can-eat pasta bar at Yellowstone Lake, where we watched in awe as pudgy 7 year old kept going back for more until his mother had to rush him to the bathroom holding a napkin just ahead of him saying ""don't spit! don't spit!""  If you can't eat til you puke in our national parks, then what good are they? (In the interest of full disclosure, I (Kes) must say that my mom lived in fear of exactly this scene for most of my childhood (and probably still does).) June 30 - Grant Village to West Yellowstone, MT - 53 mi.  Saw Old Faithful - a woman with camcorder told us that it was much better in the 70's.  The ride out of the park was an incredible mostly downhill glide along the Firehole and Madison Rivers. Though most of the drivers were decent, Yellowstone was the only place where traffic has been bad. July 1 - W. Yellowstone to Ennis, MT - 73 mi. W. Yellowstone has the best bike shop so far - it has a coffee bar in the shop.  A good start to a great day of riding. After riding alongside Hebgen Lake, an impoundment of the Madison, we came to Quake Lake, which was created by an earthquake in 1959. There we saw three bald eagles circling above the lake.  The rest of the day was an easy cruise along the Madison to Ennis.  After seeing scores of fishermen on the many great rivers we've crossed since Colorado (Blue, Illinois, Michigan, Encampment, Wind, Buffalo, Snake, Firehole, Madison, Platt, Sweetwater, Big Hole, Bitterroot, Beaverhead, etc. etc.) I (Kes) am ready to get a fly rod and spend some time off the bike.
"
147,"July 3 - Dillon to Wisdom - 66 mi. Montana is turning into perhaps the most difficult state we've ridden in. Today we crossed ever two passes with huge headwind - first Badger Pass (6760'), the Big Hole (7360').  After that we descended into Big Hole Valley, bounded by the Beaverhead, Anaconda, and Pioneer ranges (or something like that). We have been hearing about Big Hole and its mosquitoes for weeks from eastbound cyclists.  In the summer, much of the valley is flood irrigated for hay production - this creates great mosquito habitat and we had been warned that we wouldn't be able to stop at all because of the swarms. For once, the wind was helpful and the bugs weren't too bad. For dinner we visited the only place open - the Antlers Saloon where we joined a group of bona fide cowboys and some drunk school teachers on vacation.  We fit right in.  July 4 - Wisdom to Darby - 58 mi. Just west of Wisdom, we visited the Big Hole battlefield, where the US army killed a bunch of Nez Perce in 1877 as they tried to flee to Canada after refusing to be placed in a reservation.  After that is was a nice climb up through the forest to Chief Joseph Pass (7241') (yesterday's climbs had been through pretty barren sagebrush).  From there it was a long steep descent along the East Fork of the Bitterroot to Darby.  Along the way we came across a pack of mountain goats crossing the road. And now we're camping a trailer park/motel/campground in Darby watching rednecks blow things up. Kes and Kris
"
148,"In retrospect, when you're not pedaling into the wind, Montana is pure magic. Postscript from Kes: We just rolled into Missoula after a nice 71 mile mostly downhill mostly tailwinded ride down the Bitterroot Valley. A great day of riding, though we did have to run the gauntlet of US 12 to get into town. On the way in, we met Greg, the Art Director for Adventure Cycling Assoc. A few minutes later he met us at the ACA offices (closed today) and gave us a quick tour. We happily added our names to the roster of TransAm riders. This seems to be a nice town - at the very least, they have fish tacos.
"
149,"July 6 - Rest Day - Missoula, MT. We had a great time hanging out in Missoula an extra day. We camped both nights in the backyard of David Claman, the city's parks and trails designer, whom we met as we wandered around Saturday evening. David is responsible in part for the great bike trails that we used while we were here. Kes also officially made this tour a multi-sport event by buying fly rod and going fishin on the Clarks Fork River. Sunday morning we ran into Andreas again - he is heading up into Canada from here, so it was good to see him one last time. Overall, we give Missoula high marks - bikes are everywhere, an incredible river flows right through town, it's not full of yuppies/rednecks in SUVs (like Boulder/Athens), plus it's the home of Adventure Cycling, the folks who got us into this mess. Stage 61 - July 7 - Missoula to Lolo Hot Springs, MT - 39 mi. We were supposed to get all the way into Idaho today, but the distractions of the big city kept us in Missoula. Once we left, we followed Lolo Creek upstream to Lolo Hot Springs. The road roughly parallels part of Lewis and Clark's time on the Lolo Trail, originally an Indian route. On their way back through, L&C soaked for awhile in the springs here. Of course, that was before the concept of private property had arrived here in the Bitterroots. Nowadays, you have to pay $8 to bathe like the pioneers. We decided to skip it. We also passed on the Lewis and Clark Bumper Boats. Stage 62 - July 8 - Lolo Hot Springs to Wilderness Gateway Campground - 60 mi. We started by climbing in the cold and rain up to Lolo Pass (5,235'), the border between Montana and Idaho. From there, though, the weather cleared up and stayed mercifully cool as we followed the gorgeous Lochsa River.  Signs along the way tell travelers every detail of Lewis & Clarks' journey --where they slept, ate, bathed, trembled at the looming mountains.  Our new favorite game is to pull up in front of these signs and have a long conversation, forcing the RV drivers who pull in behind us to climb out of their RVs in order to read the signs and see the vistas.  Thus we thwart ""drive-by history.""    Stage 63 - July 9 - Wilderness Gateway CG to Kooskia - 51 mi. The Lochsa River is one of the very most beautiful along our route. We followed it on this blistering day, but took a bit of relief when Kes stopped to fish the Selway River and Kris fell into the river trying to retrieve his strike indicator and discovered that, unlike her brothers, Kes doesn't mind if she swims 10 feet from where he's fishing. Kes, however, catches no fish. We camped at the Kooskia city park on the Nez Perce Indian Reservation, where Kris's old friend Jana picked us up the next day and brought us to Moscow, Idaho, for a day off with the Argersingers. July 10 - Rest Day. The temperature reached 100+ today, so we were glad to be taking it easy with Jana and he family. One highlight was seeing Charlie's backyard observatory. Stage 64 - July 11 - White Bird Hill to Riggins - 39 mi. Today we started with an incredible descent through dozens of switchbacks from White Bird Hill to the Salmon River below. 1   the conspicuous lack of detail as to how we got to the top of the hill.    When we hit the river we needed a swim since the temperature was again over 100. The rest of the day we spent going upstream alongside the incredible Salmon to Riggins. (Cont'd - pocketmail limits us...)
"
150,"Stage 66 - July 13 - Cambridge, ID to Oxbow, OR - 41 mi. At this point, we left Lewis and Clark's route and connected with the Evil Knievel trail as we searched for the site of his ill-fated attempt in 1976(?) to jump across the Snake River Canyon. We failed in this quest, but did enjoy the ascent over the mountains and into Hell's Canyon, which we entered at Brownlee Reservoir, an impoundment of the Snake River. As we made our way down the river beyond the dam, we paused at one of the wild plum trees that line the river, but found that we were sharing the trees with a local bear. So we quietly moved on.  Stage 67 - July 14 - Oxbow, OR to Baker City, OR - 69 mi. Pure drudgery as we inched along in near 100 degree heat. If this is what being on the Oregon Trail was like, we would have given up the whole pioneer bit. But we did see a coyote. Stage 68 - July 15 - Baker City to Sumpter - 30 mi. After yesterday's long, hot ride, we just didn't have much left in our legs and stopped short in this old mining town after traveling up the Powder River Valley for a couple of hours. There is an old mining dredge on display here as the centerpiece of a state park. According to a 1953 news article on display, the dredge ""Converts Lush Valley to Rock Pile.""  This was clear as we rode past acre after acre of tailings. Sumpter was named in misspelled honor of South Carolina's Fort Sumter by confederates who moved here after the War. We felt just like we were back in Georgia  as we rode past the Jeff Davis River and  over Dixie Pass on the way the Klan Kove. (OK, we made up the last one, but the others are on the real, as we say in Athens.) Stage 69 - July 16 - Sumpter to Dayville - 89 mi. We started the day by riding over three steep passes - Sumpter, Tipton, and the aforementioned Dixie before spending the rest of the day cruising downhill for 54 miles through the John Day Valley. We have enjoyed the past two days because we have (we hope) left the high desert behind. After climbing up from Baker City, we entered fragrant pine forests that remind me (kes) of the Sierras. The John Day Valley is wide open, mostly farmland, and is framed by the Strawberry Mountains to the south and the Greenhorns to the north. In Dayville, we checked in with the Presbyterian Church, which very generously lets bikers stay in and around the church. We are doing our best to comply with the house rules, which include, ""You may sleep in the sanctuary, but please do not use the pew pads to sleep on."" Great places like this have become a favorite part of our trip.

"
152,"July 17 - Dayville, OR to Ochoco Pass - 55 mi. OH NO! WE'RE STILL IN THE DESERT! This quickly became obvious as we began the 33 mile climb up to Keyes Creek Pass. We were out of the Rockies, but not out of the mountains. The first part of the climb was incredible, though, as we passed through Picture Canyon and the John Day Fossil Beds. For several miles through the canyon, sheer cliffs rose on both sides of us as we traveled upstream along the John Day River, then Mountain Creek. After the pass, we took a brief break in Mitchell for lunch (the third straight day of Kes' chili-cheeseburger diet). After Mitchell, we had a few miles of downhill before beginning the steep 10 mile ascent to Ochoco Pass. Near the top of the climb, we met (and were passed by) three (hyperactive) Williams College students who had crossed the country in less than 6 weeks - about double our speed. As they sped downhill in the dusk, we settled in for the night at the Ochoco Pass campground, which we had pretty much to ourselves for $4 each. July 18 - Ochoco Pass to Sisters - 76 mi. The heat wave continued unabated, but finally the high peaks of the Cascades were in view. Near Prineville, Mt. Jefferson suddenly emerged from the horizon. A quick swim in the Deschutes River near Redmond gave us some relief from the heat shortly before Sisters, a nice touristy town at the base of the Cascades.  July 19 - Sisters to McKenzie Bridge - 47 mi. From Sisters, we had good views of the town's namesake mountains as well as Mts. Jefferson and Washington. We were excited about today's ride because it would take us up and over McKenzie Pass (5,324'), our last major climb. From Sisters, we quickly started climbing through pine forest until the final mile, when the forest suddenly ended and we looked out on dark, cracked lava fields nearly as far as we could see in every direction. The observatory at the top of the pass gave us great views of the Cascades. Downhill of the pass, we observed the dramatic differences between the eastern and western slopes of the Cascades. No longer were we looking on dry, sparse forests; west of the Cascades we rode through dense woods of huge trees and ferns. Of course we were more interested in flying downhill than in a botany lesson and quickly arrived at the blue McKenzie River. It was an exhilarating, gorgeous descent, but also a bit sad, as this would be our last such zoom down a mountain into a new landscape. Continued....
"
153,"July 21 - Eugene to Corvallis - 44 mi. Another hot, mostly uneventful day.  We encountered strong headwinds, a preview of the conditions we'd find as we headed up the Oregon coast. Corvallis is a great town, though, that has been recognized as being bike-friendly by the League of American Bicyclists. July 22 - Corvallis to Rose Lodge - 66 mi. More of the same as we rode through hot winds over the Coastal Range. We were wrong when we thought that McKenzie Pass had been our last climb. This last range continued to throw short steep climbs at us up to the end. The scenery in the Willamette Valley was pretty, though: we rode past golden patches of wheat and hay, alternating with green fields of mint and alfalfa.  We also enjoyed a last look at Mt. Jefferson until we turned westward.  In Rose Lodge we camped at the delightful Salmon River RV park, where the manager told us that the previous night's excitement had been ""just like on 'Cops.'"" July 23 - Rose Lodge to Cape Lookout - 42 mi. This was a fantastic day. We woke up to cool temperatures, the first in weeks. After a scenic ride through the lush coastal forest, we emerged at the Pacific Ocean in Neskowin, where we paused on the beach just long enough to coat our chains with sand and saltwater. As we rode north, we agreed that the Oregon Coast was our new favorite part of the trip.  July 24 - Cape Lookout to Manzanita - 47 mi. More great riding along the coast. Unlike back east, the topography along the Pacific is not gentle. Our riding here varied from riding virtually at water's edge to traversing cliffs  hundreds of feet above the shore.  At the state park campground, we met about a dozen other bike tourists, including a Swiss couple who were on the way to Tierra del Fuego from Anchorage. July 25 - Manzanita to Seaside - 26 mi. July 26 - Seaside to Astoria - 20 mi. These two days we slowed down to enjoy the final few miles of the trip. The coast here is everything that it's cracked up to be. On the way to Astoria, we stopped at Fort Clatsop, where the Lewis & Clark expedition wintered before heading back east. Unlike Lewis & Clark, we aren't going back the way we came. We are now on the way to San Diego for Kes' sister Louisa's wedding. For the past several days, we've been in the lap of luxury in Hood River thanks to former Athenian Johnson Dunn and his fiancé Laura Scobie and in Portland thanks to Rhett Lawrence and Leeann Friedman. Thanks for tuning in for the past few months. We are amazed that 95 people have signed up for this list and others have been reading our forwarded narratives. We have had an incredible time doing this ride and recommend it to anyone who rides, and even those who don't (yet). You don't have to be in the best of shape, you don't need an expensive bike, and you don't need touring experience.  There are plenty of resources (maps, especially) available for would-be bike tourists, and as we've discovered, an impressive number of folks along the way who are eager to share their hospitality with long-distance cyclists.  We have met people along the way whom we now count among our friends and plan to keep as friends.  So do consider a bike tour for yourselves; it's one of the best uses you can make of your time and money.  We hope to put some photos up on the web before long, and once we do, we'll send you the address.  Kris and Kes  Copyright © 2003 - Kristin Boudreau and Kesler T. Roberts

154,"The group I went with had as a main aim to ride 'La Marmotte'. A 175 kms  ride with 5000 metres of climbing in The Alps. This was on the 5th of July, the day the Tour de France started in Paris.  At 70 I thought the long ride would be too far for me, so I had as my main aims, to firstly have my photo taken on the Avenue Des Champs Elysees, and secondly to ride up Alpe du Huez, but after much training, and getting my weight down to my lightest for 40 years, I had some hopes.  Unfortunately three of us fell off our bikes in Paris  on the 28th of June, I was able to ride Alpe du Huez, with a great deal of effort, but too injured to ride La Marmotte. The following are the e-mails I sent home from France.   "
155,"   29/06 On Sunday morning we had out photos taken at the foot of the Arc de Triomphe on the Avenue Des Champs  Elysees - we made a big impression as three of us went down - seemed like oil on the road that we did not see and our wheels just went out from under us. One with two broken bones (Peter) and the other two (James and me) pretty sore with bruises and lacerations. I came out of it not too bad. Walked around Paris in the afternoon to see the Bastille, Notre Dame and a small cathedral (St Severin) nearby.    30/06 Monday we went to the Tour de France exhibition in the Hotel de Ville, where the tour starts - great historical display. Then along to the Louvre and then onto a boat down to the Eiffel Tower to go right to the top - spectacular     "
156,"      02/07 Wednesday was crunch day - Don and I set out to ride Alpe du Huez, I made it so both my aims have been fulfilled. Some bad news when we got back - Keiran had been taken to hospital after falling on a bend down-hilling - pretty sore and a broken rib and a neck brace.The hotel is really great - Don, James and I share a room and we are having a good time. Internet facilities scarcer than hens teeth.      03/07 Thursday we all drove up Alpe du Huez to register, including the walking wounded. Everyone getting worried about gearing(triples everywhere). 04/07 Friday trued wheels and adjusted gearing (I seem to be the resident mechanic) everyone going lower.    05/07 Saturday I could not ride La Marmotte (too sore). Kahn got a gold- James a silver and Don did a good job to finish the 161km ride. 06/07 drove to Annecy, a beautiful place. Plenty of rides around the lake or the hills for the next 2 days- very old town with narrow alleys and ancient buildings.
"
157,"07/07 Wednesday early start to Chamonix-Mont Blanc-I cannot start to describe the awesome size of Europe's biggest mountain. We rode a two stage cablecar up to Aiguille Du Midi at 3842 metres. The grandeur is overwhelming. A bit of shopping then back to Annecy.      Annecy is a great place for cycle touring, with many mapped out rides in the surrounding mountains, also some flat rides around the lake. Don and I went for a ride along the lake in one direction, stopping at a delightful village called St.Bernard, for a coffee break, then back along the lake in the other direction. A lovely 60k ride.     "
158,"   11/07 down to the stage finish, we went early to make sure of a top spot, between the 50 and 25 metre marks (front row) we got there at 11-30am and the race didn't finish until about 5-00pm.     O'grady put up a great breakaway ride, but got caught 1km to go after around 200km's out front with one other rider. Baden Cooke was second to the Italian Petecchi who had now won 4 stages. Mc Ewan fell with about 1k to go.    12/07 Watched start of the next stage (a bit of a dead loss) then left Lyon at 11-00 am for the Alpe Du Huez stage tomorrow. Got caught in a massive road block, it took 6hours 40 mins to travel 160km's. Our accommodation was on a mountain called Les Deu Alpes. We had a great team dinner on the balcony.   "
159,"   13/07 Bit more about the Alpe Du Huez stage. It is a great social event, everyone seems to join in the fun- we had a young Frenchman behind us with a trumpet, now and then he would play ""de-dum-de-dah"" and the whole mountain would respond, it was great.    The riders came through in dribs and drabs (great to see the effort these good riders had to put in to climb the mountain).       Michael Rogers rode really well in bringing Richard Verenque up on his wheel.     McEwan was way off the back but couldn't resist doing a couple of mono's as he came by. Just as well we had gone up the back road, as the traffic jams were horrific on the front of the mountain, with the police just throwing their hands in the air and walking off.
"
160,"  15/07 shopping then a tourist ride around town - many old sights to be noted-Marseille was founded in 600B.C.-the main French port and the 3rd most important in Europe. The most prominent land mark is the Basilica Notre Dame De La Garde which stands on a hill overlooking the city. There is a statue of the blessed virgin on top standing 10 meters tall covered in gold leaf.      For the hill climbers the slope of the hill is 18%(people live here). Our tour driver told us not to be frightened of the perilous slope as 'Our lady is watching over us!' Once on top he told us to start worrying, as she's stopped watching. 16/07 a ferry ride to the Chateau D'if, a fortress island then on to the Iles Du Frioul Island for our first swim in the Mediterranian. A quiet afternoon then a farewell dinner for the group.       17/07 only five of us left. Don, Julie and I had a bus tour while James and Kahn returned our hire car. Busy packing for an early start tomorrow.
"
161,"A long story but we finished up coming home through Tokyo, leaving our bags and bikes in London.  Home midday 21/07, still in the same clothes that we put on at 6.00am Friday. An unusual end to a great experience
"
162,"  Why in the world would someone want to ride a bike across the country?  More than that, why would happily married couple want to ride the same bike across the country?  Well, I don't know, but we are going to do it.  The idea of riding across the country has been in Jen's mind for a long time, and in mine since we met.  The plan really started to hatch two summers ago when we were living with our friend Steve and Louis in western NC.  They had done a good bit of touring and had a pile of ""Adventure Cyclists"" magazines laying around.  Riffling through those magazines really got us thinking.  We were heading to Clemson for our masters degrees and thought that a cross country ride would be a good after school experience.  So, we deliberated about how we would get across and came up with the idea of a tandem.  Our friends Todd and Therese, and Charles and Lisa had both done alot of tandem touring and encouraged us.  We borrowed Charles' bike for a few rides and decided we would go tandem.  We found a great deal at Tandems LTD. in Birmingham, AL on a 2001 Burley Duet.  We picked it up and took it home to Clemson.  At this point we really felt pretty committed to the trip. Since we got the bike, we really have been letting it collect dust.  I think we have ridden it about 200 miles or so.  Our plan is to train alot here in April, but we'll see.  We both have to defend our theses and then we have to move, and do all sorts of other stuff.  I guess we will just have to train on the way.  I hope we can do a bit of a shakedown trip between now and then.
"
163,"  We will be staying north and following the Lake Erie connector route along the north shore of Lake Erie in Ontario,     then connecting with the North Lakes route and riding through the Upper Penninsula of Michgan, to connect back with the Northern Tier in Wisconson.    The route is about 4,400 miles in total.  Our plan is to average about 75 miles per day, equaling about 58 days of riding.  This gives us plenty of slack time to make our 70 day time limit.  We plan on stopping off route a few times to see friends.  The first stop will be at our friends the Schuster's in Syracuse, then Jen's aunt Laura in Minneapolis, then our friends we know from Clemson Lauren and Ryan in Spokane.  Lauren's parents also have a cabin outside of Glacier that we will probably stop at.   Neither Jen or I have been to pretty much any state on the route, except NY, MN, and WA.  I am really excited about the route.  I hope the bugs don't eat us alive.

170,"We made it to New Hampshire! When people ask where we started the trip, I feel a little better about saying Bar Harbor, now that we aren't in Maine. Just seems to lend a little credence to our journey. The whole way through Maine, I kept thinking, ""Maine is NOT flat."" Why had I previously imagined that it is, I do not know. Rest assured, there are significant (beautiful) hills in Maine. The coastline is charming. The farmhouses are grand and are usually attached to barns with woodsheds. Don't imagine a 10'x20' shed here. I'm thinking of a two story, packed full with wood wing of the home - really something! We have seen several postings for ""woodsplitters for rent,"" I understand why! Today is a rest day as we have our most significant Eastern climb tomorrow. I cannot explain what a pleasure it was to sleep in a bed - with sheets - last night! My back and behind had really been hurting a lot, which made last night all the sweeter. I hope to write some postcards, journal and find chapstick with sunscreen today. I think we may actually end up riding partway up the mountain so we can camp for free tonight. The hostel was wonderful, but $40 - OUCH! More than we expected, needless to say. I am becoming more and more of a morning person. I wake up at 5:30, but go back to sleep till 6:00, when the alarm goes off nearly every morning. I am ready to ride! I love riding in the morning! However, Drew has been saintly, when nearly every afternoon at about 4:45, I feel like mush. Psychologically, I just feel spent and would either cry or yell at anything. I have begun to identify the onset of my exhaustion, though, and am making it. By about 5:15, I feel much better! I am looking forward to Ben & Jerry's in Vermont! There are some things we just shouldn't pass up. Give me all the chocolate you can fit in a pint! "
171,"http://www.courierpub.com/articles/2004/05/21/camdenherald/local_news/story3.txt Here's something we never expected on the trip! A newspaper reporter stopped us on our second day at a local bike shop and asked to join us for lunch. We needed a break and here's what became of it...Enjoy! We have ridden about 60 miles and climbed 2 major mountain passes (2,000 feet vertical gain each). Now, it's over the Connecticut River to Vermont, just 8 more miles today.
"
172,"Ooh! We had our first dog incident on Tuesday in Lee Center, New York. Scared the pants off me,  and I'm a dog person!  We were riding along looking at homes with an eye open for dogs, because we'd seen many on chains. This dog was in a fence (4 1/2' - 5'), but lunged for us. Then in one amazing leap this smallish Pit Bull leapt over the fence and was after us! We flew without a word! You just can't imagine the acceleration. Finally I turned around and began screaming at the top of my lungs - anything to startle this vicious dog! For whatever reason, it gave up the chase. Not 200 feet later ANOTHER dog came running, growling and barking. But, by this point I had had it. We stopped the bike, and I pulled out our Chacos ready to pummel this dog if it persisted. We walked the bike until the dog was nearly hit by a car and sprinted home. Many reading know that I LOVE DOGS, and my tone likely seems harsh here, but the nicest dog can flip into alter ego when spinning bike tires and rotating feet go whishing by! Frankly, I have never been so scared of a dog in my life. I sincerely hope that is the last scary dog story we will have to tell.  I'm really excited to visit Niagara Falls before too long. Just one of those visits every American ought to make. On our way there, we will get to ride along the Erie Canal bike path. I'm very excited to be off major roads for Memorial Day weekend! Have a safe and fun weekend!"
173,"The messages everyone has been leaving on the guesbook have been incredibly encouraging!  Please keep them coming.  It has been great to hear from so many people from the ""old school"" times back in I-town.  I look forward to hooking up with y'all when we get back to Texas.  Thanks everyone!"

175,"On memorial day, at around 5:00pm, We crashed our bike going over a metal drawbridge in Port Dover, Ontario, Canada (eh).  The bridge unbeknownst to us was wet and slippery and when we rode over it the slightest turn of the wheel caused the bike to slip out from underneath us.  We both hit the bridge pretty hard.  I have a broken thumb and Jen has stiches in her lips, cracked teeth, and a concussion (with significant short term memory loss that is much improved today).  We are recovering at a gracious couples house here in Port Dover (the husband Jim was right behind us when we went down and took care of our bike when we were in the hospital).  We are choosing to put the trip on hold indefinately and return to Texas.   Look for more later with cool ER pics of Jen and the x-ray of my thumb. Love y'all"
176,"Our new friend Jim Mcallum was driving right behind us and, with his wife Sharon, have been Godsends.  He looked after Jen while the ambulance came (he's an ex-firefighter) and took our bike and gear to his house.  Then they picked us up from the hospital and put us up for a night!  A police man was right behind Jim.  The ambulance was there in about 4 minutes! In the hospital, the extent of Jen's memory loss was revealed to me.  She could not remember where we were or how we got there or what we were doing.  It was even scarier that I would tell her all that stuff and then it was like somebody wiped the chalkboard clean and she couldn't remember it anymore.  This continued for about 4-5 hours that night.  I was xrayed and determined to have a broken thumb (see below).  Jen was admitted for the night so that they could monitor her progress.  All told, it was scary to see Jen's memory loss, but the hospital was great and very kind.   Jen recoverd well that night and was clear headed.  She remembers everything now except for about a 8 hour window around the accident.  Jim and Sharon came and picked us up and took us to their house to recover.  I began to make plans to get home.  Another way God was looking after us was letting us meet Brenda and David from MBS Tandems in Toronto.  We had met them the day before in Niagara.  We ended up meeting up with Brenda at Niagara and then her family put us up for the next night (wednesday night) and she dropped us off at the airport on thursday.  They are also going to ship our bike home.  It's just amazing how God laid out the plan and the people.   We are now in Greenville, TX recovering and dealing the (evil) insurance company.  This has been the biggest trouble yet.  We are lucky to have insurance, it's just not very good.  We are trusting in God to provide for our needs in this.  We are praying now that God would be glorified in this as well as the rest of our summer.  Please drop us a line if God is using this story in your life, it would be an encouragement. Enjoy the following pictures.  Some of the ones of Jen are a bit bloody, but not to bad.          The following pictures are from the ER and show Jen's mouth and her the cuts on her lip.  They are a bit graphic.       "

Jen and I have had a busy and long summer recovering and then traveling to see family and friends.  We are both fully recoverd now.  I had surgery on my thumb and 2 permanent screws put in and Jen had three teeth rebuilt and is still suffering from a sprained left hand.  We have been biking again.  But we saw some touring cyclists near Steamboat Spring, CO while visiting my parents and we both (Jen especially) had a very hard time seeing them and refelcting on what we should have been doing.   We have bought a house in College Station and are looking forward to starting school in the fall.  Thank you all for the support on our guestbook.  Part II of this adventure will certainly continue at a later (unknown) time."
178,"We had to wait until the 9:15 train was loading as bikes are not allowed on the train during rush hour. As the train sped us away from Burlington we guiltily justified our comfort by remembering all the times we had ridden on this stretch of the Waterfront Trail. This trail follows the Canadian shore of Lake Ontario with a few breaks in the section we were to pedal today. Part of the reason for the train ride. The train dropped us off in Oshawa at 11:30 It didn't take long to get off the trail but no problem as we knew the area pretty well and found our way to Hwy 2 and got out of town. The road was lightly travelled and had a good shoulder so we were happy. Cemeteries seem inviting with their grass and trees so we took advantage of one we came upon to take a break and have lunch. As we neared Newcastle we were back on the Waterfront Trail proper and travelled right along the lakeshore. The large, shady marina was worth a stop but things were very quiet. It was nice to look at the boats anyway. We were feeling very out of shape as we worked our way along the rolly road. Climbing a long hill out of Port Hope used up our energy so we flopped out on a grassy bank. We hadn't been there very long when a cyclist came by and stopped for a chat. He lived in the town and ran a cycle touring business that took people riding in New Zealand, his wife's birthplace. Refreshed we had no trouble covering the few miles to Cobourg. We have camped here before and enjoy being in the centre of town at the town docks. The campground is surrounded by a tall hedge giving some privacy but we are only steps from the main street of a pretty and interesting town."
179,"The tailwind was helping us more than we realized as the miles rolled by. Such peaceful country with many farms, lots of apple orchards and forest with the lake always nearby. Shortly after passing through Picton, a fair sized town with good shopping, we took the free ferry that put us back on the mainland. It was easy not to realize we had been riding on an island for a few hours. The waterway seperating it's western end had been a narrow canal. It was getting late and we were getting tired. About ten minutes down the road from the ferry dock we came upon a nice park with a campground. A minor disappointment... due to a plumbing problem the showers were out of order."
180,"The trail today is on a highway with a wide shoulder that runs along Adolphus Reach, a sheltered body of water connected to Lake Ontario. It is a sailing mecca and we were treated to a variety of boats, many obviously set up for travelling. The land became more and more rocky; limestone and shale, with low cliffs along the water. As we got closer to Kingston I felt an ominous bumping followed by a ""pop"". As I was fixing my flat I was shocked to see the tire was seperating at the bead and as I pumped it up the tube was peeking through. As the wheel turned the tube rubbed against the brake pads. I took the cable off to open them and we rode off slowly hoping to find somewhere to pick up a new tire. Ten miles later coming into the city we came upon a Walmart. It might be a well kept secret but at the western edge of Kingston is a large park with a city run campground. It is ideally situated for visiting this very interesting area. A bike path leads right into the city with lots of chances to go into various neighbourhoods. Most of the public buildings and many older homes are built of the local limestone. After setting up the tent we put our panniers inside and took the bike path in the direction of the Kingston waterfront. It is where all the action is. This is a university town as well as the site of a military college so there are lots of young people about. The views along the waterfront and the old buildings made us glad to be there. We stopped in a local library and got some computer time. I was trying to send some e-mail to our kids but did something to the computer that made the librarian angry so we phoned them.  A marvelous deli supplied us with the makings for our supper which we took back to the campground, then a shower and to bed exhausted."
181,"We rode away from the lake on a good road, but hilly. After a couple of hours we came to the Cataraqui Trail, a rail trail that goes from Napanee in the west to Smith Falls in the east, the way we were going. It was pleasant riding; level but a bit bumpy. The trail looked like it hadn't been used much lately as it was a bit overgrown with two tracks for our wheels. Even so it was welcome as an alternative to the hilly highway. The scenery was very pleasant with many small lakes and ponds. We came upon Chaffey's Lock at a little after 2:00 and as it was too beautiful to pass up we stopped for the day. No one else was there except the lock master who was glad of the company. As long as you arrive under your own power, or in a boat, you may stay at the locks overnight. There is a modest charge to camp but it can be a bargan as some of the locks are in Ottawa. There was no boat traffic as the system was shut down due to high water levels and very strong currents in some areas because of recent rains. We had a lot of fun swimming and being carried downstream."
182,"A few hours of farms and fields brought us back to the waterway at Merrickville where we had a visit with the lock attendant. The town was attractive and interesting. We were intrigued by a local inn and decided to have lunch. It was like dining in a museum. Very elegant and as we were practically the only customers I wandered about with my video camera recording the decor. It was pretty tough, mentally, to get on our bikes and pedal the afternoon away. As we approachd Kemptville we stopped by a field where several donkies were romping. The farmer came by and gave us a lot of information about these animals which were a hobby for him. Getting closer to Ottawa the traffic became much heavier. We decided to stop at Rideau River Provincial Park but couldn't believe it when we found the gates locked. Left our bikes outside and walked in to see if we could find out the problem as we didn't want to carry on with the prospect of handling rush hour traffic. Explaining our concerns to a lady ranger who wondered what we were doing in her park, she said she would talk to her boss. She returned a few minutes later with the good news that since we had biked there and were so tired we could stay. There was no water; the reason the park was closed, but we could use the pit toilets and as we had enough water with us we could manage. It was not easy picking a campsite when you have the whole park to choose from."
183,"The secondary roads into the city were free of traffic and the riding was very pleasant. Lucked into a gas station with restaurant that featured a great breakfast for $2.99. We sat at a table outside and enjoyed the early morning quiet. We stopped at Burnt Rapid Lock on the city outskirts and chatted with the attendant. He suggested that since there was not much privacy at the next locks we might consider checking at one of the universities. We carried on along the canalside trail and soon arrived at Carleton University. The campus has a beautiful site along the Rideau River on the entrance to Ottawa with many parks in the vicinity. We found the office for the residences and booked a room for the next two nights. Although it was too early to move in we were allowed to leave our panniers. It was a treat to ride without them.  The government has a large experimental farm nearby so we paid it a visit. We had a tour of the dairy barn given by an enthusiastic young lady who knew all the cows. We learned so much but were particularly interested in the birthing suite where cows about to deliver were kept. Supper was at an elegant, inexpensive Indian restaurant then we watched a high school grad class gather at a nearby hotel for their prom."
184,"As we got on to the Colonel By parkway, which is closed to traffic on Sundays in the summer, we joined hordes of walkers, runners, skaters, and cyclists. The road follows the Rideau River into the centre of the city and to the Parliament Buildings. We enjoyed the ride and made our way to Rideau Hall in time to see ""our regiment"" on parade. The military band and the troops in their traditional uniforms were very impressive. The afternoon was spent at the National Art Gallery and on the grounds of the capitol which overlook the Ottawa River. There was a street ribfest on Sparks Street but we chose a streetside patio restaurant in the Byward Market for supper and watched the people passing. By the time we got back to our dorm we were exhausted and looking forward to some days of restful cycling."
185,"A cold front had passed through overnight clearing the air but dropping the temperature so we started off in sweaters. Traffic was not too bad so we got into the countryside quite easily. Rode quiet roads and arrived in Smiths Falls at noon. We had already covered almost 70 kms so we took a break at the lock which was very busy. The town had something else to offer. It is the home of the Canadian Hershey chocolate plant so we took a tour and stocked up. By the time we got back on the road the traffic was getting heavy, partly also because we were approaching Perth. We were not going in to town but turned off to Beveridges Lock. This is not on the main waterway but serves some small lakes in the area. It was a lovely setting and we enjoyed sharing it with a bunch of local kids who were using the area for swimming. By early evening we were alone. Even the lock master went home."
186,"Eventually we were released to the smoothness of a nice highway with a wide shoulder which took us without any drama to the spot where we had first encountered the Cataraqui Trail. This time we rode it in the other direction. This section was in better codition than the part we used on our way to Ottawa. It was wider and smoother and obviously had more use. We passed by many lakes, some  with cottages or camps and as the day had become very hot and humid we took advantage and had a couple cooling dips. As the afternoon wore on we were trying to decide which of the two conservation areas marked on our map would be our camping spot for the night. As we looked fruitlessly for the first one we came upon some local people out for a walk and asked directions from them. They looked at our map and shocked us by telling us that no areas existed as the map showed. No campgrounds for miles, no motels, no B & Bs. I was ready to set up the tent near the trail but my wife would have none of that. Then one of our new friends remembered a motel that was near Napanee not much out of our way. My wife said ""We'll take it"". ""Not much out of our way"" was further than we thought but we eventually arrived with great relief. It was really very nice. Older but well kept. Out of a dozen units we only had one neighbour who didn't know how they ended up there as they found it while lost. We put the kitchenette to good use. It felt strange watching the TV news and being brought back into the everyday world. We hadn't missed it at all."
187,"Looks like we would have a headwind today and a ride along an old highway with mostly local traffic. It had some interest as it passed through apple orchard country and a few nice communities. Eventually we encountered the Waterfront Trail and got back to Lake Ontario. As the day became hot and humid we stopped for a swim, a short one as the water was very cold.  We pushed on knowing a nice spot was waiting for us in Cobourg. Arriving at 6:30 we hurriedly put up the tent then dashed to a supermarket where we rewarded ourselves with fresh strawberries and cream to add to our dinner.  Since we had last been in Cobourg the carnival had arrived. It was set up out on the pier jutting into the lake. A very dramatic setting epecially after dark when the rides were lit up and busy. We were too tired to be bothered by all the activity and slept well.
"
188,"We were heading out of town a little after 8:00 in much better shape than when we arrived a bit more than a week ago. The riding was easy and enjoyable along the trail. The worst climb of the day was in the first hour and we handled it well, walking the top part of it because we wanted to. The trail markings became confusing near Newcastle and we ended up on highway 2 which was still acceptable. We made good time on this road in spite of off and on rain showers and rolled into Oshawa about 1:30 which was poor timing as we had to wait until after 5:30 to get our bikes on the train. We hung out at a Pizza Hut for awhile then meandered through town.  Good thing the trip was almost over as my bike had pulled a spoke through the rim and consequently had a wobble and my wife's rear tire had a bulge developing. We sat contentedly at the GO station and waited for our train which would whisk us along the lakeshore through Toronto and on to Burlington where it would drop us a few blocks from home."
189,"""Never, never, never give up."" I think it was Churchhill who said this. This is my new motto. Well, almost . . . if at some point I can't stand up, I suppose I'll have to give up. And I'm traveling with my father - - if he can't stand up, I might have to give up then, too. But otherwise, ""never, never, never give up!!!!""  Yeah, that's it - - I just have to remember that while I'm pedaling. Yup. I'm hoping to get three main results out of this, really: first, of course, is the spiritual/pilgrimage aspect. It's really something else to look back down the road, thinking of where you started and how far you've come without having given so much as a dime to Exxon or Conoco.   I'm hoping to learn something about myself, my determination, my body from this. Long hours of time to think always did me a service. I expect I'll have plenty of those. And mountains, mountains . . . they speak to my heart. It always feels like such a shame to trample over them in an automobile, with no time to let them calm your nerves, release all your worries and fears. I'm really looking forward to crossing the US and Canadian Rockies on my own power, with time to see and feel and smell and listen and reflect.  It is this love for the outdoors, for nature, which really drives me to constantly seek the most pristine, remote, and untouched beautiful places I can find. Wyoming drew me to it as a place to study largely for this reason. But Alaska stands in my mind, although I've not yet seen it, as a great deal closer to what I'm really looking for. And thus I have my destination and a second major motivation for this trip. I want to see Alaska. Of course I have a third and perhaps slightly less sappy, more feet-on-the-ground reason for this trip: this one's physical. Beside wanting to release a little residual aggression leftover from the last guy I was seeing, I always want to be in bettter shape. I end up stuck in a middle ground between my girl friends who are often much less athletic than I and the guys I can't keep up with. Maybe I'll catch up to a couple of them! And it never hurts to lose a little chub and shape up a bit. I really want to press my body to see what I can get from it. I want to make it do what I want it to do!! And even though I joke about the miseries of riding (and some days even feel them . . .), I really do enjoy cycling! June 2003"

192,"motel We had a good start to our trip today but really overdid it. I could barely hold back the tears of frustration and complete fatigue as we lumbered up the Centennial Trail to get to a phone where we had promised we would call Mom. Otherwise, we would've just pitched the tent somewhere on the trail. Instead, we ended up riding along the trail (a rails-to-trails path) well after dark in the middle of the woods on the sides of the mountains with no headlights. Dad got out a little flashlight which he shined up the path in front of him a bit, but I was just blindsighting it. That was really really stupid and dangerous. I'm going to get a headlight asap, and we'll need to improve our planning!  Dad was thinking we could make it to Spearfish - - he had seen something on a map which he though was a distance of about 60 miles to Spearfish - - but it's closer to 100 miles! We ended up in a hotel in Lead for lack of a better solution. We started from my parents' place near Rapid City.             "
193,"Spearfish City Campground We're staying in Spearfish tonight - - hoping to still get caught up from yesterday and pre-trip lack of sleep. The ride today was nice - - a few miles of killer uphill on the way out of Lead, then 30 miles of downhill in Spearfish Canyon. We'll try for more miles tomorrow. Had Italian dinner at Lynne's sister's restaurant (called Roma's). It was pretty good, but a bit pricey. (Lynne was my university adviser.) Stopped in at the Two Wheeler Dealer to pick up a couple of things - - I got a new spare tube since by old one already had 2 patches on it. I suppose I could've kept using it, but I thought I'd get off to a better start with a fresh one.  I also got a cheap headlight for emergencies so we don't end up riding in the dark again like last night.     "
194,"Weyer Motel Tough ride today! Ha ha . . . NOT! We didn't plan this out very well and didn't think we could make in anywhere useful, so we found a hotel for $32 in Belle Fourche. We're going to try to make Broadus, MT tomorrow - - 96 miles from here. Should be a challenge - - a long day for sure. We've reserved a hotel room for tomorrow night. At least there'll be a light at the end of the tunnel! :)  I was feeling really good today. Hope I've still got the edge tomorrow. Off to sleep . . .
"
195,"motel We got out of Belle Fourche by 7 this morning and rode the 39 miles to Alzada, MT where we took a break at the gas station. Then after the next 30 miles we stopped at Hammond (not much more than a post office) to snooze for 1.5 hours beside the close post office. We then went on to Broadus . . . to arrive at about 7pm. That made 12 hours total - - but really we were moving along quite well. Dad's computer read 7:56 total ride time and 11.9 mph as our average speed - - and this should be a bit low (his computer isn't set quite right). Anyway, I felt pretty good today. I'm good and tired, but not a dead as I was Wednesday. And I certainly never got exhausted to tears today! :)  Actually, I didn't really get that tired during the ride - - just sore in the backside, lower back, and hands. The terrain and weather was really good for the most part - - rolling hills, light breeze, sunny, and bearably warm. Lucky for our first century!     So I had way too much to eat at dinner tonight, and now I'm going to sleep. Dad's already konked. :)       "
196,"Motel 6 Hello again!! Another long day - - WE CAN DO IT!!!  Today was pretty tough for me though. It was pretty hilly - - roller-coaster-ish for much of the way, and then the wind picked up. It wouldn't have been so rough if I had had more time to recover from yesterday. A few extra hours of sleep would have helped, anyway. But it went OK all the same. Better than the first day, still. :)  I'm not really having problems with any particular muscle fatigue - - just general exhaustion, and then my hands, lower back, and butt are hurting. I'm getting a bit of a rash on my bum - - I'll have to try the baby powder idea. We'll be resting here tomorrow though; maybe it'll have a chance to recover a bit.  I think there should be two different horns installed on vehicles: the  ""hi""/encouragement horn and the ""f*ck you"" horn. It would be a lot easier to know why people are honking at us . . .  We stopped at Volborg today . . . just a few houses with a post office-ish thing where a lady sells a few beverages and snacks. It was nice to have a break though. The lady was very friendly - - she sounded a little bored with being her own town. ""Yeah,"" she says, ""I like cities."" And this was after a conversation about Miles City, Rapid City . . . mere towns to most of the folks I know! Time to sleep. :)"
197,"Motel 6 We took the day off to rest today . .. just a few miles of riding across town. We were ready for a rest!  There's not much to do in town. We managed to get into our e-mail at the library, and then spent a little time at Walmart getting a few supplies - - picked up some medicated baby powder and baby ointment for our bums in hopes of relieving the pain a bit. Hope it works!!   We also decided to try some generic muscle rub. Dad's had some sore muscles. I'm really not having a problem with that - - I'm pretty surprised.
"
198,"Montana Inn We still felt like we hadn't had the best rest of our lives today, but went on anyway . . . and had a great ride. It felt really good. I felt like I was almost bouncing along . We rode alongside the interstate today . . . it was surprisingly pleasant. I figured the traffic would make it rather miserable. But the gentle grades , double lanes, and wide shoulders more than made up for the traffic. We stopped in Forsyth for a light day . . . it's amazing how light it felt!! Stayed at the Montana Inn. It was decent and pretty cheap, but the a/c was the noisiest I've yet heard!  Anyway, stopped at the library for e-mail and then had dinner at the Rails Inn Restarant (good place), then rested up to head out early in the morning.   "
199,"Ideal Motel Another long ride today - - too much space between towns out here! I started out feeling pretty groggy and tired. It was a long ride! Kicked my @ss! I really didn't have any more left in me when we stopped at Roudnup this evening. We did get to break for lunch at Ingomar today - - it's a prairie ghost town with a little restaurant/bar and bunk house which we hadn't previously known about or would have planned to stay there! We wanted to get a few more miles in today though. But Ingomar was a fun stop.  We stopped for a second little break at Melstone.  I'm surprised at how friendly people are - - the drivers are really polite about slowing down and leaving us plenty of space whenever possible. They're probably more polite than I would be!  Dad thinks some of the rancher types are pretty brash, but I don't find them terribly unfriendly even so. I think there's a jinx on the last ten miles of any day's ride. There's always got to be something to just test your true limits - - just to make sure you're really worthy of that century. Today it was gravel construction, wind, and some good uphills. Oie! We stopped at the grocery to get a bit of water and food - - the water here is disgusting. It smells to me like tractors. Don't drink it!! Anyway, I'm going to crash now!!                     "
200,"Ideal Motel We took another day off today to rest . . . we were really beat after yesterday's ride. We had lunch at a place downtown, then spent some time running around town (not much to the town, really), and using the computers at the library, which is a shared community/school library in the high school. And we had another A&W Root Beer Float. :)  Good stuff . . ."
201,"Corral Motel Well, we're at 531 miles after 10 days total. That's not too bad .. . I was hoping for an average of 50-60 miles as we started out. I feel like I've hit that part I was dreading though -- the second week or so when I'm just tired out and can't seem to get caught up. I'm just hoping I can make it over the next couple of days and that I'll catch up. This is part of the physical/pilgrimage challenge that I wanted to put myself up against to see if I could overcome it. I've also had a really really sore backside today . . . I don't know what to do about that.  I called this morning to Big Sky Cyclery in Helena to have them order in some gel handlebar inserts and Cinelli gel tape to see if I can ease up the pressure on my hands. I'm not having such troubles with the Ulnar as I was having last year, but I'm really trying to be careful to avoid it. Last summer I got to where I could hardly move two of my smaller fingers (I think it was right hand). It seems to help that I've been changing positions a lot between the drops, the tops of the bars, the corners, and the aerobars. I've also been riding on the gel armrests of my aerobars a lot - - they're really padded and really seem to help, but they're not a very good shape. Hopefully the handlebar things will be worth the $40-50. Today's ride was pretty pleasant, except for the bum thing and the last few miles (always gotta be the final challenge . . .). The wind from a nearby storm picked up against us and made the final three or four miles miserable. It blew me off the road and I hurt the palm of my hand pretty badly when I fell. It'll be a sore bruise - - added to the pain I already have in my hands. We ended up having to walk part of it. It was still incredibly tough to keep the bikes up, but perhaps a little less dangerous. Anyway, I'm going to sleep now.
"
202,"Crazy Mountain Inn Well, we surrendered to the wind at only 29 miles, but it was still a tough day. We didn't start out feeling strong, and then we had a strong headwind - - we were only making about 7 miles/hr average I think. We've usually been up around 11 or 12. Anyway, we figured out there was a hotel at Martinsdale and ahve fup on the idea of going to White Sulphur Springs today - - we cancelled our hotel reservations there. Only one problem - - we only had about $25 cash, and htere isn't an ATM or anyone who takes credit cards in town. The innkeeper, however, offered that we just mail her a check from the next town - - WOW. So that's the plan. :) It's pretty goofy of us. Cheryl (the innkeeper) and her son Miles were really friendly and helpful. I'd recommend this place highly! We're both still pretty tired - - had a hard time getting going today. We're really crabby on the road and have been since Wednesday. Hopefully we can catch up physically and get into a better mood!! Man, that riding into the wind is tough. Both of us have sore thighs this evening. It's the first real muscle soreness I've had on this trip. Doing OK otherwise - - my hadns have been a little sore but not numbing like last year. I've got a pretty sore bruise on the palm of my left hadn from falling in yesterday's wind. This hotel is very cute. Not terribly well remodeled or maintained, but very antique and cool. It is definitely early 20th C western, with one shared bath for the 16 rooms down the narrow wood-floored upstairs hallway. Very quaint and charming. :)  And has an excellent excellent cafe.       "
203,"Tenderfoot Highland Inn Today's ride took us up over the mountains and dropped us back into the beautiful valley of White Sulphur Springs. It was really a beautiful ride. Fairly tough though, even at only 37.5 miles - - the trip up the mountains kept our muscles working. The Inn we're staying at left us a little skeptical from the outside, but the rooms are really nice - - newly remodeled, clean, and white, with a little kitchenette where we made lunch and dinner. It was $40 for the night - - not too bad for as nice as it was.  Again not much to do in town. The library was closed on Sunday, so we made a stop at the grocery and the Town Pump and spent the rest of the afternoon relaxing. Went to bed early to get a little extra sleep. We sent off a money order to Cheryl back in Martinsdale. I'll have to give her a call in a couple of days to make sure she received it and we're paid up. That was so generous of her to let us pay her later!     "
204,"Roadrunner RV Park (VERY well kept) Another ride up and over the mountains today - - my thigh muscles are still a little bit sore. But it was a gorgeous ride. I really enjoyed it for the most part. I was pretty cold though. I still haven't figured out how to deal with cold weather. I end up sweaty and wet but still freezing cold on my fingers, face, and chest. I think I'm going to patent a neoprene ""tit-mit"" - - a sports bra of sorts with extra warmth in the chest. ;)  I have a hard time with my chest getting really cold, which really makes it ache. We are going to have to do some shopping in Helena for certain - - other than a few things for our bikes, we need better cold-weather clothing if we're planning on crossing the Canadian Rockies.  We plan to stay 2 or 3 days in Helena to get rested up and see if we can't get a little more go-power and thrill back into the ride. It's only another 30 or 40 miles down the road - - we should make it by lunchtime tomorrow.     "
205,"Motel 6 Well we made it to Helena finally! We got off to a late start because of this morning's rain and the wind was blowing strong against us for the first 12 miles or so. We had a reversal of our final-10-mile-troubles today, I guess. It got a lot better after those first 12 miles. :)  We ended up in a Motel 6 for the night at about $40. The room is white and clean -- I'm happy. :) The gel handlebar insert and Cinelli tape I ordered into Big Sky Cyclery weren't in today. The owner called and thinks the wrap will be in tomorrow but the inserts are on backorder. I'm really disappointed in them. I explained the situation to the guy on the phone, and told him we'd be through today. He promised they coud get it in. It really PO's me. And the shop guy and owner weren't particularly quick to help, nor were they at all apologetic. Dinner at a bar/grill downtown called The Windbag - - it was pretty good, but the Guinness was better (best beer around!).  ;)"

208,"Well we've rested for a few days in Helena. It was nice to take a real break. I feel like we got charged back up pretty well in the three days off. We didn't do anything terribly exciting . . . some shopping for warmer clothes and bike stuff. Dad and I both got a fancy windproofing fleece sort of jacket - - I think they'll be really warm. We made a stop at the Museum as well - - it was pretty interesting. Did you know that the grasshoppers of the Great Dustbowl Era would eat clothes hung out to dry, even tear down buildings that weren't watched?  Oie!!       The bike shop never did get the gel inserts I asked them to order . . . guess I'll just have to go without.     "
209,"Aspen Grove National Forest Campground We came over Flescher Pass today at just over 6100 feet. That marked the Continental Divide. :)   It was a pretty, pleasant ride - - really not too tough except the last three miles to the top of the pass. That was a steep, slow drag up the side of the mountain! But it was a blast!  Dad was more tired out than I at the end of the ride - - I thought it was pretty gentle overall. We ended up in an $8 campground about 9 miles east of Lincoln - - not a bad spot, but no showers. I improvised one though. I'd be hard put to go to sleep with a day's sweat and brine caked up on me! Not a pretty scent! I really enjoyed the terrain today though. Glad to be getting into the mountains where the land is a bit more exciting!           "
210,"Tammarack Resort Campground 13.0+ avg. speed Today's ride was really beautiful. IT was mostly downhilla nd went really fast! :)  I really enjoyed being able to check out the scenery today as we coasted along -- our average speed was over 13mph (we're usually pretty poky). The last 15 miles or so was on MT200, which was really busy and narrow with no shoulder. We had our fingers crossed against getting a boost from behind by some drunken boater catching us on his trailer on his way home from the lake. I guess the finger-crossing turned out, but we weren't feeling too confident as we pedaled along! Hopefully tommorrow's traffic will be lighter! The campground we ended up at is in a nice spot and well-equipped for fun, but they really don't have any tent spots. We're sort of sandwiched into the cabins. Ah well . . . the dip in the cool lake was worth it.  :) I'm really enjoying this touring. I hope I can keep going on - - I know Dad is a bit anxious to get back home in a couple of weeks here, but I'm really wanting to continue. I want to make it to Alaska! But aside from not having the finances to go on alone (we've been sharing funds and already spent quite a bit of mine), Dad and Mom will probably throw a fit and disown me before they let me ride on my own. I could have avoided the problem if I had started out on my own in the first place (what could they do?), but I'm kinda backed in now.I'm really enjoying Dad's company though - - don't get me wrong. It's great having him along!  I'm just frustrated with the idea of not finishing.  I'm having a blast!           "
211,"Swan Lake USFS Campground Another stunningly beautiful ride today through the Swan Valley. It cuts down through two mountain ranges that make a spectacular view on either side. Most of the road was a very gradual downhill today, except the first 14 miles or so to the summit. I was feeling pretty tired after our lunch stop at Condon though (they have a good little restaurant!). I'm ready to be off the bike for a few hours!! My muscles are pretty sore. We're debating on whether to go through Kalispell or Whitefish for tomorrow and a day's rest. From Whitefish, we'd have better access to Glacier if we want to go there, but Dad seems pretty stuck on Kalispell for some reason or another. Glacier has a lot of time restrictions on bicyclists - - we'd have to ride up really early in the morning then wait until evening to come back down. Plus, we'll be in the middle of heavy tourist season with the 4th of July approaching and all. Since we don't want to cross to the other side of the mountains again, we're debating as to whether or not we need to ride the park. We could take a bus up, or we could just save it for later . . . I'm pretty sure I'll be back to MT. I really am impressed with these mountains!!!   "
212,"Motel 6 What a beautiful area! We had another good ride today. Stopped for lunch at Dairy Queen in BigFork on the north side of Flathead Lake, and then headed into Kalispell where we found a bike shop and Dad had his front tire trued. He's been having problems with the bike wobbling and weaving when he puts a lot of weight on the front. Adjusting the hub hasn't worked, and neither has lightening the load in the front bags. Maybe it's the fork? My bike just feels steady and ""tight"" at higher speeds - - and I've got quite a bit more weight in my front panniers."
213,Motel 6 We rested for the day again today - - spent some time using the library computer and at an internet cafe downtown where I uploaded our photos. I don't know how to reduce the resolution and shrink my file size without the program I use at home - - what a pain!
214,"Silverado Motel We passed our 1000th mile this trip today!!  Hot dang!  (Ha, ha!!) Today's ride felt like it went pretty fast. We rode up to Whitefish on the Whitefish Stagecoach Road, which was a pleasant route, then stopped for a bite at McDonald's (about 18 miles out). After another 18 miles, we had a build-it-yourself lunch at the Olney Mercantile, then on to Eureka. This area seems to make all of its income by logging - - the trucks are passing every which way, and sawmills are scattered throughout. We stayed at the Silverado Motel - - its was a decent place, but the woman running it was really unfriendly and snotty. I don't recommend it!! We also stopped at a bike shop in Whitefish - - nice place, and the people were very helpful and friendly.       "
215,"West Crow Motel We're in Canada! Short ride today - - we got started late partly because Dad had another flat which he noticed right after finally getting everything packed up. After repairs and breakfast, we didn't get rolling until 11:30. We stopped at Elko just before 3. It looks like our town spacing is such that it doesn't really matter where we stopped today within the next 20 miles or so. The ride to Radium Hot Springs could have been two days from Eureka had we started earlier today, but I think we'll need three as is. It looks like a big climb out of Radium toward Banff . . . I think we'll want to start out there to be fresh for the climb. I was feeling kind of tired anyway, and really grumpy. I didn't really want to stop so early, but didn't want to ride either. One of those moments when you're just not quite happy with anything, ya know? Luckily I'm almost never like that! Ha! ;) My left hand has been sore and numbing up a bit again. The lady at the bike shop in Whitefush gave me some packing foam to put on my handlebar tops (the pipe-insulator type). I'm hoping it'll help a bit. It's just electrical-taped on right now, but oh well! I e-mailed Profile Design a few days ago to see if I could get replacement springs for my AeroBars, and got a response that they could send me a whole new set of armrests, but no springs (makes perfect sense, right?).  Watch out for the AirStrykes though - - they're great until the springs snap after less than a month's use!             "
216,"Skookumchuck Motel Still a beautiful day, of course - - that's getting to be the norm, eh? Nothing terribly eventful, though. We were actually aiming for the Springbrook Cabins, but didn't realize until heading out in the morning that we had stopped too early (we were right around the corner at the Skookumchuck). The prices (according to the manual) were half as much at the Springbrook. We were worn out and too eager to stop, I suppose!   "
217,"Mountain View Lodge We decided to stop in Invermere tonight so we'd have access to services for a day's rest before we start up into the mountains again. We checked out the hostel, but it felt pretty cluttered and dirtyish, so went ahead and paid for the motel - - it's really in a good spot, right downtown. Had dinner at Peppe's Italian Fuel Restaurant - - good food and good service!       "
218,Mountain View Lodge Nothing much to say . . . just relaxed today. Invermere is a pleasant town and a great location!
219,"Sinclair Pass - 1488m This was a fun ride! About 12 miles to the foot of the pass at Radium, then seven miles of uphill to the top! We ended up stopping for rain on our way back down the other side - - we stopped around 2 or 3 for a bite of food (self-cooked) at a campground shelter in order to escape the rain and hail, but the rain hadn't stopped by around 5, so we decided to stay the night. The campground host gave us unstated permission to stay in the kitchen structure in a closed loop of the campground. :) It was really an ideal place to camp on a rainy night - - Dad fired up the wood cook stove to warm the place up a bit, and we kept warm and dry from the rain. :)  Wish we had a shower though - - nothing like walking into a nice restaurant just totally reeking and grimy! Sometimes there's not much option though when you're hungry enough!           "
220,"Vermillion Pass-  1640m  (5380ft)  (this elevation seems to change by map) Today's ride wasn't so tough, but the weather was pretty crummy. It sort of drizzled off and on, leaving us on a constant struggle to keep dry, yet not too cold or too hot. We're really poorly equipped for rainy weather. It's just so expensive to get the stuff designed for touring in the rain. But it would be worth the investment after a couple of days of this! The pass we came over today wasn't so steep, but the summit marker wasn't actually at the top - - that's frustrating! It's just wrong to do that to a cyclist! We're staying at the Castle Mountain Hostel tonight - - it's a realy nice place. Super clean, comfortable, and very homey and spacey inside with very classy woodworking and furniture. Glad we stopped! There are also a lot of ""adults"" - - more than in the other hostels I've stayed at in Europe. It's probably good to help Dad feel more comfy. :)       "
221,"Bow Pass Another pass today - - a long, steady one this time. We rode the first 17 miles or so into Lake Louise with a guy named Chris who we'd run into at the hostel. It was a nice change to ride with someone else for a few miles. We split at the fork of 1 and 93, where we headed north on the Icefields Parkway. Wow. What amazingly beautiful country! I've been saying that since Helena, but it's just getting more and more beautiful and scenic! One more major pass tomorrow - - Sunwapta Pass. It's not so much higher than the others so far, but we keep hearing it's killer - - folks keep saying they won't even take their RV's on it. Should be a kick! I'm hoping I'll sleep well tonight - - I'll need the rest! Speaking of which, I'm gonna zonk!     "
222,"Sunwapta Pass Well today was exhausting! We were already really fatigued before we ever got started, and exhausted before the pass. It was a tough one! I usually really have a blast on the passes, but we're in need of a bit of rest. We may stay here another day, but at least we'll probably rest a few days in Jasper, which is about 50 miles further down the road. Today's ride was, of course, beautiful. I think I prefer the Banff ride, however - - yesterday's terrain will be pretty hard to match. The water on the Banff side is turquoise with a suspended powder from glacial runoff - - it's really beautiful. I think this water on the Jasper side would be too, except it picks up a bit of dirt on the way down and is rather brownish. The hostel we're in tonight is a ""rustic"" hostel, but the hosts have set up a makeshift shower which we really appreciated. I was really offending even myself on the way up the pass - - not smelling too sweet! Not good for a night in the dorms! I was really crabby on the way to the pass. Successful touring seems to be largely about attitude, but it's really difficult to have a good attitude when you're so tired. I'm not sure how far we'll get. Dad's been talking about throwing in the towel . . . needing a real break, I suppose. I'm hoping a few days in Jasper will help us recharge and improve our attitudes. I don't think we'll have enough time to reach Anchorage, but it would be nice to get to Whitehorse. From there, we could head down to Skagway and hop a ferry down to Juneau, the fly home.  I found out today that my Peace Corps invitation was sent out to my permanent address . . . I'm really excited! I tried to call my placement officer for more info., but no luck! :(    I'm really anxious to find out where and what and when!!!!!  I was really disappointed that I couldn't reach her. Didn't help with my grumpiness. Ah well, I'm beat . . . I think I'm going off to bed. There are a number of neat peaople here tonight, though - - a French couple and a few others I could practice my French with. I wish I were more energized!"
223,"TANZANIA!!!!!!!!!!!  I got my Peace Corps Invitation info. by e-mail today. I'm going to Tanzania in September to teach secondary-level mathematics! Apparently I'll really need to know Kiswahili to teach - - they'll teach us during the 2.5 mos. training. I'm planning to get some resources to start learning on my own though - - I really don't think 2.5 mos. will be enough for me! I also need to be seeking out teaching resources. I wish I knew what courses exactly I'll be teaching. It looks as if they really send you in as a full-fledged teacher though - - full schedule and all. Should be fun. I'm so excited! The news of my invitation really propelled me on our ride today. It wasn't too far, and we had a significant decrease in elevation. But we're both worn out - - I was happy to have the extra energy. We need a break. The campground we're in is huge - - feels like a camper factory. It's nice thoguh, and has a shower facility. It's a bit far from town - - we may move tomorrow so we can be somewhere better to rest. We're really wanting to stay off the bikes for a few days."
224,"Well we moved into the hostel today. The cheapest hotel in town was $145/night. We had a tough ride up the the hostel, but they have a shuttle to get us to town and back. It cost $3 one way, but is much better than having to ride! I really want to avoid tearing our muscles up again for a few days. Dad and I are still feeling completely trashed today. We didn't do much of anything, but had a hard time making it through dinner and waiting for the shuttle again to head back to the hostel. I think our fatigue from the past week or two of riding has really caught up to us. We'll really have to rest until we've re-energized and can handle the idea of biking again - - a few days at least! I got the replacement arms for my Aerobars at the bike shop here in town this evening. The folks at Profile Design shipped them in for me. I really appreciate their help! I don't think the springs are a good design, but I would recommend the company!"
225,Whistler's Hostel Another rest day today . . . nothing terribly exciting.
226,"Whistler's Campground Just resting again today. It looks like I'm kinda backed into a corner on this trip though. Along with my Peace Corps invitation came a bunch of paperwork, physical exam follow-ups, and other things I need to prepare a.s.a.p. And there's more on the way, apparently. I don't know if I can get those all done while I'm on the road in Canada. We're debating what to do next. I'm really enjoying this cycling. It's very therapeutic! But it looks like we won't have enough time to make it to Anchorage anyway - - Dad has to be back to teach by the end of August, and I'd also like to spend a bit of time at home with Mom and Lori (sis) before heading out for the next two and a half years. I guess we'll make a decision tomorrow as to whether we'll continue north, turn southward to work our way closer to home, or perhaps try to hop some public transportation back. I just can't let this cycling get in the way of the Peace Corps assignment, no matter how much fun I'm having, because it won't keep me fed for the next few years! But stuck back at the parents' place for the next two months when I was supposed to be cycling to Alaska won't be easy! And I'll be so anxious to head off to Tanzania - - I'd much rather be biking while I have to wait!"
227,Whistler Campground Another rest day . . . nothing too exciting.
228,"Twin Pine Motor Inn Well we finally decided this afternoon to turn southeast toward home. There really wasn't a good solution - - Dad was ready to head home. I could have kept on northward, but I don't think I would have had the time to make Anchorage anyway, and I would have had serious troubles completing my Peace Corps paperwork and stuff. I am really not ready to just quit though. I'm feeling like we've just gotten to the point where we're having a blast and know we can - - but still just at the end of the beginning. I'd still like to slim down - - no luck so far! Can't believe it! So anyway we chose a sort of middle ground - - ride toward home for a bit longer at least. I still will be delaying my Peace Corps obligations, which is probably unwise, but at least I'll not be completely abandoning the ride, and I'll have a little while to get used the the idea of not reaching Alaska. I'll finish it out someday, though!!!!!! The ride today was pleasand and beautiful - - mostly a steady downhill. This motel turned out the be pretty nice - - friendly staff and good cafe. :)"
229,"Twin Pine Motor Inn Reset Odometer Well today we got about 7.5 miles out when POP! Dad had a blowout. Afer replacing the tube and reinflating, we realized the sidewall had begun to rip where it met the edge of the rim. Not even two months of use on those tires!!  Specialized Infinity 700x35c. Avoid 'em!!!!!  Flat after flat, and then the sidewall rip out.He has't been riding them underinflated, either - - we've been pretty attentive. Anywa, we put a temporary boot on it ad headed back into Hinton, where we found no cycle chops and no 700 tires even at Walmart and Canadian Tire. So we ordered a tire out of a shop in Edmonton, which they sent by courrier on a Greyhound bus. That's the way to do it if you're ever stuck in nowhere, Canada! We knew we should've had a spare in the first place, but never found the right one. Glad to have Greyhound!"
230,"Sundowner Inn Well this ride turned out to be a bit hilly, with a little pass around 1100m. Good ride, though. Only one flat! Yup! - - on Dad's brand-new rear tire! Enough already! Knock-on-wood, but mine haven't had a flat yet this trip, and only one on our trip last summer! I'm getting to the point where I'd swear by these IRC Durotours that came stock on my Trek 520. Now I just need to figure out how to get more of them for spare and for Dad so we can actually get a few miles behind us between flats!! We had made reservations at the Summerland Inn for the night, but it was a pit - - we managed to get out of the reservation, then found the Sundowner. It was a little more pricey than we had hoped ($88 Canadian with tax), but it was really nice and had a great Continental breakfast! Ordered Chinese and stayed in all evening - - perfect!"
231,"Journeyman Inn No flats today! Wow! It was a drizzly day though - - that's no fun! We had a good lunch stop right about halfway, and then headed on into Entwistle. I love that name! I want to live in Entwistle! The terrain was pretty steady today, but afer being half-wet and half-cold all day, the rest and shower were great! We had a steak at the Lighthouse Restaurant next door - - good stuff!"

235,"        My original plan was to head to Prince Edward Island and do Nova Scotia, and see the place where I lived for a while when I was young. But, as you will see, I did not quite make it. Nonetheless, I made it into Bathurst, NB in 8 days, just under 1200 km.         I was mostly self-sufficient in the sense that I carried two days worth of food supplies, a small propane burner and fuel, and slept in my tent for most of the trip. My bike weighed in at a whoping forty pounds, and my equipment added another fifty pounds to the mix.          You will find my equipment list in the next pages. Some items that I wish I had brought are listed near the end. Remember that the tour started on May 1st, and that the equipment needed to stand up to the cold as well. I have also included my itinerary in the following pages.         Before this tour, my longest distance had been a 170km trip from Ottawa to Petawawa, so much experience and knowledge was gained from this trip. I will highlight these tips and tricks in my journal, and provide as much information as possible with regards to the route I followed, because I know from looking at other journals from this site that this can be usefull in preparation."

238,"Breakfast: French Baguette (stays fresh in ziploc bag), Peanut Butter, Instant Oatmeal, Dry Fruits, Hot Chocolate Lunch: Instant Chicken Noodle Soup, Dried Pepperony Sticks, Fruit Cups Diner : Rice, Canned Stew, Hot Chocolate, French Baguette, Fruit Cups I bought fresh cheese and fruit along the way. I carried a can of Gatorade powder and made it as I went along. The 2 liter hydration poutch carried enough water to make dinner and breakfast and to clean myself and the dishes. In the daytime, I would refill my water bottle from the hydration pack when I stopped for a break.  Canned foods are very heavy and not recommended. I only brought them because of my small budget. I recommend freeze dried foods that are very light but a bit more expensive. With the one burner stove, at the end of a long day, you want something quick that can be done simply by adding a pouch to water and cooking it. Take care to wrap all foodstufs in ziploc bags as to not attract wildlife to your tent. I always carried ""extra"" snacks in case I needed a power boost. Personally, I prefer the chewy Vector Energy Bars than Powerbars, and also enjoy the Fruit to Go bars."
239,"            My bike was very loaded, a lot more than in my supposedly fully loaded trial the week before. It was probably the extra food I had packed. I had hardly left Ottawa, and I was convinced I had a flat. The bridge to cross into Québec (Pont Alexandra) has a pedestrian walkway made of wooden planks and has thousands of nail heads sticking out at unsuspecting tires  But finally I was fine, and got underway.         The decision to cross into Quebec directly at Ottawa rather than in Hawkesbury or Cornwall was motivated by Quebec's 'Route Verte'. This is a 3000km network of roads and trains with large paved shoulders! The only section of the route without paved shoulder in Thurso.             I had lunch in a small canteen in Fasset, and took the 344 after the Hawkesbury bridge to follow the Ottawa River. I find that it is more pleasant to follow a body of water when riding long distances. It helps with the orientation, gives you something to look at, and there is usually communities at short intervals. The 344 is very quiet, definitely a secondary route. The road surface is pretty banged up, but I had a lane to myself for a good 60-70km.         The Ottawa River is quite wide at that point and a HUGE damn crosses it at Carillion. The only big hill for the day is a steep grade up right after the town of Carillion.            I arrived in St-Placide near the end of the day and stopped to ask a man working on his fence how far it was to Oka, my planned destination. I thought I had about 20 km to go, but he said it was only 5km, so I asked him if I could camp in his yard. Turns out he had an isolated camping spot right on the river, complete with picnic table and dock! So I setup camp, cooked dinner, and looked at a beautiful sunset over the river."
240,"        I did not know at the time, but there are political tensions at the Kanetasake Mohawk reserve in Oka, and the 344 splits the reserve in half. So if you plan to use this route, I recommend to have planned an alternate in cased the road is closed. I must admit however that it is an ideal route to follow to enter Montreal. I made sure not to stop on reserve land, and saw a few warriors in their apparel, and had to cross a small police road block before the reserve.          I met my dad in Rosemère, just north of Montreal, and he guided me though Montreal on a circuit of paved and unpaved trails. He had done them before and was relatively familiar with the street layout, so we crossed Montreal in good time. He left me at the Jacques Cartier Bridge, which is well accessible to pedestrians and cyclists via a sidewalk separated from the main roadway. I used the right side of the bridge (I think you can access both sides) and took a bike only exit down to street level on the other side. It all looks very confusing because it is a series of viaducts and streets on different levels crossing each other, but I found that once I had gotten on a regular boulevard, it was easy to orient myself.            Crossing Montreal was actually a lot easier than expected, and there were some beautiful views. All you have to do is make certain you are heading south. When you hit water, find a bridge!            We had rain all day today, with a warm clearing near the end of the day. I stayed with my uncle and aunt in Boucherville and had a nice warm shower, a hot meal, and a bed!"
241,"        I was offered a place to stay in Nicolet, but I was having lunch and decided to go on. I was already ahead of my planned route. Another migratory bird refuge near Nicolet posted yellow road signs warning of birds on the road! There was actually a blanket of white geese in the fields!             There is a confusing section of highway near Gentilly and the Gentilly nuclear cenral. The 132 becomes the 20 for a while and it is forbidden for bikes to ride a major highway with posted speeds of more than 100 km/h. I braved the first section on a large full-lane paved shoulder, but met-up with another cyclist who was president of local bike club. He showed me that the road parallel to the highway, even though it was marked a dead-end, was in fact a cyclist-reserved road that bypassed the highway section.         By now my legs are used to the daily torture inflicted upon them, and I am beginning to break my butt in (not my seat though). I must say I am very satisfied with my Terry Liberator saddle.         It is pleasant to be able to converse in French, and I get a slight impression of cultural differences between here and Ottawa. I am beginning to feel like I am getting somewhere.          I believe that I have mastered the technique for finding a nice, free camping spot. I stop at the nicest house I can find, with the nicest view of the St-Laurence, and tell the owners that I am biking from Ottawa to Halifax, and from where I left that morning. That is enough to get them into awe, and while the effects of this last, I ask for permission to put my tent in the backyard. Still in awe, they escort me to the back, and we chat about my trip so far. You have to make sure the details are interesting enough that they want to know more (or begin to catch cold) and they eventually invite you in for the night. That night I had a shower, bed and the lady even made my a breakfast with some homemade cretons!          The folks I stayed with had hosted another cyclist some twenty years earlier that had cycled the world starting in France the into Africa, Asia, South America. His trip was coming to an end as he was heading for Halifax to return home to his wife he had not seen in three years! All this to say there are some very hospitable people in that region of the Lower St-Laurence and Gaspésie.   "
242,"        I felt that my bike was beginning to handle a bit differently so I stopped to check things out, and find a flat on my rear tire just as I was coming in to Lotbinière. I unloaded my bike (in the snow) and changed the tube (in the snow). It was getting pretty cold, even with my two jerseys, shorts and slicks, arm warmers, headband, thermal gloves and jacket. I found my gear appropriate for riding, but a little cold for sleeping and off-bike activities.          I stop in St-Croix for the biggest poutine I have ever seen (I couldn't finish it!). With the Quebec City Bridge in sight, I get my second flat of the day. There was probably a object lodged in my tire  I was staying with friends of friend of friends just a little ways away from the 132. I patched my tubes when I arrived. When I inspected my bike, I noticed that the back wheel was moving from side to side. I took the bike in to the shop (which stayed open half and hour late to wait for me and my bike) and the guy tightened my cones and tuned up my front derailleur. It cost 5$. Turns out my wheels were way under inflated (by about 30 psi!) So he pumped them up to the upper limit. The ride was improved drastically, and I gained about 5 km/h!         I am warned that the hills start tomorrow, after Montmagny!
"
243,"        I followed the cycling path suggested by the 'Route Verte' maps which is follows the St-Laurence river right through Lévis starting at the Quebec City Bridge. It offers as close a view possible of Old Québec City and the port installations as possible without actually being on the north shore.               Rain at midday as I was comming through St-Jean-Port-Joli. This was one of the nicest town on the hole trip. It is filled to the brim with sculpors and artisans with hundreds of shops selling arts and crafts. I eat lunch at Tim Hortons in Montmagny (they are my unofficial sponsor!). I find it necessery to get a nice warm meal with soup and hot chocolate, and these restaurants are mostly guaranteed to have an electric hand dryer, so every lunch I would basically take my close off in the washroom and dry everything down to my boots. In cooler weather such as this, it is crucial to remain dry (including feet).             The town of Kamouraska offers one of the most beautiful landscapes of this trip, with old restored historical homes, and for the first time, the smell of seawead and maritime air fills my nostrils.         The mountains to the North are spectacular and magestic, even from a distance, and some are still snow capped. This is one of the advantages of taking the 132 as opposed to travelling on the north shore. First, the road is apperantly better, second the sun sets on the St-Laurence and makes for some nice pictures, and lastly, it is easier to cross the bridge in montreal rather than taking a ferry. I say this because the bridges in Trois-Rivières and Quebec City are closed to pedestrians.         In this sector, the 132 is very quiet, but an old lady nearly ran me over with her car in St-Denis. I was crossing a T intersection at good speed, and she underestimated my speed and cut me off to turn on the right. She came within one foot of my bike. Some kids comming home from school shouted insults to her on my behalf.         So far the hills are nothing worst than my training runs in the Gatineau Park. I noticed a public phone when I rode in to St-André and decided to call home from there. It was in front of an old school house. I asked a passerby if it would be alright for me to camp there. The lady told me it belonged to a certain foundation. It seemed like a good spot to camp, so I setup camp out of sight, next to the St-Laurence.   "
244,"        The road after Rivière-du-Loup is very boring and uninteresting. Fields, no view of the St-Laurence, no mountains. The shoulder is non-existant, and there are my tractor trailers as this is the main access route to New-Brunswick and Gaspésie.         After Trois-Pistoles, the terrain becomes more hilly, and you come across a very nice strech of land with the Bic National Park. You get a taste of the Appalachians with steep slopes covered in connifourous trees.            It was very cold comming in to Rimouski (apparently it is always a few degrees cooler there than in surrounding regions) so I took a hot chocolate there. When I got close to St-Flavie, I really wanted to try and get offered a room, because I was cold, some of my equipment was wet, and it was beginning to rain. I tried about five places without luck. The tourism office for the Gaspésie region is in St-Flavie, so I stopped to ask about b&b's and hotels.          Finally, I rode in to the Rita motel, wet and miserable. I paid 40$ for the room, brough my bike in and cleaned it well, layed out my things to dry, and cleaned myself well before laying down to dry... Anyhow, I should have planned for a motel about halfway. This place is highly recommended. The rooms are clean and newly renovated. The Weather Network is forcasting sun well into next week and warmer temperatures."
245,"           About 30km outside of Mont-Joli, I begin to cool down and stop to put my jacket on. To my great suprise, it had vanished from the stuffsack it was in. I remembered packing it at the motel, so I figured it had fallen off. Give the cold temperatures and run-ins with snow, this was a crucial, essential piece of equipment. I shouted a few swears, collected myself and waited for a while. About five minutes later, a pickup stopped to tell me that someone had picked up my jacket and was comming with it. Of course that generous someone had decided to keep the coat, and I never saw it again.             My budget being quite limited for the trip, I thought that I should stop in Amqui and head home (a good jacket in these small towns is around 100-150$!). I had snow as I was entering Amqui (to discourage me from continuing). I had lunch, and called the train station, who told me I could not get on there with my bike. So I was forced to continue, and bought a very overpriced (but nice) rain jacket at a small sport store on the 132.          The Matapédia valley is one of the most scenic spots on the trip. I would defenitely check all my equipment before entring, because it is nearly unhabited for a good 60km. The road is mostly parrallel to the Matapedia river, sometimes cut in the rock facade. The road is downhill for almost 30km (sufficiently so not to pedal) and the entire landscape seems to be sucked verticallyy down to a distant point on the horizon. The river runs at a very steap angle. Very strange. I realize today that my camera battery is going, and without it, I cannot take pictures. I have to bring a spare on my next trip. At last, I cross the unofficial bridge in to New Brunswick. I will tell you where I sleep in tommorow's entry..   "
246,"           There are a lot of hills comming out of Tide Head. The hills in Dalhousie are the steepest I have ever seen a town on. They call it Little San Fransico. I had to get off the bike and push for the only time in the tour. In DOWNTOWN Dalhousie.          The Restigoushe River estuary is quite splendid, with the mountanous landscape of Gaspésie in the background. The water actually looks a little turquoise in comparison to the St-Laurence. Strangely, after Dalhousie, the 11 follows a very narrow causeway between the Bay des Chaleurs and some other lake-like body of water. The wind was atrocious, and I was crawling at a crippling 5 km/h for a good kilometer and a half, pushed over opposite to the wind at a very acute angle! I thought I might have to walk that section.          Be forewarned that when you pass that causeway, you are entering the heart of Accadia! French is my maternal language, and I could not understand a word of french that the convenience store clerk spoke, and nor could she. 'Combien loin pour Bathurst?' - '????????' she answered... And they stared at each other realizing that it was beyond their power... Sorry!            I must say that the 11 is quite nice. A sign near Tide Head explicitly forbids trucks (besides pickups) to use the highway.          This had been the first real day of sunshine since day 1, but there was still a strong crosswind from the west."
247,"        I decide I better stop before I ruin the trip by comming home completely exhausted and discouraged. I was well ahead of schedule, had done two back to back centuries for a total of 4 in the trip, and had averaged well above 20 km/h. I was proud to have reached the 1200km mark. And to me this was an accomplishment rather than a failure. I had not quit, simply stopped.          So I waited at the train station for a few hours, packed my bike in the hugest bok I have ever seen. All you have to do is remove the pedals (so make sure you carry a pedal tool if you want to travel by train) and turn the handle bars sideways. There is a registered luggage fee of 15$. The train ride (tough moslty in the night) offers spectacular views of the route I just followed, the Matapédia, Gaspésie, Montreal... The ticket from Bathurst to Ottawa for a student was only 110$ in a economy seat. I felt that the train was best over the plane because I could hop on at any of the 15 or so stations on my route, and my route followed almost directly the train line.         And thirteen hours later, I was in Ottawa, hugging my girlfriend for the first time in a very long week..."
248,"        The next tour is planned for june or july 2004 and will finish the Atlantic leg from Bathurst, NB to Saint John's, NL. I plan to visit PEI, the Cabot Trail, and take the ferry to Port-aux-Basques for a long ride in Newfoundland. I find the ferry to Argentia makes it to easy to get to the final destination. That tour should take about two weeks, and I hope I can complete with my recently acquired knowledge. The following tour (we all plan ahead right?) should be three weeks from BC to Ottawa. I think you see where i'm going with this. Coast to Coast. Maybey after that I can do it all over again in one shot!         I hope you have enjoyed my account of this short trip. Please, do not hesitate to communicate with me for more details. Also, I am looking to purchase a new touring road bike in the 1000-2000$ CAD range. If you have any recommendations, please write in my guestbook.          Be advised that the pictures from the trip have yet to be scanned, but you can expect about 30-40 pictures in about a week."

250,"Following the trail around the western end of the lake we were able to enjoy the light change on the water as the day progressed. A couple hours of easy riding brought us into Grimsby where we took a break at a local store and bought some refreshment we rely on a lot in warm weather...popsicles. Two more hours of riding and we were into Port Dalhousie. A great place to stop for lunch as this is part of the old Welland Canal and has many attractions. The trail now follows the shore to the present Welland Canal where we were lucky enough to see a large ship locking through. The trail east of here has a couple miles of nasty road... narrow, lots of traffic and a poor shoulder. Waiting until the road bridge went up to let the ship pass we took off and flew along the empty road. The ride into Niagara On The Lake passes through orchards and vineyards then into a very pretty town. We  picked up The Niagara Parkway Trail and rode a short distance south to Shalamar Lake Campground which is just off the trail."
251,"Since I had not been able to get a definite answer on the condition of the Erie Canalway Trail west of Lockport we decided to intercept it closer to its western end. We rode out of Niagara Falls on hwy. 62, which had a good paved shoulder but also the detritus of a busy city. It wasn't long before we were rural and after some local advice we came across our goal. Obviously unridable. Not yet. Good roads got us into Lockpot which is very interesting as the present trail terminus. The engineering of the locks is quite impressive as they are cut through the stone. As we rode the trail we wondered where all the people were. The trail was ours alone, almost. A couple hours of pleasant riding brought us into Middleport where the bridge attendant, who was putting finishing touches on a bridge paint job, directed us to a spot on the other side of the canal. We found a grassy area to set up our tent and showers and toilets. All this is because of the boaters but may be used by cyclists and hikers. Because of the wet spring and high water levels boat traffic was light and no one shared our park. After setting up and having supper we spent some time with the bridge attendant who was a wealth of information.
"
252,"Somewhere along here I got a flat. Since I always carry a spare tube it was only a few minutes before we got going again. I have bad luck patching tubes so started looking for a store that had 700mm tubes. Had to settle for 27in. at about the third town along. Because we had been warned of the condition of the trail surface near Rochester we were not surprised by all the speed bumps. We slowed right down and slalomed along for a couple of miles Getting through some tricky parts where the Genessee River crosses the canal was made easier with the arrows painted on the trail. A little bit of attention got us through the parks along our route. A lot of commuters were on the trail heading to their homes in the suburbs. One of them stopped and chatted for a bit. He was helpful with local info and was looking forward to taking part in the mass ride of the canal which takes place in mid July. He and his wife had their registration numbers as there was a cutoff at something like 500 riders. Must be a sight to see as we had only seen a handful of riders until Rochester. The lock at Pittsford, east of Rochester looked like a good place to spend the night. It was busy with people out for rides and walks but would quieten down at dark when the gates would be closed. We shared the grounds with a young fellow from Boston who was loaded up and on his way to Oregon."
253,"At Palmyra we had to leave the towpath and ride Hwy 31. It had a good shoulder but it also had rolling hills. Not too bad but we had become spoiled after the flat towpath. Also it started to rain. As we were leaving town it started to come down pretty heavily. so we headed for a welcome sign, ""BAR"". We grabbed a couple of stools at the side and ordered some bar food. Regulars were coming and going, some of them didn't even need to order which seemed to be a good sign. The owner was very nice and taking pity on us told us we were welcome to stay as long as we liked. He had some stories to tell and when we asked him about Palmyra being the birthplace of the Mormon religion he told us about the yearly pageant that draws thousands but doesn't do much for his business. As the rain tapered off we carried on, arriving in the sleepy community of Clyde without a room to be had. Our map showed Lock 26 to be a couple of miles off the highway so we headed there knowing we could at least camp. The lock attendant was surprised to see us roll in. The grounds were well kept, as they all had been and we felt quite comfortable in spite of the lingering showers. It was extremely quiet with not a boat in sight, nor would there be, and no other people. Even the fish were acting strange. Dozens, maybe hundreds of carp were swimming at the surface gulping as though they were trying to breathe. We had weird dreams that night."
254,"The ride along Hwy 31 continued to be safe and easy. We were able to shop for groceries in Weedsport and, unable to find a park, had our lunch on a grassy bank along the road. We took another break in Baldwinsville which is a pretty town with a busy waterfront. We were able to take advantage of their facilities and had much appreciated showers. We had intended to make it to Oswego but since the wind was bothering us and the traffic was getting heavy we checked out the locks in Fulton. They were in a busy area at the back of a restaurant and as we were deciding whether to push on or not a local lady came along and told us of a nearby campground.  The campground was a nice surprise, not fancy but suitable. Most of the people seemed to be seasonal as we were the only transients."
255,"We decided to move our tent around the corner of the hill that was behind us and found some shelter. About mid morning two other cyclists came in. They were going with the wind at their backs but were not enjoying it. The one fellow was on a recumbent with a windscreen that was acting, as he said, like a spinnaker. As we compared notes we learned that they were part of an active cycling group from Royal Oak, Mi. and were on their way to Bar Harbor where they were to meet their wives for a holiday.  After twiddling our thumbs for too long we headed the short distance into town. We cycled most of it and were glad not to be out on the road. Picked up some easy fixings for dinner and went back to our camp and played scrabble. Still blowing when we went to bed."
256,"The road turned inland a bit and became moderately hilly. The fast glide down helped us part way up the next hill. In a few cases we were glad to get off and excercise different muscles by walking. Our next view of the lake was Sodus Bay and as we entered Sodus Point we decided to look for a campsite. We found a nice campground on a bluff on the west end of town. After setting up we rode back into town to look around and enjoy.  As it was Sunday the campground pretty well emptied as the weekend people went home.
"
257,"Left the orchards and entered the domain of the large showy home.We were getting close to Rochester and following Seaway Trail signs. After we crossed the narrow end of Irondequoit Bay there were no more signs. We kept on in what we hoped was the right direction. Asking for direction only added to our confusion. We were getting closer to the downtown skyline which is the wrong way as that is too far inland. We went for it and got involved in a Harley Owners get together. A strolling information officer directed us to the nearby tourist bureau where the young fellow at the desk was a knowledgable cyclist. Apparently the trail signs do not last long in the city. So, armed with maps and info we headed back to the lake. We met it at the mouth of the Genessee River where the Fast Ferry was loading for a trip to Toronto. If we got aboard we could be home that evening.  We had better things to do and got on with them. The trail, a lot of which is parkway without commercial vehicles, was very lightly travelled. The wind was a bit wearying but we kept at it and arrived at Hamlin Beach State Park, an older park in very good condition. Out of over 200 campsites only 20 were occupied. The grounds are very nice with lots of picnic area and hiking trails. The beach was vast and empty. After a supper of wild salmon with rice and brocolli we had showers and went to bed extremely satisfied."
258,Finally on our way at 10:30 and the first thing we saw as we got back on the parkway was a deer. We looked at each other for awhile before he decided to head for the trees. The road changed to two lane but still plenty wide. Entering Oak Orchard we spotted a nice looking local restaurant that seemed to be busy. Couldn't pass that up so we went in and had the daily special. Home made chicken 'n' biscuits. My mouth waters from the memory. Back on the road into a headwind and lowering skies. Lucky not to get rained on. Decided not to press our luck so stopped early at Golden Hills State Park. It is small but very nice with a unique lighthouse that has been restored with the help of volunteers and the Friends of 30 Mile Lighthouse. There are not any other square lighthouses that I know of.
259,"Met the Niagara River at Youngstwn and stopped for a while. Carried on to Lewiston along the river, which is not designated as the Seaway Trail but was taking us where we wanted to go. Had an early supper then went to tackle a hill we had been dreading for the whole trip. We got into bottom gear, put our heads down and kept pumping until we got to the top and were rewarded with a fantastic view of the lake and the countryside.  It was only a short distance to the Queenston - Lewiston Bridge but turned into the most dangerous part of the trip as we negotiated the ramps and dodged the exits. Riding across the bridge and through customs was easy in comparison. The toll collector (.50 each) showed us how to get out of there and on to the Niagara Parkway where we had a thrilling ride down to the campground we had left the previous week. We ended up on the same site near the group camping area which was occupied by a bunch of riders from.... Royal Oak, Mi. We were able to tell them about meeting their friends which they enjoyed. They were at the end of a trip along the north shore of Lake Erie and were being met by their spouses - partners who were going to join them for a couple days sightseeing before driving home. We were particularly interested to meet two blind lady riders that were cycling with them. They both had marvellous attitudes and were so upbeat they must be a joy to travel with."
260,"The Welland Canal is one of our favourite areas. Just south of where we met it are the step locks which are well set up for viewing with an observation platform that lets you talk with the pilot or crew on the bridge of a ship being locked through. When we got near the lake we got back on the Waterfront Trail and headed west, retracing our route of not that long ago. Except this time the wind was in our faces. We stopped at Jordan Harbour for a lunch of hot soup. The last of our food and as it turned out the last of our fuel but the soup (Ramen noodles) was edible and appreciated. A couple hours of energy sapping pedalling got us into Grimsby where we stretched out in a nice park and fell sound asleep. We were awakened by a drop in the temperature and the arrival of dark clouds. Fortunately they didn't cause us any grief  so we put the bone in our teeth and kept on pushing. Felt so good to roll into our driveway just after 5:00."

266,"Susan returns today from ten days in Paris, and will while away the remaining weeks with trips to Hudson, New York (family), the Aspen Music Festival, the Santa Fe Opera, and will spend some time in Chicago before returning home in August.  (Oh yeah, I'll do another week of cycling in Wisconsin before I get home.) The actual cycling today was a pleasant 61 miles of gently rolling terrain.  It was a bit of respite, after an easy 50 on day 1, a more formidable 110 (more on that to follow) on day 2, and 90 and 80 on days 3 and 4.  We started in Alton, IL, and made overnight stops in St. Charles MO, Jefferson City, and Marshall. Day 2, then, shouldn't have been such a big deal.  More than half the distance was programmed for the Katy Trail, a compacted crushed limestone former railbed.  A savvy veteran of two US crossings and heaven knows how many other adventures with only a cue sheet and a xeroxed map for guidance could not screw up the start of a day this badly.  Well, I went about 9 miles along this Katy Trail, and came to a crossroads in the trail where there were no signs.  Which way was the desired continuation for me was genuinely unclear, because I had just completed some elaborate curlicues approaching and leaving a bridge over the Missouri, and passing under an on-ramp to a superhighway.  Anyway, I picked a path, and stopped the first people I met to find out which was the way west on the Katy Trail.  These folks were sure I had headed east, toward St. Louis, when I left St. Charles.  That was astounding, but not unbelievable; I hadn't been looking at the sun, and there were no signs anywhere on the trail.  So I turned around and again stopped the first person encountered and was assured that I was now headed west, the way I needed to go.  I had not, in fact, gone the wrong way from St. Charles, and as I proceeded back there, again through twists and turns, it became pretty clear, through the position of the sun, that this was the case. So there I was, within a mile or two of back where I started from, on a day when we had all gotten an early start on a long day, having spotted everyone an 18-mile head start.  I had no appetite for returning up the trail to figure out the right path at the crossroads, so I headed for Highway 94, which is the Lewis & Clark Trail for cars.  There would be constant reminders I was headed west, and on the right road, and I had a map besides.  Then I got a blowout, requiring a big patch on the inside of my rear tire, to prevent the new tube from doing the same thing.  I could be in some real trouble now, with the support believing I'm somewhere on the trail, or far ahead, if I had another flat or blowout that couldn't be fixed with a patch. OK, nothing else bad happened.  Traffic on Highway 94 wasn't too bad, there were a lot more hills and about 4 more miles than the trail route, but I kept myself hydrated and fed, and moving along.  When I finally met up with the staff, they were surprised to see me, having assumed I was way ahead.  I was doing well, and gave an ETA of 8 PM for my 133-mile day.  Well, they came back at 7 PM and snatched me off the road with 12 miles to go.  'Dad, I tolja I'd be in before 8, whya pickin' me up now?'  'Get in the car, Son.'  'Aww, OK; don't let my friends see me.' Let's see, 121 miles on a 110-mile day.  I'm still good for the EFI Club, right?  No, I did not complete the route, point-to-point.  Them are the rules.  Maybe EFI with an asterisk?  Oh, well    "
267,"I thought about that, and I said, 'No, when I'm home I'm on vacation.  This is my job.' The rain pretty much stopped before we got going, so it wasn't much of an issue.  60 miles.
"
268,"Later on, I rode some with Sig and Dan, who go at a speed I can usually handle.  If they get the least bit ahead, though, it's often impossible for me to close the gap.
"
269,
270,"Today, however, Georg held back to ride with Tom and Carla.  This was Carla's first day back on the bike after a tumble and scrape from a groove in the road a few days ago.  I was having a good day, and mostly by avoiding any prolonged food or water stops, I discovered halfway through the day's 61 miles, that I was well ahead of the main group, second only to Tony.  This was unprecedented;  I'm a middle-of the-pack guy.  I was motivated, kept up a reasonably good pace, and continued  to minimize stop times.  When the nasty headwind came up for the last 15 miles, I gritted my teeth, got my head down, and pressed on, and arrived at the motel at 12:30.  Tony, as expected, had been in the hot tub for an hour.  I'll get better as the adventure continues, I expect, but so will everyone else.  This was a moment of glory.
"
271,"A stiff, 15-mile an hour headwind developed early, and strengthened and gusted as the day progressed.  I rode again with Sig and Dan from the monument.  We are pretty well-matched, and we made good time while the wind was moderate.  Later on, we were overtaken by Tom, who had thought Carla and some others were in front of him (they had left a bike-trail segment too early).  It was clear about then that we needed to do some serious organizing of a paceline.  I tend to be a little controlling in this process, even though I am quick to point out I am no expert.  My excuse is that a paceline of unfamiliars is a dangerous business. 'Casual paceline-riding is like casual unprotected sex; you can die from it,' I intone. But safety isn't always the point of my directions.  Oh well, that's the way I am.  Tom and Sig had done a lot of this before.  Dan said he was a rookie, but it didn't show.  Bottom line:  we did a more than passable job of organized drafting, and got done quickly and without the total exhaustion we would have faced alone.  There will be more such days.         "
272,"Couldn't ride with Sig and Dan, either.  ' I am so weak with this diarrhea, I cannot ride in a paceline,' says Sig, 68.  According to Dan, Sig sets the pace.  I could not reel them in.
"
273,"This is my first time in South Dakota by any means of travel.  The land rises and falls in long, gentle strides, three or five miles at a time, often.  We are told we are headed where grazing land predominates, but here there is still much cultivation of row crops.  The river is smaller (and clearer) now, of course, but we haven't had many chances to observe that.  We have seen at least two lakes created by Missouri River dams.     "
274,"I was a little late for breakfast, and got served last.  Everyone but Tony was on the road before I finished my oatmeal.  I rode alone all day, but did not suffer.   We visited the Akta Lakota Museum (very worthwhile).  It was my turn to buy the dinner wine - the regular wine drinkers are the Chicago boys, Bruce and Axel, Tom, Dan, and me - but the restaurant offered none.  Our waitress could not reach her boss, who might have forbidden our bringing it in from the liquor store, so, naturally, I did. I left my rain jacket hanging in the room at the Hillcrest in Burke.  Neither the Hillcrest nor Burke seem like much of a place, to us (mostly) big-city sophisticates.  Management - I don't know who - got that jacket, jumped in a car, drove 30 miles to catch Dick, who stuffed it in a pannier, and asked whose it was at a rest and replenishment stop further along.  Those are good people.  I've left stuff in motel rooms on bike rides before, and this has never happened.  Then I discovered the room key in my jeans, in Chamberlain.  Not a magnetic strip on plastic, but a real key, with a 'drop-in-any-mailbox' tag on it.  I returned that, but I've got to send a thank-you note, too. Tomorrow we have 95 miles to go, so breakfast will be at 6 AM, so we can get as much as possible done before the wind comes up.  The weather report indicates a tailwind.  We'll see whether that turns out.   "
275,"The terrain is different.  We're beyond the 100th meridian, and row crops are seldom seen, a lot of them under irrigation.  Grazing land is more the rule. Our focus is on getting in to Pierre, to have a day off the bike, sleep two nights in the same place.   "
276,"Today, I am greatly helped by a high-speed internet connection.  I stopped at a Radio Shack in Chamberlain, and bought a PCMCIA ethernet card, which worked without a hitch of any kind. At dinner tonight, I will hear about boat rides on the lake, excursions to the mall and whatnot.
"
277,"I rode the first 60 miles without putting a foot down, ate a quick lunch off the van, and only stopped every 20 miles after that.  A long day needed to be cranked, as best I could.  I passed and got passed, and never fell into a pace with anyone. Carol is back.  She left about a week ago to lead a Timberline hiking tour.  She'll disappear again for a time, later.       "
278,"This was a short day, sixty miles with good weather.  I could not repeat that sixty miles without putting a foot down trick.  I need relief from the compression of the balls of my feet.  Yesterday was the day after an off-day.  Oh, did I forget to mention the tailwind?  I always want to credit my conditioning, my stamina, the good, big breakfast.  To paraphrase, it was the wind, stupid - for more than the first half of the day.  Then it petered out (or I did). I had lunch with Georg in the casino, and broke even at gambling.  Put no money in, got no money out.  I thought about taking a depressing picture of the rows of (mostly) seniors endlessly working the slots, but that would be just one more indignity for those folks.  Instead, I offer a posed one of me.  No grocery fund was damaged in the making of this picture.  'The more you play, the more you lose,' programmed absolute truth. A casino promises a better dinner, however.  Okay, the menu features are a little hokey, and dated:  mise-en-scene Steak Diane, and Bananas Foster, but they're good; everything else was, too, and well-served. Sig leaves us tomorrow.  Carla composed a poem, which I hope appears on their website.  We toasted him and sang the bloody song: Why was he born so beautiful, Why was he born at all? He's no bloody use to anyone; He's no bloody use at all.     "
279,"Rode with Tony for a short while today.  Grabbed his back wheel, and held on for dear life.  I did my Jose Jimenez bit:  'Hey, back here it is easy.  It's just like being on unemployment.  You don't have to work, you show up on Friday, they give you a check anyway.'  Maybe it's time to retire that routine.  Tony is a guy, when he's pulling, and he comes to a little rise, he doesn't slow down, he doesn't downshift, he just pushes harder.  Then he comes to not such a little rise, and he does the same thing.  I hung on three, maybe four miles.  Adios.  (Yeah, I know he was deliberately trying to drop me.  I've done that, too.) The bike trail took us past a reconstruction of a Mandan village that was abandoned before Lewis and Clark came through - its people were decimated by smallpox brought to them by the white man - and a spot on the river where the Corps of Discovery camped on both the outgoing and return trips (on opposite shores).  It's amazing that such a place exists, given all the dams and resultant lakes, and the river's propensity to wander, but that what the plaque says. Some personal stuff.  On Sunday I learned that David (my eldest son) and Atena are expecting their first child in February.  Today I was informed that my Uncle Chester, 91, died last night.  He was very much a part of my growing-up years, and family events ever since.  I will not reach for cliches about births and deaths, but this is a lot to take in, in a short time. And then at dinner we have Tom and Carla celebrating the birth of their first grandchild.  See http'//www.crazyguyonabike.com/doc/lewisandclark2004 for that.  The restaurant exhausted its three-bottle stash of Freixenet, and brought out some pseudospumante, without checking with Tom.  A misunderstanding cleared up by a deletion from the bill.  We are headed for some dark days on the dinner wine front, it is now clear.         "
280,"We have been traveling more north than west since pretty early in the trip, and for the past week or so, we have been skirting the western border of the Central Time Zone.  We've been in and out of Mountain Time several times, but haven't had an overnight on Mountain Time.  In fact, we will not do so until July 4, in Culbertson, Montana.  Pick City, which is ambivalent on which zone to embrace, led to the following absurdity:  Dazey Duke's, a bar, night spot, road house, as much as a restaurant, chooses to be on Mountain Time, to maximize the late drinking hours.  So tomorrow morning we get up at 6:00, load luggage at 6:45, go across the street for breakfast at 6:00, and come back to the motel to depart at maybe 7:30.  The final change in time will be welcome, as most of us have been going to bed in broad daylight, at 9:00 or 9:30 PM. Speaking of traveling north, here's a general note on the weather and the wind.  It's been somewhat unusually cool over most of the area we've traversed in the past few weeks.  That's caused - in part, at least - by an unusual preponderance of a northerly wind component.  Now, taking this trip east to west, we certainly expected some headwinds.  But the segments headed north should have had some help from southerly winds, at least more often than the opposite.  We had bad luck when the odds were in our favor.  Let us now hope for better treatment as we head mostly west, with the odds for favorable winds clearly against us. The day on the road was prolonged today by an unusual amount of historical sightseeing.  We saw the Double Ditch Indian village site, currently being excavated, directly across the river from a Lewis and Clark campsite.  Undoubtedly, the inhabitants were in contact with the Corps of Discovery.  A bit further on, we visited the Fort Mandan replica, located 12 miles downriver from the original site, but a most interesting exhibit depicting the conditions endured for the winter of 1804-1805.  Finally, we visited the Knife River Indian Villages Interpretive Site, with a replica of a Hidatsu earth lodge.         "
281,"OK, I tell you this so I can feel better about myself, a guy who is driven to overcome formidable obstacles, heroically.  But the real truth is, I'm having a good time.  A tailwind would be better, but I'm having a really, really good time.
"
282,"So, with all this headwind action, why isn't there any team riding, or paceline drafting going on?  Good question.  This is a small group.  Most of the smaller group that rides all the miles every day are not inclined, and don't feel they are suffering that much without it.  There is no 'Team Testosterone' swooshing by to demonstrate the advantages.  For my part, I'd be useless; almost no one climbs as slowly as I do, so the terrain rules it out.  Hills were not a factor in our one paceline experiment earlier in the tour.  After the tough time yesterday, only Tony, Tom, Georg, Dan, Bill, Bruce, Axel, and I avoided a ride in the van today.  Thank heaven for Bill!  He moves at his own speed, makes the stops he wants to make, and gets to the destination point under his own power.  Without him, I would have been DFL, dead last, arriving at the motel today.   "
283,"You've heard this before in this chronicle:  Culbertson ain't much of a place.  But the proprietors of the Kings Inn are some of the most accommodating people on the planet.  We were immediately supplied with cleaning rags for our bikes (yeah, they want to avoid our using the towels, but one motel manager's response earlier was simply to ban the bikes).  When we inquired about where we could get a beer, a call was made to make sure the place was open on the 4th.  When it seemed we would face a 12-block round trip in the rain, it was:  'Our red truck is right outside, the keys are in the visor, the only condition is you don't open any beers until you're back here.'  It was OK to set up our makeshift cooler in the lobby, too.  The people in the restaurant across the street are terrific, too.   Montana is off to a good start.  We'll be here a long, long while - 16 days in all.         "
284,"It rained again today, much like yesterday; there was a little rain to start, then a long, threatening fairly dry time, and a final shower before arrival.  That easterly tailwind was there, too.  I missed one of the turns on to a reservation road and had a fairly solitary ride on US 2 most of the day.  I got a flat, too, (my fourth) and for the second time needed a patch on the tire to continue.  I replaced the rear tire when I got in, which seemed so new, after about 1200 miles.  That's a bit of a short life for a tire, but not all that unusual.  Something put a quarter-inch gash in it today. Tomorrow is another short day, but the rain, and the tailwind, should be gone.             "
285,"Early in the day, some horses were loose on the road.  I took some one-handed pictures as I rode by.  No, they showed no interest at all in me. Of the truly fast guys, Tom rode with Carla today, and Tony somehow dawdled or socialized early.  That left Dan, Georg, and me in the lead. After a stop in Nashua at Bergie's for their famous home-made ice cream, we three were the first to arrive at The Fort Peck Hotel, an old-style place built in the Depression as part of a major dam-building WPA project.  It could be right out of a movie set - see 'Deadwood' on HBO this year - with a veranda across the front; lobby, bar, and dining room in the center of the first floor; and rooms upstairs.  Georg, Dan, and I took up positions at the bar, ate lunch, and greeted each arriving bicyclist.  Axel and Bruce were among the many who joined us.         "
286,"The morning weather report warned of a violent thunderstorm to arrive by evening.  We started out under a threatening sky into a ferocious dead-on headwind, fearing we would thereby reach that storm sooner that way.  Six of the group hopped into the van, opting for a 40-mile headstart.  The wind abated somewhat after 25 miles; a little later, the sun came out.  I saw clouds in the distance shedding rain as I approached Jordan, and we did have some light rain during dinner.  The big storm?  I think we either rode around it, or it didn't happen.       "
287,"I rode alone, firmly in the middle of our widely-spaced group. There were severe warnings about tonight's hotel.  It's old and run-down; bathrooms are shared, it's located in a town of a few hundred in population.  There are no alternatives; Lewistown would be too far for today; re-routing would have had us on US 2 with the semi-trailers and less scenery for three or four days.  With all that build-up, complaints were not heard - clever folks, these Gottsegens.  About half the group, Georg and I included, stayed in the new part:  pristine, if basic, with functioning private bathrooms, no phones, no TV, no (unneeded) air conditioning.  The people in the old part shared the johns, but they coped, and laughed about it. Between old and new was a truly beautiful garden, with a huge, multi-trunk, spreading tree in its center (I'm told it's a kind of poplar, but I think it's maybe an alder; are they related?).  We sat under that much of the afternoon, with beer, the boom box, and much BS.  Dinner in town was maybe a bit disappointing; the wine was in airline bottles; but the pies for dessert were spectacular.  (Equally so the cinnamon rolls in the morning.)     "
288,"After a glimpse of the Snowy Mountains in the distance, today's ride took us over the Judith Mountains, named for Captain Clark's fiancée, whose name was Julia.  How Julia translates to Judith was not explained; perhaps it was just his inability to spell.  Lewistown is not named for Captain Lewis, so my curiosity dissolves before any effort to find out who its namesake really was.  We also saw stands of evergreens that looked like actual timber. As I'm sure was related in the other journals, Dan spent the night after Day 2 in the hospital.  He worked hard in the heat, drank a prodigious amount of water, but didn't eat enough.  He absorbed four liters of saline intravenously before his electrolytes were back in synch.  Tonight he got a cake, a card, a chorus of the bloody song, and a pound of salt.  May he live long, and put the sex back in sexagenarian - his wife and family will be in our area for several days beginning Sunday. This hotel, The Yogo Inn, is located on the site of an excavation that uncovered a rock marker, along with documentation that it was surveyed as the exact center of Montana by one Will 'Pickhandle Burke' Stafford in 1903.  This information is presented on the back of the dinner menu.  Will was, of course, my great-grandfather.  But you all knew that. How am I doing so far?  Really well, I think.  The aches and pains (soreness in the butt, and a chronic cramp in the middle of my back), and the lack of stamina for long distances, experienced in the first week or so, have about completely disappeared.  These were clearly related to my insufficient preparation for the ride, and I feel a lot better -- I'm doing a lot better -- than I thought I would at this point.  Those compression pains in my feet still crop up on long days, but that's age, or maybe the shoes, not training.       "
289,"As is often the case now, a long day amplifies the differences in cycling speeds.  Those ahead get way ahead; those behind are further behind.  I am really alone in the middle.  The traffic has been so light lately that when I stop, there is no sound at all, but for a few insects buzzing.           "
290,"I got my laundry done, made a call to Susan in Chicago, got a long-overdue haircut, found a Radio Shack (increased the memory in my camera by a factor of 32), and hit the ATM.  Gotta buy tires again tomorrow.         "
291,"I also visited the Lewis and Clark Interpretive Center, which is situated just above what is left of a couple of the five falls that gave the town its name.  There is now a dam above each of these which right now, with flow levels low, make the great falls mighty puny.  The exhibits and programs at the center are quite worthwhile, and emphasize the month-long ordeal of the portage around the great falls that was originally expected to take a mere half day. As I was leaving the center, I talked to Lyle Monroe (I hope I have his first name right), from Great Falls. Dinner tonight was at Ristorante Portofino, a better-than-usual (for us) spot in the near-deserted downtown of Great Falls.  Everything I had was great, but the service was deeply flawed, and some of the entrées ordered by others disappointing.         "
292,"94 miles made it a longish trip, and my headwind battle, which seems like a daily routine but isn't, mercifully didn't begin until about 70 miles were logged.  So it was then a fairly quick grind along Interstate 15 and along a busy commercial strip to our hotel. Our restaurant was a really good one, the Stone House, marred only by an impossibly supercilious maître d'hôtel.           "
293,"The highlight of today's ride was a long - it must have been eight or ten miles - and gentle descent into the Missouri valley for the last time.  The lowlight was the heavy truck and RV traffic.   I rode much of the way with Georg and Dan.  I had a late start because of a room flat, but Dan compensated by having two on the road, so we got together about 20 miles out.  Just 67 miles, it was an early arrival at the Broken Spur.  Advertising slogan:  Sleep at the Broken Spur, on a broken spring (it's really a pretty good place). You've heard this before:  Three Forks doesn't seem much of a place.  But the folks at Headwaters, tonight's restaurant, are wonderful.  Yeah, that's true, but this time, it's with more than just enough culinary skill to deliver what we all agree has been our best meal of the tour.  A wonderful night.  The Chicago boys started things off with a little impromptu cheese-and-cracker-Canadian Whiskey gathering in the hotel lobby.  At the restaurant, I ordered a couple of bottles of the closest thing to Champagne that was available, and instigated a singing of La Marseillaise.  Turns out we have considerable talent in the chorus (we could have been doing more of this earlier, but maybe it's best to just let these things ripen as they will).  With a great meal, and a few other stimuli, we had a ball. Dick, perceptive and jocular at once, thought of the newbies who will be joining us in Missoula, and asked what we could sing to them, 'that would scare the living hell out of them.'  Immediately, there were murmurs that I might be able to handle that.  Yes.  I offered the 'blazing piles' toast and the 'Sodomy' song from 'Hair.'  Those, and the 'bloody song' might do it.  The toast, somewhat bowdlerized for this public medium, goes like this: May the blazing piles torment you;May corns grow on your feet;May crabs as big as cockroachesCrawl 'round your balls, and eat. When all the world's forsaken you,And your life's a total wreck,May you fall through your dirty bung-hole,And break your [bleep]ing neck. In my observation, the group has been poised for this [where we really have a good time, and feel,  and behave, as if we've been good friends for a long, long time] for a week or two now.  In later chapters I will inflict on you my theories of the difference between this small group and the larger groups I have observed and chronicled crossing the US from coast to coast.  The operative point right now is that the Hard Core of Discovery (or the Durable Dozen) has bonded, and feels a strong need to cohere socially.  As I see it, some sort of coming together of the group dynamic is inevitable in a situation like this.  Despite cellphones and the internet, we're really disconnected from our regular lives; the timeline runs well beyond a normal 1-2 week vacation; and we all face a fairly challenging common task each day.  Relationships are formed with people we'd not be likely to get close to in other circumstances. Enough of the amateur behavioral science.  Carol the new, who is some kind of senior administrator at Lesley University in Cambridge, Massachusetts, did a doctoral dissertation on the group dynamic of an Outward Bound program.  Unfortunately, she leaves us next Monday in Missoula.  Perhaps she'll offer some educated insights by email before the tour ends.     "
294,"Tomorrow, we have short miles, but two, count 'em, two real mountain passes to negotiate.           "
295,"I was overtaking Ila, who was just a few hundred feet ahead, when I saw her go off the pavement into soft sand and flop into the road.  As I approached, she assured me she was not seriously hurt, and had all she would need.  In fact, she flashed a sly smile, apparently relishing the opportunity to put to use some of the considerable supplies, equipment, and stuff for every contingency that she carries. In the early days of the trip, Ila started out every day burdened with two panniers in the rear, a handlebar bag, a big fanny pack, a Camelback (a backpack water supply), and two water bottles.  She took every suggestion about preparedness for weather or mishap to mean she had to have all kinds of clothes and stuff with her, on the bike, at all times.  Cajolery (and maybe just a little teasing) have persuaded her to replace the panniers and handlebar bag with a (large) rack trunk, but the fanny pack, and the municipal water supply remain. Anyway, after I stopped to offer help, she whipped open the rack trunk.  Two EMT's in scrubs, with stethoscopes around their necks, immediately jumped out of it and had her strapped to a backboard and an oxygen mask on her nose before she could explain she only had a skinned knee.  I was so amazed I never thought to take any pictures. We have definitely attained some altitude today.  We peaked at 7,423 feet and we're going to sleep at 6600, up from 5100 feet at Dillon last night.  One of my ballpoint pens squirted half its ink.  We'll give it all back tomorrow, with just a small climb to 7,259 feet, and a descent all the way to 3800 feet in Hamilton.  It's the real deal, too; Chief Joseph Pass marks the continental divide in these parts. Jackson Hot Springs Lodge has cabins without phones, TV, or air conditioning (we'd have used it in the afternoon, but it's not really essential), a big outdoor swimming pool fed by the hot springs.  I had a good soak.  Almost everyone had lunch in Rose's Cantina across the street, and it was good.  We had a fine dinner at the lodge, and the lobby TV carried OLN, letting us see Lance Armstrong's first real move in the mountains.         "
296,"The Big Hole battlefield site, where we immigrant Americans, with the full support of our government, in 1877 committed one of the many atrocities against native Americans, was a worthwhile stop. I hit a rock and had a high-speed blowout on the descent.  I guess I learned why the bike-handling sessions I have attended so strongly emphasize avoiding obstacles first and foremost with the front tire.  The sudden deflation in the rear didn't threaten control at all. This was the last night for the second-stage-only people.  We lamented the passing of Carol II, Bill, and Jill back into the real world.           "
297,"This was the first night for the newbies.  Dick and Carol provided a plonk and cheese half-hour reception before dinner.  Members of The Hard Core of Discovery noted this hadn't happened in Alton, when we were all newbies.  I iced up four bottles of Mumm's Cuvee Napa and pushed it to new and old alike.  I did not offer the 'blazing piles' toast; instead, I proposed a warm welcome, quashed the rumor that the third-stagers would be required to clean our chains, but let them know that freshman beanies would be distributed Tuesday morning.  They also might be asked to memorize key passages from Captain Clark's journal, with all the spelling errors annotated.  Then we sang them the bloody song.
"
298,"Nothing means (almost) nothing.  I bought tires - again!  Georg, Dan, Allan, and I had a beer under a tree in the parking lot, walked to Missoula's famous carousel (one ride), and had lunch.  I'm bringing this journal up to date.       "
299,"Our paceline of four - or 'train' as we call it -- develops slowly, with initial random pulls of two or three miles at 18-21 mph.  As the climb toward Lolo Pass tightens a bit, our discipline becomes more strict, with pulls of just one mile, but the speed stays right up there.  There is not much wind. I fall back a bit when the climb begins in earnest, about three miles from the summit, but it's still never a real grinder.  I never get down all the way to my bottom gear, but I feel the effect of the effort we put in on the paceline earlier. We dawdle at the Interpretive Center at the summit, where Montana becomes Idaho, Mountain Time becomes Pacific Time, and 9:30 AM becomes 8:30.  Unlike the part we climbed, the descent looks like a real mountain pass, even though we're only coming down from 5,235 feet.  We start the descent at 9:00 and arrive at Lochsa Lodge at 9:30.  There we eat a real breakfast, which we charge to Timberline.  Tony, who did eat at Knucklehead's, arrives while we eat. We buy beer and ice at the general store on the site, set up the boom-box (after arrival of the van), and observe later arrivals. Georg and I were assigned a modern, spacious cabin with a full bathroom, sofa, gas-fired faux fireplace, tight-fitting screens, and more.  Others lacked screens, showers, even toilets.  If you can't be smart, be lucky.  Life is good.                 "
300,"Dick gives us a familiar-sounding speech about the easiest 117 miles you'll ever do.  He's right.  We follow the Lochsa River 64 miles downstream (and downhill) to where it joins the Selway to form the Clearwater.  The scenery is spectacularly beautiful. I start out a couple of minutes late, and after 30 miles or so, I see the train that was not to be, stopped at the side of the road.  It soon regroups behind me, and we paceline much as we did yesterday, for about 65 miles, with some stops.  The traffic gets heavy, and the road is often narrow and shoulderless.  Numerous heavy trucks and RV trailers squeeze us dangerously toward the edge of the pavement, even sending Tom into the weeds once. Justice, seemingly, is done, on one occasion.  On a tightly winding stretch, with much traffic in both directions, Georg is attempting to hold the vehicles behind us until there is a clear space for safe passing.  An RV driver who wants none of that pulls his rig into the left lane on a blind turn, forcing a near-miss with an oncoming car.  A trooper with flashing lights also goes by.  Soon we see them both off to the side.  We refrain from even the most innocuous of hand signals.  Then the trooper goes by again, followed, not at all closely, by the RV, which does a reprise of the blind-corner trick.  The cop's too far ahead to see it.  Finally, we pass the same RV pulled off to the right, in a rest area.  Uh oh, says Dan.  I think of a shotgun on the driver's windowsill.  Nothing happens, though. I drop back for the last 20 miles or so.  I'm the one, not Dan, who can't hammer like that for 117 miles.  Still, I get to the Ponderosa before the others finish the first beer.  We talk to Patty, the brittle manager the bartender calls 'The Warden.'  Patty calls the bartender 'The Bitch.'  A dysfunctional organization.       "
301,"After Georg got his room-flat fixed, what has become the customary four of us started out together.  That came apart real fast.  About four miles out, Tom (the older) stopped to see a Lewis and Clark dugout canoe-making site, and the irrepressible Dan pulled Georg away from me before I was fully warmed up; or it would have happened anyway; I don't know.  I rode the last few miles with Alex, 16, the youngest member of our group.  At 10:10 AM, the rooms were not ready, so we repaired to the bar somewhat earlier than usual.  See pictures.  Many joined us as the morning wore on, testimony to the now-mature group-bonding process. Since Carol is due to depart again to lead another hiking tour, Tom and Carla decided to present the gift from the Durable Dozen to Carol and Dick tonight.               "
302,"I just ground it out.  I stopped for lunch after 65 miles, in Dayton, to enable a full cool-down and rehydration.  Many others stopped in the same health-food place.  At the end of the day, I rode in with young Tom, and Alex. Dinner was outstanding.  I had steamed clams, followed by halibut grilled with parmesan.  Rob is our new wine guru.  He may be one of those guys who can take a sip and say 'balanced and delicate, with mild tannins, and overtones of black currants and pencil-shavings at the finish,' with a straight face.  Anyway, he delivers.  He knocked 30 miles off today's route (in the van) so he would have time to visit a winery, and brought two of the wines he bought there to dinner.  And shared them.  The Cabernet Franc was the perfect companion to the halibut, handily winning over the Merlot, and the pedestrian Chardonnay I bought by the glass from the restaurant.  Rob has some others stashed in one of the vans.  I need to choose my seat carefully at the dinners to come.               "
303,"We're in Oregon, our last state, and we've got just over 400 miles to go.  I passed Tony twice on the road today.  No, I haven't achieved Tour de France form, and Tony's not sick.  It's the tour-nearing-the-end phase.  We feel more of a need to be with our fellows now.  It's a grieving process in anticipation of the finish, even though we'll feel glad to be home again.  It will still be a mighty letdown from the 48-day regime of ride-eat-sleep.  The new folks, on the other hand, haven't reached their halfway mark, but we're winding down, and ruing it. That ride-with-the-pack compulsion may never affect Dan and Georg.  The urge to surge ahead is just too strong in those guys, I think. Attention Mr. and Mrs. America, and all the ships at sea:  There has been a major development in the ongoing saga of the Hard Core of Discovery.  Ila has ridden ten miles without her rack trunk.  She overtook Tom and Carla - on a hill, no less - during that stretch.  Questioned after the ride, she said, 'I felt fine,' but would not speculate on plans for tomorrow.  Tune in again, same time, same station.   "
304,"I was on the road at 6:30, and the wind was strong by 8:00 or 8:30.  And then it became unequivocally the strongest, and longest (65 miles) headwind I have ever faced.  Today's climbs were not trivial either, but the verdict would be unchanged if the ride were perfectly flat.  This was a tough day - the mother of all tough bicycling days - for me. The scenery was commanding, but stark, with huge treeless bluffs on either side of the river.  Added to the headwind, one thinks, why am I on this planet? I rode alone, but I did trail a group from the Habitat for Humanity trek for about five miles, going into Roosevelt.  I think most of that gang sagged from there.  They are a young bunch (college age?) going across the US east to west, having started in Connecticut. Of the Hard Core of Discovery, Tony, Dan, Tom, Georg, Bruce, and I rode all the way today.  Newbies Joyce, Alex, Andy, and Carla did, too.             "
305,"This was the night of the dinner cruise - a real sternwheeler on the Columbia.  Carol's hiking group, including her son Kian, her brother-in-law, and her nephew all joined us.  It was a welcome change, a chance to be on one of these rivers for once, and we didn't have to build a boat, or paddle it.               "
306,"McMenamin's Edgefield is an outstanding place, with a brewery, a winery, and a distillery all on the premises.  I did not sample the wares at the distillery.  There are some limits, you know.  The India Pale Ale was excellent, as were several of the wines (all that I tasted were quite good, in fact).  I bought two bottles, a reserve Pinot Noir, and a Syrah, which I spread around at dinner. Today I realize how much the 88-mile ride into the wind two days ago took out of me.  I feel I've only now recovered.  I reached my limit somewhere way short of the finish that day, and kept going - on what, I don't know.  Of course it feels good to think about having prevailed, but I don't know how smart that really was.                         "
307,"Tomorrow's trip looks even more basic:  Turn left out of motel; ride 68.5 miles; turn right into motel.  We're nearly at the end of our seven weeks, with less than 100 miles to go.  We can't remember not bicycling every day, except distantly, in another era, another life.  There's a big change, a paradigm shift, coming up.  Maybe that extra week of cycling in Wisconsin will be a good thing after all.  Give me time to decompress.   "
308,"The ride was a fairly quick and pleasant 68 miles entirely along US 30.  It was a little hillier and more scenic than yesterday's ride led us to expect.  I got in fairly early and got busy doing my laundry - I've got another week of cycling in Wisconsin to do.   Following my own personal tradition for such ending celebrations, I contributed some good sparkling wine (all from Oregon, in this case) to accelerate the festive feeling - totally unnecessary, I'm sure.  Nothing could hold this group back.  Highlights of the evening were a topical poem by Leslie - text reproduced on http://www.crazyguyonabike.com/doc/lewisandclark2004 -- and a pretty sentimental outpouring from Dick.  Not everyone at Timberline was convinced all along that this thing could be pulled off, or that it would draw enough participants to fly economically.  Dick had the vision and doggedness to carry through the planning, mapping, driving run-through, and cue-sheet writing.  Carol did most of the motel and meal booking and arranging.  The participants, nearly all of whom are veterans of several Timberline tours (some as many as 15), laid on their appreciation.  With no prior Timberline experience, I am now a committed, partisan Timberline alumnus.  Dick, may there be some kind of west-to-east return trip in 2006, even if it doesn't go quite all the way to St. Louis. I attempted a person-by-person summary of my thoughts on the members of the Durable Dozen.  I'm afraid I could not match the excellent mix of sarcasm and insight that Roger Berthold achieved in his similarly-formatted talk at the end of the ride across America in 2000.  But I tried: Carla - Bruised, battered, she persists.  She observes wildlife where I never notice it.  I swear the prairie dogs popped their heads up to see her. Allan - Is he verbose?  When Dick playfully told him to shut up a few weeks ago, my immediate, reflexive thought was, ' Is that possible?'  We do know more than we needed to about his bypass and prostate surgeries, but a lot less about physics and the philosophy of science.  I bet he is a most entertaining lecturer [at the University of Colorado], and that Cindy [his wife] is a saint. Bruce - We never got our duet ready.  He's the one with real musical ability and training, and you couldn't shut me up. Axel - Understated wit.  Zing!  He's nailed you - elegantly.  And be on the lookout for those spelling, grammar, or syntax errors - he is. Ila - Can't say enough about Ila.  Easily the most-improved cyclist of the group, and the hands-down winner of the good sport award. Dan - On some good days (for me), I managed to ride with him and Sig, and later in the tour with Georg.  It didn't take a special day to enjoy a few beers with those guys, though.  Just find the nearest bar. Tony - Smooth-pedallin' laid-back, burrito-lovin' guy.  The group's class act in bicycling terms.  It's not the bike, or the French toast and hash-browns (with ketchup), either. Georg - My roommate.  Up 15 minutes before the alarm.  Out with his luggage 15 minutes early.  Asleep at 9:00 PM.  In between, a dynamo.  On the hills, a mountain goat.  (That makes me the old goat.) Irwin - Loquacious, charming, always positive, even when he skewers a pretentious headwaiter with 'Mr. L. A.'  A classy guy. Joe - Ooh, a Republican who thinks.  There's hope.  I think his clients are some lucky people. Tom - Organizer of websites.  Constant arranger of snapshots.  The definitive diarist of the tour.  If he hadn't turned up, things would have been way different.  We could not have invented him.             "
309,"There were various little goodbyes in the afternoon as some of us packed our bikes for shipment – many just gave their rentals back to Timberline.  Although there was another small group from the tour at the same motel, our logistical chores kept us from dining together, and the day ended with a quiet dinner for four:  Georg, Tom, Carla, and me.  We were all booked on the same flight to Chicago in the morning, so that really final goodbye was stretched out a bit.             "
310,"A couple of cell-phone calls later, I am met exactly as planned by Janae, my best biking buddy since 1989.  She zips me and my luggage off to a Super8 in Port Washington, where I will share a room with Bob, a guy I've biked with - and downed a few beers with - since 1984.   The American Lung Association's Chicago unit used to run a week-long ride called Bicycle Across the Magnificent Miles of Illinois - BAMMI.  I will spend this week with the tenacious remainder of a gang that coalesced in the campsites, on the roads, and in the bars of that ride over more than a dozen years.  The BAMMI came to an end in 1996, so the group now typically picks a ride in Wisconsin or Michigan to serve in its place.  In addition, Bob, Janae, and I have branched out to rides in the Colorado Rockies, a few RAGBRAIs, and last year biked the Blue Ridge Parkway with a tour group. Janae is a formidable cyclist;  she was the impetus behind our joining a tour group with another BAMMI alumnus (not here this week) that went from Vancouver to Banff.  She did about a third of the US crossing that I did in 1994, and all of the one in 2000.  She's a real athlete who ran track in college.  Her time for 800 meters stood as a Big 10 record for several years after she graduated from the University of Illinois.  Now she leads spin classes three times a week;  she has the lungs, and the personality, for that.  How does somebody like me ride with her?  Only if she lets me.  Hey, I've been training for seven weeks, and there are no mountains on this week's route.  So I'll do a little better.  Maybe.   "
311,"It’s raining as we set off, but that ends before we’re done with breakfast.  We drive to the staging area, where most of the 1,200 participants in this event will pick up identification tags for their luggage and their bikes; get wrist-banded; and put their bikes on a semi.  My two duffels go in the belly of the bus (one of some three dozen), and the bike case stays in Janae’s trunk. The reunion expands a little in the parking lot; in addition to Bob, Janae, Robin, Vicki, Jim, Frank and me, who all met for dinner last night, we now add Shirley and Larry.  Our group will number eleven eventually.  As the bus is pulling out, we see Sanj drive in.  No one was sure whether or not she would make it.  Ken is driving directly to Marinette; he will be with us for the week, but will not bicycle. We are dropped off at a high school, and now my world has really changed.  We don’t check into a motel.  We pitch our tents on the school’s front lawn, and spend the night there.  Nocturnal bladder calls are dealt with by putting shoes on, unzipping and rezipping the tent door, finding a boys’ room in the school, returning, and repeating the zip/unzip business.  The only luxury (?) is that the tent is mine and mine alone, with no one else to be accommodated by sharing space, limiting noise, light, etc.  Big deal.                       "
312,"The dressing/packing/departure ritual is much more involved now, with the bathroom at a distance and shared with hundreds, not just one roommate; the added task of striking and packing the tent; and a much longer haul for twice as much luggage. The ride was almost all on quiet country roads, and virtually flat.  Although I shifted gears within a narrow range, I could have comfortably ridden with no shifting at all.  I haven’t experienced that in several years, to say nothing of the past seven weeks.  Janae and I alternated between riding at the slower pace of our main group, and some mild hammering, into a slight headwind at times.  Janae is still faster and stronger, but for the first time in recent history, I seem to be close enough that we can really ride together.   "
313,"It’s one thing to chronicle events or details, trivial and otherwise, of a seven-week trek up the Missouri to its headwaters, crossing the mountains and the continental divide, and then following headwaters, tributaries, and the Columbia itself to the Pacific Ocean, all against the truly historic backdrop of the achievements of Lewis and Clark and the Corps of Discovery.  I don’t want to suggest that I’ve done either endeavor, mine or theirs, any kind of justice here.  But I rode the miles, and put down what came into my head at the time.  I’ve got a record, in parallel with theirs on some level.  This week was, for me, a joyous one of reunion with my dearest friends in bicycling.  It’s been seven years since the last time I had a week-long outing with them. The trip down the Wisconsin part of Lake Michigan’s west coast took us through beautiful, lush scenery and great resort locations – with good restaurants for the most part.  From a bicycling point of view, the 340 miles were not challenging.  That seemed just fine, for my eighth week in the saddle.  The pictures will tell some of it, but as those who have tracked all of the web journals will agree, as a photographer, I am no Tom Fortmann. SAGBRAW, Sprocket’s Annual Great Bicycle Ride Across Wisconsin (not to be confused with GRABAAWR, run by the same people), was a great way to alleviate the emotional letdown after the Lewis and Clark odyssey.  I had a great time, and ended really looking forward to getting home and back into now-unfamiliar routines.                                           "
314,"Now I'm on the airplane, about to land in Philadelphia, looking forward to a reunion with Lucia and Cleopatra, our two cats.  Susan will be back from Santa Fe on the nineteenth - after a couple of days of her own with Jeff, Julie, and Augie. So, what are the few pithy, profound insights that will sum up and put this great adventure into perspective?  Pithy? - well, maybe there were a couple of ideas briefly bandied about; I'm not sure any would really be summarizing thoughts.  Profound? - I don't think so.  Maybe they'll pop into place after a later rereading.  I invite your input. [Now it is later; almost Halloween.  The summarizing thoughts are still not profound, but one needs to wrap this thing up.  First of all, how does a bike trip relate to the the grand historic achievement that was commemorated?  I'll stick with the analogy idea.  OK, the Hard Core of  Discovery looks mighty puny compared to the real Corps of Discovery.  But our effort was far from mere trivia, and it made me think a whole lot more than I otherwise would have about both the detail and the grand sweep of theirs. And how about the comparison of a small group of twelve with the sixty or so observed in seven-week crossings of the US in 1994 and 2000?  Well, I've tried to be observant all three times, and I have some good notes.  I don't think my amateur status as a behavioral scientist is at all threatened at this point.  Yes, the stuff about getting close to people you wouldn't get close to in a business setting or in more ordinary social situations is fairly certain.  Likewise the group bonding as the  weeks progress.  The larger groups are more tempting -- a bigger sample -- in terms of discerning some sort of ""group personality"", but I can't take it beyond that.  My bottom line:  relating to the other people on the trip trumps scenery, cycling, history, etc.] It's been a great trip.  Thank you for joining me.                 "
315,"But as I got off the plane this afternoon, and the 25degree sunshine hit me, yù'know, those worries disappeared pretty smartish. Here I am then, in Riccione, Italy, about to spend five weeks riding as a bike guide. It is something I have wanted to do for many years, and I am very excited. Yes, there are concerns about how I will get on in these unfamiliar roads, and if I get lost, how will I ask the way, but I figure it is better to throw myself in and find out, than not find out at all. Expect only sporadic updates of this journal. Most days will be kind of repetitve anyway - got up, guided some punters, ate some food. But I will let you know of any exciting variations from the norm. Ciao!   "
316,"I don't get settled until we are at cruise altitude, but along the way, there is the worst of all moments. When you take off, the engines are at full power. A short while after take off, they are slowed down, and elevation gain is more gentle. This manifests itself in a surge that is easily felt. And even though I know exactly what it is, every single time, I think it is the engines dying. Today, we were almost at cruising altitude, when there was a clatter on the outside of the plane. It wasn't turbulence, and it was not the undercarriage. I have no idea what it was, but it absolutely terrified me. As soon as the clatter happened, I felt a flood of adrenalin spill into my chest, it surged rapidly upwards, burning my throat, and leaving me with a bitter taste. My brain was saying ""Everything is okay,"" but my heart was trying to pump itself out its cavity. Of course, whatever it was was nothing consquential, but that isn't how it felt at the time. Am I the only one becoming more nervous? Is it an age thing: having been around for so long, I see more and more bad news, and it all piles up in my mind? Is it all down to the terrorism in today's world? Well, I dunno. As a rational adult, I know the risk is minimal, but it does not stop the risk. My recent landing in Berlin did not help either - the pilot apparently decided to drop the last ten foot as quick as possible. How the tyres didn't collapse, I have no idea, but the screaming passengers did not appreciate it! I am still here though, so things cannae be that bad."
317,"It is such a wonderful region. We went up to Urbino on day one - a high, bug University town. Back home in England, uni town would normally mean ugly 60s buildings, grotty student hangouts and kebab shops. Urbino? a slight contrast. An ancient walled city, tiny cobbled streets, views of the mountains around, and a great vibe. Everyone looks gorgeous and very laid back. Magic. Today we went up to Gammano, which was on the ""Gothic Line"", an important line of defence between the Brits and the Germans in 1944. Gemmano is the best place i have been to while here. A stiff, hot, climb to the top of this fortified little town, but once up at the top, there 360deg views all around - to the sea, to Tuscany, to San Marino. Stunning place, and with a scarily steep descent out of the other side. A great day's riding.
"
318,"Talk turns to the Tour De France, and I say how great I think Lance Armstrong is. THis is his trigger to launch into the ""he must be on drugs"" argument. I find the Lance story incredible, and one tiny bit of me does think it is too good to be true. But I believe he wouldn't do drugs.  But the old man, oh no, ""he's stretched the gullibility of the biking world so far it's unbelievable."" There follows a debate that is rather ridiculous. I won't recount it at this stage, because later on we end up at the same dinner table with some other riders. And the same argument, line for line, are repeated by him.  So, we get the ""stretched the gullibility"" line again, and all the following. My replies are in the square brackets: ""Before cancer, he only finished 34th, which is average. No, it's less than average."" [34th. Out of 120 finishers. Ummm, not average] - he had no answer to this. ""He must be on drugs, he's too succesful not to be."" [But he's one of the most tested athletes of all time, and there has been no positive test yet, despite prolonged determined attempts to dsicredit him] His reply, ""The tests are not good enough then."" ** ""You can't be any good after cancer. Being so close to death wouldn't help him."" [Someone else said  - er, but if you read his book, which the old man had done, that's why he got better  -being close to death focussed his mind.] I pointed out that Graham Obree [Track cycling world 1hr record holder, as well as manic depressive] was successful because he faced death and didn't care, which brought out the classic line: ""Yeah, but he's only good at track, that was all he was ever good at, and nobody cares about him out of Britain"" At which point I almost fell off my chair. Only good at track? Well, first of all he was also a top time trialler. And, er being good at track cycling? Didn't track cycling capture all our imaginations at the Olympics? And isn't track cycling, like, brutally, mentally, physically ridiculous and tough to be the best at? And Obree is a fellow Brit, an innovator, someone who's radical riding posture was copied by everyone? Along went the argument, with more repeated lines, and more being shot down. He started saying that you coudln't say Lance is the greatest cyclist ever because he only ever wins the tour. Fair enough, but he also started harping on about how Eddie Mercx was the last great cyclist. To which someone said, ""Yeah, but he was on drugs too"".  Old bod's reply, intended to end the argument and prove himself right was ""yes, but they were on less sophisticated drugs than Lance, so they must have been better."" I gave up at this point. Only to find out later he rides with my dad regularly. Hopefully the story of this debate won't get home. Phew, I've got that rant over with. I expect there will be another rant as soon as the next mad customer comes our way. ** Actually, I conced this could be true, but as I said, I have faith that he doesn't take drugs. If he is ever revealed as a drug cheat, it will be a very sad day - all that cancer money raised on a lie! Which is one of the reasons I don't believe he's a doper"
319,"Last night, she told me I would be leading the ""Romantic"" tours for the next six days. Romantic is a euphemism for short and slow. This is not in itself a problem, short and slow is good. But, I haven't yet gotten to know all the routes, so this comes as some surprise. Particularly as the route I need to take goes through the maze of Cattolica south from here. I roughly know the way, but there is one particular section that is really going to cause me a problem. My solution, get up at 6am, ride out to this junction, and ride back in time for breakfast at the hotel. Which means I have done 20km before the day is barely begun! This turned out to be the fastest riding of the day, because the actual route took nearly five hours for a total distance of a massiv 45km! It was actually good fun. Only three riders, and I didn't get lost, or lose them. Apart from the real slow riding, the group were fun, and we stopped to take in the views. It was a great route along the coast road, lots of lovely churches and views. And a great vintage motorbike tour went past us too - scores of ancient old two-wheelers. A whole week of ""Romance"" though? I may have to convince that we should rotate a bit..."
320,"But not before an extremely long and hot ride. It was oh so hot, and disgustingly humid. We rode flat for a couple of hours, and after coffee, headed uphill for two hours. The views in the area were stunning - vine groves on the slopes around, and castles and churches dotted about the hilltops around us. I took the group maybe a little higher than I should have done, I think they all started to suffer. The more so because we hadn't had a chance to fill up the water bottles for a long time. This led to most of us riding in the 30deg heat for over an hour with no water left. It wasn't good. But, it wasn't so bad that people were pissed off; I think everyone had a good time. Today we rode up to San Marino - 840m high. The route I took was the most direct, but even the direct route cannot escape the climb. You have to get up the 840m somehow. And it really doesn't help if after half the climb you take the group the wrong way down a very steep hill (10% gradient) for 2km, only to realise you have gone the wrong way, and then tell the group they have to go back the way they came. Whoops! I think I am just about getting away with these mistakes, people don't seem too pissed off with me. But even so, internally I think it is a really bad mistake to make! I guess none of the group were too upset, one of them tipped me this morning as they left to go home. Now that's a buzz, getting tipped for essentially being happy and pointing them up and down hills.
"
321,"I'm trying to read the group's reaction. They're talking about wanting to go home, but a couple of the six riders look like they really want to carry on. How do you deal with this? The decision is mine, but I want to keep everyone happy - this is one characteristic of mine that isn't always good. In this situation, I can't keep them all happy. I feel pretty sure that whatever decision I do make, they will be happy with, but it still worries me that if one of two people are not happy I have somehow failed. We fix the flat and carry on to the first village, 10km from the start. It is still raining, so we stop for coffee to see what the weather is doing. Again, it is almost impossible to gauge what people really want to do. Is Tim's ""Oh, I've got a bad hangover"" just his typical wind-up comment, or does he mean it this time. When Trevor says ""Let's just stay until it does rain"" does he mean that? He's extremely fit, and rock hard, so maybe he's just joking. And Michelle, shortest member of the group, very feminine but also excellent on a bike, says ""well, i think we should carry on, it's only rain.""  How is a poor guide supposed to decide what to do? We leave the cafe, it looks bright, but as we emerge, there's a big rumble of thunder. Decision made - I am not guiding people with a threat of lightning; that would be a bad accident waiting to happen. Home we come, but not without another puncture, and, worse, a wheel in a grid moment that spits Karen sideways, and bends her rather nice 16-spoker in half. Whoops. The daft thing is that because the weather was bad, and because *I* decided to come back early, along this road, somehow *I* feel responsible! It may all sound trivial, but i find these decisions pretty stressful. Especially when I am guiding along a road i only know because it is on the map in front of me. The junctions on the map do not always represent the junctions in the real world, and I have to put a lot of trust in Oli, who advises me on the routes each day. It's getting easier, because lots of the roads are now becoming familiar, and my mental map is strengthening, but it is hard work sometimes.  It sure beats being in an office though."
322,"This book is a cracker, the main character is a shock jock. It's written in the first person, so I actually think Banks just wanted to spout off about everything - Bush, Iraq, Commercial Radio, Holocaust Deniers, football, Science Fiction movies. The rants are great, with tight dialogue that feels truly genuine. The plot itself doesn't really get going until halfway through the book, but this is no problem, because all the strands that are developed at the start are entertaining enough.
"
323,"Yesterday, we had two, and this was on a mere 25km cycle ride. Today was crazy. 12 riders, six punctures. At every stop, just as we were about to set off, it seemed someone would cry ""Hang on, I've got a flat."" Or, just as we were getting a great rhythm going, and working as a line, we'd stop to mend another piece of pierced rubber. My pumping arm is pumped to the max.  The punctures have required tactful delegation. Clearly, I would rather not have to do the whole tyre removal, locate-the-hole, replace tube and pump like a nutter routine. But I am The Guide. Therefore, I am expected to Assist. Some people seem to be happy to do it themselves, some sit and let me do it all. One of the German guys, Gerhardt, got a puncture, and the other German guy, Kristoff, on the ride decided to help out. Thing is, it became apparent that the Gerhardt knew exactly what to do, and Kristoff wouldn't let go of the wheel. So they ended up taking forever to do each simple step, pulling the tyre one way or another disturbing the attempts of the other. Gerhardt clearly didn't need, or want the help, but was trapped in the world of politeness that we have in this situation - you can't tell the guy you don't want his help, can you, so instead they muddle on, making an easy job difficult. I just stood by, fainly amused, pump at the ready. By the end of the ride, Patrick, an Irish guy got a flat, I stopped to help, and told the rest of the group to carry on back to the hotel - we were pretty close. He seemed happy to just pump the wheel up and ride, so I lent him my pump, and left him to it. I then had the great, and necessary, idea to take a different route home than the others in order to learn a few more ways in and out of Riccione - it's a bit of a maze, and it is best to bring the group a variety of ways in and out of town in order to stop the finishes becoming boring. Off I head, away from the hotel for a while, happily exploring, until the curse finally gets me, too. Pssssst, and the progress killing feeling of the wheel rim hitting the tarmac. A puncture. And where is my pump? Ah yes, I just lent it to someone. And I am now an hour's walk from home. Arse. Thankfully, I can see the funny side of this, and walk home pretty happily; we did a good ride today, with only one hill climbed in error!"
324,"""We make a climb"", ""I talk you tonight"", ""I wish you well from the heart of my bottom"", or other such daft simple-speak, spattered with the lyrical way that Italians talk. I am making some inroads. I can ask for talcum powder and Vaseline in the chemist. Although I ended up with some perfumed smelly stuff, instead of old faithful petroleum jelly, which is no good for wiping on tender nether regions.  Asking how much things cost is easy, ""Quenta costa,"" but the answers make no sense whatsoever, so I pay for everything with a big enough denomination of note. My saddle bag is weighed down with change from these transactions. I even managed asking for a sandwich in the cafe today, ""Il panino, perfavore,"" but couldn't specify the ham, so ended up with egg."
325,"I got up later than normal, in time to have breakfast and watch everyone leave on their bikes, while plannning a short ride to Rimini, and a day of beach lounging. (you all know where this is going, don't you?) I got up from the table, only to be asked to do about a zillion tedious tasks - mend punctures, fit pedals, adjust saddles, label bike stands. This took me most of the morning, so by the time I set off for my relaxed bike ride, I was stressed and running out of ""rest"" time. Rimini's lovely though, and the Tiberius Bridge (built in 21AD) is pretty special. Back in time for lunch, and FINALLY some time on the beach. Oh, and the water's lovely! Today has been a little of an eye-opener, job wise. I am here as a guide, but there is so much to do in the hotel, everyone has to muck in because there is always so much to do. Unfortunately, the stuff I am skilled at is tediously dull - fitting pedals to 22 bikes isn't a great way to spend an hour, especially with no radio playing in the back ground. It also feels somehow beneath me. I don't mean that in a ""I am too good for this"" way, but, er, a ""hang on, I'm 32, shouldn't I be, like, delegating this to someone"" kind of way.  From tomorrow it is going to be mayhem - something like 60 cyclist guests...
"
326,"That's right, you'd rotate who does which length ride, so that noone has to endure the slow rides too often, coz although cycling at an average speed of 10kph with a bunch of people on shopper bikes and having lots of coffee stops is kind of fun, it's not the kind of riding we would wish to do. And if you told one guide that he has to spend ALL week riding the short rides because on the first day you did it the guests all said what a nice guy Andy is, do you think he would look forward to this with relish and excitement? You got it, I am doomed to ride at a pace so slow i nearly fall of my bike all week. The short rides are fun, it's really chatty, the stops are leisurely and you really get a chance to savour the views. But. Not. Every. Single. Day.  Marina, the boss, has promised Oli and myself (he's one of the other guides on short duty this week) that next week, Liam and Martin (this week's long riders) will do the short duty. But I smell a fish. If she goes back on her word, there could well be one guide less. If I had known she wanted me for short guide rides, do you think I would have come? We shall wait and see. If it all pans out okay, and next week, i get to do the long rides, all will be well.  All of this has to be tempered with the fact that I am able to swim in the warm sea every day, lie on the beach for a couple of hours in nearly 30degrees sunshine, and not get my wallet out for anything. It's still not too bad a life, i do realise."
327,"After the ride, I was sat chatting about cycle touring, and I mentioned my tour to NZ. For some reason, one of the guys asked, ""Er, were you there for about six months?"" ""Yes."" ""Did your dad come out and ride with you for a while?"" ""Er, yes."" ""Did you keep a journal on a site called crazyguyonabike.com?"" ""Yeeessssss."" ""Wow, I read that whole thing, it inspired me to go there, it was a great read."" Rock on! How great is that to find someone, almost randomly, who has read your journal? He's got his own journal, which I will now go read.
"
328,"This plan has been a nightmare to implement with 100 guests, ever-changing info - and yours truly is the last to hear about the changes - and about a hundred million questions that seem inane from the guests. My role for the day - guide the short ride with the help of a local guide we hired for the day. The day went like this: 8am, breakfast, all good. But Marina tells me the short ride is to be two rides - er, but i spent no time planning the route, so haven't a clue where i will be going. 8.01am, Liam says, ""Oh, Andy, I've just realised your bike is needed for another guest."" Cue 25 minutes of frantically changing over saddle, pedals, and all other kit to another bike, instead of loading bikes onto the bus. All the while, answering dumb questions of the guests. 8.30am, bus due to leave. 8.40am, bus leaves, delayed by Andy trying to fix the new bike he has just been given. I will have to live with the broken bottom bracket. 9.45.am Arrive at Urbino. The plan was for riders to ride straight away, the non-riders get a tour.  10am. Bikes unloaded, half the riders complain that they had been told they would be able to go on a tour of Urbino before the ride. Fair enough, they had been told that, earlier in the week, and noone told them the plan was changed. Hey, noone even told me, so how were the customers supposed to know? 1005am. Difficult rearrangement of plan with tour guide Guilia, as we try to work out what to do with 5 riders breathing down our neck while we think. Decision made - the ride starts at 11am, there will be only one ride, and until then they can go on the tour of the town.  Problem - the bikes have already been unloaded, and the bus has gone elsewhere until midday.  Guess which mug has to look after the bikes, in a car park, with no shade, desperate for a pee? While everyone goes to see the stunning 12th century castles, the galleries, and have a coffee I get to sit in a stinking carpark. But, not to worry, I will at least ride the bike and not need to guide. 11am. No sign of the riders, only a guide. 1105am 8 out of 11 riders arrive. Lunch at Furlo is 1330, it's a two hour ride at least. Where are the rest of the group?  1111am. I send off the riders that are there. No sign of the others. No ride for me. I get to stand in this effing car park until midday, and then get the bus to Furlo. 1117. All but one of the rest of the group arrive. I tell them they are too late. I cannot guide them, even if I knew the way, coz that would still leave one bike unguarded. Noone is happy. My happy, professional sheen, is slipping. 1200. Everyone arrives back, including the final rider, ""Oh, sorry, Andy I got lost, it's taken me an hour to find the bus."" This person would get lost in a field, I feel, if she was let loose. Onto the bus, and off to lunch. That works okay. Apart from me fuming in my seat as I drive, not ride, through a spectacular gorge. 1430. I get to ride home, at the back of another group, but still manage to lose the group due to another problem: they dropped off the back, I told the lead guide what had happened and turned round to find them. The problem was that in my confusion of turning round, the missing riders arrived at the back of the group and I didn't see them, so I went to find riders who weren't lost at all.  Finally, though, I am on my own, riding at my pace. So I sprint the last hilly 50km. That all happened yesterday, and as a result, on today's incredible, beautiful, stinkingly hot, hilly, 110km ride, I struggle to keep up with the back markers... Ooops, it's not the best display of bike guiding as I grovel my way round the route. Just another day in Paradise."
329,"What is it with drinking? I've been drinking for 14 years, and hangovers get worse and worse. I also know that being drunk doesn't make me wittier, funnier, more attractive, or more charismatic. It just makes me louder than I already am.  Why then do we keep on drinking like we do? I know that sticking my hand in a flame is going to hurt - it is a learnt response. I also know that binge drinking is daft, but why do I do it? What part of the mind makes you think that it is cool and funny to get totally pissed in an evening? Why can't I think about the hangover instead of the pleasure of the drink? All of this, however, is not the reason for ""pounded."" It actually refers to the little old resort towns of Rimini and Riccione. Two days ago there was lovely sunshine but with a hot, strong wind, the Garbino. This is the forerunner of bad weather. But it never showed up. The following day was sunny, and we had a lovely ride. But it all changed after we had finished the ride. Out to see was a swirling, turbulent mass of grey, racing fast towards us. And with the cloud came wind like I have never seen. We got absolutely battered - trees blown down, into buildings, cars, across the roads. Powerlines were down, anything not secured got blown away. The ride the following day was incredible - we went up the coast through rimini, and the destruction was incredible. Every tree on the sea front had limbs hanging limply, or torn completely off.  The bad weather has all but cleared up now, leaving a few less trees, a very windswept looking beach, and a much cooler region; it feels like the storm blew out the summer and has heralded the beginning of the clear, cooler Autumn days."
330,"Earlier in the afternoon, I had been chatting with an Irish couple who had been here two days. On each day, they both had problems with their hired bikes. THe problems were the hotel's fault, so they had been a little hassled, but Ronnie said to me in the afternoon that it was no big deal, the little things that go wrong make a holiday interesting. And here I am, in the hotel foyer, by the bar, and there is a huge commotion. A crowd of people are attending someone, fussing around, and running around with cloths and ice packs. That's odd. I look for another moment, and there's actually two people being attended to. Five minutes before I arrived, Ronnie had been standing chatting at the bar when he just keeled over, forwards, falling face first onto the tiled floor. Blood everywhere, four teeth smashed, broken nose and exploded bottom lip. He was down for about half a minute, which was plenty time for a massive puddle of blood to form.  He was helped up as he came round, and the sight of his smashed face then caused Malcolm, who was sat at the bar, to faint. He fell BACK off his chair, and smashed his head open. Ronnie goes off to hospital for 20 stitches, and Malcolm recovers okay. All the while outside the resort is being blown down to Southern Italy. When I get to speak to Ronnie the next morning, he's in good humour, but he looks a right old mess. And will be spending the rest of the holiday eating soup. It was a case of too much sun, he says. It happened to him before 10 years ago, but that time he fell sidewards and all was fine."
331,"Granted, it's not the world's toughest job, but it is sometimes intense.  But once you finish, that's it. And in a town you don't know, with no ""friends"" to see, no cinema to visit, no tv to watch, no theatre, not much of anything else to do at all, it is liberating to live a simple life of reading, be it on the beach, or on the balcony. Or, if not reading, just go for a walk, head empty, calmly following whatever road you wander down. It seems a long way from the frantic life I normally lead - in Oxford, surrounded by options, I do too much, and keep myself too busy, beating myself up about the things I don't get to do. But it seems that if I remove the options and make my life simpler, things are a great deal calmer. What does this mean? Is it time to get out of the city, and get somewhere simple? Who knows?"
332,"Things are beginning to repeat themselves now, and things that I once regarded as special occassions are becoming the norm. Once this happens, it becomes harder to relate to the guests' experience. Once a week we do the ""Night of Stars"". The hotel garden is decorated with stars everywhere, special tables are laid, all with candles, the food and wine are special, and Paolo comes and plays some great lounge music. It's a magical evening, relaxing, indulgent, and really special. But I've now done it four times. It sounds crazy, but it has now become just another night. The normal dinners, too, are amazing. The guests continually praise the food. All the meals are incredible, varied, and lovingly presented. But I've eaten it all now, and it's just food.  I've even noticed this in the riding - I can't share the rider's awe in the views in the same way. I still adore the riding round here, but it is no longer the novelty of the view that appeals, but the return to favourite places. I can now choose routes according to my favourite places, and share this wonderful region with the guests. It is down to me to show them the beauty, and this familiarity is the most rewarding. Maybe I will tire of the food, the crazy games that Mazzio plays in the evenings, the beach, the tasty afternoon biker's buffet. Somehow I don't think I will tire of the riding though - however familiar that gets, it will still be stunning."
333,"Crazy day today - Today was a great ride, up some lovely hills. We all got back, it got really windy. And then it got REALLY windy. And then trees started falling on the road. And then MORE treees started falling into cars. And then furniture started rolling down the street. Then the heavens opened. Then one guy fainted in the bar (maybe because it is obscenely humid), fell straight forward, broke nose, lost two teeth, smashed up his face, and created a lake of blood on the floor of the bar. Two minutes later another guy fainted at the sight of the blood, fell off his bar stool and cracked his head open. Meanwhile there were people stranded on the mountains in the wind who we couldn't go pick up because of the crisis in the hotel. Meanwhile The Americans continued to ask us inane irrelevant demanding questions. It's great. Oh, and for two days running, i have been just about to leave the hotel when three people come to all claiming to own the same bike. cue frantic bike finding, changing over, and general pain in the arseness while 20 (yes, 20) riders wait for me to lead them on ride. It's great. Oh, and the rep from Fondriest (a posh Italian roadie company) just came to the hotel, and brought out some new carbon frame. You should have seen everyone swarm to it. It drew a huge crowd. Everyone did the ""I am an expert, and if i hold, flick and stroke this item I will be able to judge its quality and appreciate how much faster it will make me ride even though I am old overweight and unfit"" action."
334,"The descents are good, too, not too twisty, but steep enough for some entertaining speed, and with crisp views of the coastline dead ahead. Urbino is lovely, its buildings are as gorgeous as Florence, but instead of hoardes of tourists, there are hoardes of beautiful students.  And the group was great - riding together, with no real waiting for anyone, no bike problems, just a disciplined set of experienced riders who knew how to ride in a group. Why then did it feel like a really dull day? This should have been a euphoric day for me - no challenges, familiar roads, views to die for. But it felt like a day of work, nothing more. I started the ride feeling less than 100%, which was maybe reponsible, but it surely was something more. Is this the stage where turning one's passion into employment changes the status of the passion? Have I reached a stage where the passion is becoming a duty, and therefore less enjoyable? Is this me discovering that guiding isn't a sensible career move?  Actually, I already know guiding isn't a sensible career move; this has been, and is, a wonderful experience, but it is certainly something not to be done forever!"
335,"Why is every single thriller I read so disappointing, formulaic, and absurd? For the first three hundred pages of this one a serial killer makes his way through a bunch of murders, all of which are exquisitely described, in loving, gory detail. Oh, how much ""glistening"" blood there is, how many ""stark faces of terror"" there are, and lots of ""tastes of bile"" as the police investigate. All the while, there is much thrashing of minds by the troubled detective, as he wrestles with the case, and we learn about his, yawn, troubled background.  But that's it. For three hundred pages it is a straight line plot. For the next two hundred pages, well, things start to develop, but it's as usual with a thriller. A few good clues are found, and some good deductions are made, before, ultimately, in an oh-so-never-heard-this-one-before one hundred page climax, the plot twists and turns, and, would you Adam-and-Eve it, it's all been perpetrated by one of the cops. Like I couldn't see that coming. It's always the same. Thrillers promise a good escape, but deliver the same dull predictable formula every time. Why are some people so dull as to read these things without question? Oh, today's ride was quite nice too. Up and over some hills. Nice coffee. Few more hills. Siesta."
336,"The beach party is, obviously, down at the beach, with DJ, lots of decoration, and all the staff dressed in bright red tops. The first thing to happen is that all the guests are given a tequila slammer. This is for ALL the guests, even those in their 60s or 70s. The party started at 5.30 so everyone's lubricated pretty instantly. Liam (the younger guide) and I are sat at the table mostly with the Single English Men, those who've come out on their own. This week, it's an odd bunch, but not too bad. There is one spare seat, and once we have all sat down, here comes a female. And, wow, she got the air of confidence about her - somewhere in her late 30s, she's hanging on to what's left of her obviously once great looks, and on a table of 30 and 40- somethings, she looks great. Suddenly, all The Single English Men change noticeably, becoming charming, or at least attempting to be. The new arrival is Pauline, from London, who has been a chef here in the past, but is out here for a holiday. Within 2 minutes, somehow Ken, from Abingdon, has revelaed he is single, with an uncontrollable excitement. The meal progresses, and at some stage I slip into a trance, and zone out for a while. Only to be brought back to the conversation by the line ""But, you know, the best thing about Abingdon is its supermarkets."" What? Ken, Abingdon born and bred, somehow got chatting about his home town, and this was the best he could come up with to dazzle the table with. ""It's amazing, the Tescos in Abingdon is enormous. And it's open 24 hours a day, you know. There's lots of other ones, and I really like going there late at night."" He'd already revealed his insomnia during this holiday, caused by getting the midnight munchies and eating six, yes, six, Powerbars. Powerbars are energy food to be eaten during exercise. Not as a midnight snack. And certainly not six. I dread to think what his intestines were like after that feast. But, back to the conversation. While most of our jaws dropped in shock at these fascinating facts about Abingodn, Ken continued on with his favourite exploits. He relished going into Tescos and ""listening for the 'click-click-click."" This was accompanied by him gesturing to us as if holding a small pistol. I was getting worried. ""It's the click-click-click"" - more gesturing - ""of the cheap food woman. I love listening out for her and getting the 3am bargains."" Well, this is all fair enough, but the relish with which this was all being recounted was just slightly disturbing. I was beginning to wonder how surreal things could get, and within five minutes Ken was on about his habit of walking down George st and sharing bottles of Vodka with the tramps.  At which stage things went from being amusing to, well, a little bit sad, really. He kept on revealing things that really shouldn't be revealed around a dinner table. Very very strange.  Once focus left Ken, it all fell back on Pauline, who was holding her own masterfully amongst the preying eyes of the Single Men.  I had to take a break from the party to come write this, it's certainly the oddest evening I have had here in Riccione. Today's bike ride - amazing. Perfect, hot, weather, with stunning views atop a killer climb; my group were in pieces at the top, but they all loved it. Although I lost one rider early on, which was a complete screw up on my behalf. Fortunately, once he realised I had gone past a junction without waiting, he did end up finding his own nice route, so I haven't gotten the sack just yet..."
337,"A row of the female staff along one side, and the male along the other. By now, it's dark, and there is a golden, full moon hanging over the calm sea. On comes the music, and there I am, dancing for the guests.  Now, this began a pretty strange evening for me. Every time there is a party in the hotel, Martzio leads some daft dancing, and the staff follow along. I have no problem with this, if I look a fool, I don't care, I always figured that so long as you are having fun, then any misdirection is perfectly excusable. And here I am, like some pole dancer, spotlit, alongside Martzio, a couple of the others, and opposite the girls. And, good god, I loved it. Dancing to any old daft disco tune, including an obligatory camp YMCA dance, it was bloody great fun. There is some rush to being on stage, having a great time, and people cheering you on. All one has to do is do some silly dance move and it gets a cheer. Obviously, people could be laughing at me, but I don't think so, it was all genuine.  Martzio pushed it a little bit far, and we ended up beginning a Full MOnty routine, but fortunately that stopped at the tops. But, yes, I did dance, on a beach hut roof, under a full moon, in front of about 100 guests, with no top on. What would my bosses at the old office job think? Following on from that, there was plenty of dancing on the beach with the guests, and Marina also asked me to do the speeches during the evening and at the end, encouraging people to dance, telling them the programme for the night, thanking everyone at the end, etc. And it came so easy to me.  Conclusion? What job could encapsulate the confidence I have in standing up in front of people like this? I've always been a bit of a show-off, in what I would like to think is a modest way - if that's not a contradiction. Last night was amazing, and it felt incredible to see people having a great time, and to know that I contributed to their enjoyment in a definite way."
338,"How interesting do they think talking about gear ratioes can be? For those who don't know what I mean, the number of teeth on the cogs on the wheel and at your cranks are the single most important thing in the universe. Whether you have 11 or 12 teeth on the smallest sprocket at the back makes the difference between a good ride or a bad. And whoever has the most teeth on the big ring at the pedal-end of the bike is the most macho of them all.  The trick is to let someone rabbit on about their 53-11 ratio that they do time trials on - stick with me, this is interesting, honestly - and then slyly let slip that you ride with a 54-11 (that's a harder gear), thus proving your superior place in the  hierarchy of man. Once you have established that you are harders than the others, you can then spout on about what the correct ratio for any given hill in the UK is. ""You go up The Cat and Fiddle on a 28-16? But that's not the right gear at all."" On and on can this conversation go. And when one set of customers leave, another set arrive, all with their own fresh, original, I've-never-heard-it-before opinions about the world of ratioes. You would think that this kind of thing had been established, and didn't need to be talked about, but now, everyone has an opinion."
339,"1. The Amoeba This group would be largely made up of Germans, with some strong English riders. Everyone is too polite to dare ride in front of me, but they are all slightly competitive, so they try to ride as close to me as possible. I will be happily spinning along, only to glance behind me to see a mass of cyclists, three or four abreast, right on my tail. A truck passing when we are in this shape would be bad... 2. The chatty types Everyone wants to chat to the guide. Personally, I only like riding two abreast on quiet roads. But some guests seem to need to talk to me on the busiests of roads. Today, one old guy insisted on riding alongside me on some of the busiest roads in the region, chatting about Armoured Vehicle Electronics as double-trailered HGVs rumble past. He also rode scarily close to me, which made me feel pretty claustrophobic - I was pinned to the edge of the tarmac, and he never budged to the centre of the road if I had to avoid some debris. 3. The disintegration This is a group of beginners. Riding along in a group, the most efficient way to ride is in a line, very close to the rider's wheel in front of you. It takes some experience to do this, because you have to trust the person in front of you - 20 mph and only a few inches to the wheel in front can be scary. Beginners don't get it, and along I ride on a flat road for a while, only to turn round and find me group dotted along the highway, none of them getting any benefit from drafting, and requiring lots of stopping and starting at junctions to ensure everyone makes the right turns. 4. The Perfect. When it all comes together, everyone rides close to each other, everyone shares a turn at the front, dropping off to the back in a steady rhythm. There's no talking, just the swishing off chains rushing through the derailleurs, and in this way, great distances can be covered very quickly. This is the one part of road riding that beats mountain biking hands-down. It's a great feeeling of team work, is surprisingly less hard than it sounds, but feels excellent. 5. The racers They want to beat the guide. Fair enough, they probably all can, but it splinters the group, and makes life a tad hard for me - I have to ensure people at the back are ok, but at the same time be near enough at the front to make sure no turnings are missed. This group requires me to slow down, then sprint repeatedly as I move from front to back. A great work out, but a pain in the arse, and I'm knackered at the end of one of these days."
340,"And what a blast. It's also the day we go to Spadarolo, Merina's home, for a BBQ in her garden, so there's pressure on to get to her place for 1 o'clock. And off we go, myself and 8 riders, up the ""easy"" Cerasolo climb (10% for 1km), back down into the next valley before a cracking 10km stretch up to Verruchio. Moderately steep but easy to get a good rhythm on. All the way, the view of San Marino dominates - a towering republic, the oldest in the world, apparently. It sits high atop a mountain with a cliff on one side, and a steep climb up on the other. From all over the region its visible, and wildly different from each angle. A brief banana break at the cobbled square in Verucchio, and then down into the third valley. But not before looking right to a truly stunning view of the northern Romagna landscape - all limestone towers, thrust up out of the fields, sheer-sided, many with forts churches or castles on top. It's wonderful. Into the valley, and then as a tight unit, the group of us hurtle 10km on the main road up the valley, everyone taking their turn at the front. We cover the distance in no time, and we find ourselves at the base of another ridge to be conquered. This one takes us to Passo de Grillo. Everyone's a little fired up after the road team work, so the pace up here is fast, and it's a long long climb. Eventually to the top, with more views to die for - why did I forget to take my camera today? And then a wickedly fast and twisty descent for a few km, before a monstrous 30km, mostly flat, but slightly descending, ride to Santarcangelo (photo here: http://www.emmeti.it/Welcome/Emilia/ProvRimini/Arcangelo/index.it.html) All the way it's another great bit of team work, and we reach the BBQ having averaged 26kph for the day. After a full lunch in the sunshine, it's another blast home to complete the 100km, and we maintain the fast average.  On a day like this, you couldn't ask for more.
"
341,"Hot right from the start, I have a tiny group of three riders. In store is a pretty short ride, but with some stiff hills. After an hour of flat riding into the valleys, up we go, and immediately it's a climb to test the riders. I love this kind of stuff, and get up it okay, sweating freely.  The others make it pretty well, too. Lots of huffing and puffing. The view from the first summit is both wonderful and a little depressing. The coffee stop is Gemmano, and it is visible in the distance, a bright white church atop a conical hill. Between us and the hill is another deep valley - the next half hour of pain is apparent; a rapid descent, and then 5 km of more savage slopes. But, we get to Gemmano, have our coffee, and enjoy the 360 degree views. From here, I ask the group if they want to head home, or over to Montefiore Conca. It's only 10km as the crow flies, but the crow has a big advantage. Montefiore is about the same height as Gemmano, but the valley between pretty much reaches sea level before beginning the rise back to 400m. Happily they seem keen to give it a go. I haven't told them that it's all at least a 10% slope, a maximum of 20% for a couple of stretches. I haven't ridden it myself before, but the other guides have warned me it's one of the steepest climbs in the area. We descend from Gemmano, and every hairpin provides a glimpse of Montefiore. Depresseingly, we are descending, and each time we see it, it's higher.  The climb has no break-in phase, it's brutal from the get go. With such a small group, I can afford to ride this at my pace, so off I race, relishing the chance to hammer a hill. It's so tough, but this is my favourite kind of thing. We make it to the top, all happy, and all of us are genuinely amazed - making the climb is an acheivement in itself, but the fortress and town at the top are beyond any of the ones I have seen in the region so far. The views blow me away, the distant coastline dappled with spots of sun breaking through the partial cloud cover. Gemmano across the valley sits proud, and we can see the valley floor between us and Gemmano and enjoy the climb we've just made.  It's also nice for me to see this place for the first time, I can share the guests' enjoyment in the same way. From there, it's a great fast descent and cruise home. Another magic day, it's still a great job!"
342,"When I came to the hotel last night after my siesta, I was amazed to discover the hotel is as full as it has been all month - lots of late bookings, and we have a busy busy week. Ho hum, so much for the relaxed ending. The traditional Sunday ride is along ""The Panoramica"", a coastal road up and over the headlands south of Riccione. Everyone sets off together for the first, flat 10km, and then at the top of the first, pretty gentle climb, we split into the three groups for the day. It's always a pretty comical experience for the guides. At the start of the ride, there's plenty of nervous people, worried about where they will be in the groups. And there's plenty of people who really look like they maybe shouldn't be here. All comes clear on the first climb. We ride slowly up until there, so that the whole group starts it together, and within 500m the group is splintered completely. The immediacy of the splintering is always incredible to see, but it does make splitting the groups up very easy. Today, I'm with the short group, which involves a couple of biggish climbs, then a long sweet descent and a stiff climb to the lovely castle atop Gadara. All is going well, ie slowly, and we get to the bottom of the big climb to Gradara when one of the women in the group realises she left her helmet at the top of the second climb, 10km behind us.  Hmmm.  On the ond hand this is bad.  But on the other, it's great. I tell the group to find their own way to the top of Gradara, and I get to sprint back to where we stopped in Fiorenzola. What a blast, a 'mare of a climb, ridden at full pace, and then a whizzing descent, before pushing hard to the cafe stop in Gradara. Riding at my pace for 45min on a day I would normally be crawling along at. I find my group, they're all happy. I'm happy for the extra bonus ride. And home we wend after that, cruising through the ghost town that are the resorts of Cattolica and Riccione. Almost all the hotels are closed for the season now, as are most shops. It's only the few cycling hotels that are open now, so maybe 15 hotels out of about 2000. The streets are eerily quiet, it's like there has been a panic evacuation.
"
343,"Got up, bought an English paper, found a cafe, and sat outside, next to a singing pavement box. Riccione is brilliant for this - all along the promenade streets - there are many of them, coz these Italians love to stroll up and down, looking stylish and glamorous - there are little boxes, or balls, or other wierd shapes containing speakers, that play cheesy listening tunes for you as you wander along. They're harmless and make the strolling around really relaxed. One of my favourite ways home on the bike rides is to bring the group along one of these, slowing down as we pass the singing pavements, and the fountains, and the beach. Well, whoever works out the playlist clearly put Queen's Greatest Hits into the mix so for an hour I got to hear lots of Queen. Now, it's a bit embarassing in 2004 to admit that they're one of your favourite bands, but, there, I've said it, however uncool it is, they rock! [I would like to point out to people who don't know me, that I *do* like many more bands, don't just think I'm some saddo 80s hanger on who never let go of Queen, Bon Jovi, Whitesnake, etc. I have heard of the Shins, the White Stripes, PJ Harvey, etc!] It made for a great morning, anyway, and after that, some time on the beach, dozing in the warm October sunshine made for a good day. Tomorrow - 160km of hills. I can't wait!"
344,"In fact, it's actually just the wife, a woman who looks like she has done a DIY face lift, with her skin sretched, and eyebrows permanently arched high, looking like some surprised little gerbil. And her voice. Oh, her voice, it is like the sound of knives being sharpened.  And her attitude. Oh, her attitude. So far, I don't think anything has made her happy. Our restuarant is ""like a works canteen"" and anyway ""I asked to eat outside every night, and her I am inside."" Erm, it was cold last night, and Marina, very very happily, put the two of them outside, on their own, this evening. Everything we offer ""isn't as good as when we went to Corsica/Portugal/Spain/Provence/Majorca."" Although, whenever she actually talks about those places they only seem to tell us the bad things. ""Portugal was the worst food I have ever eaten.""  (By the way, whenever you read any of her dialogue, read it as if it is a screech that would make your pet dog panic) Her bike doesn't have a triple chainring, which she asked for (a triple chainring theoretically gives you easier gears for climbing). Instead, we gave her a bike with a double chainring that has an easier granny gear than our bikes with the triples, so she DOES actually have an easier bike for climbing with. But, oh no, she asked for a triple, so she wants one. We gave her one. Ah, but that's too big.  Tomorrow, the group rides are starting early because we have a special lunch in Furlo gorge. ""Oh, it's good to see you do sometimes bother starting early. When we were in [insert random location] we started at six am.""  Well bloody get up at six am you stupid woman and go for a 200km ride even though it does not get light until 7.30 and even then it's chilly until about 8.30 and you're the only person daft enough to bother starting so early and while you're out there use the bloody map that i made specially for you to guide you where you want to go and then you said it wasn't good enough although it's a photocopy of the best map you can buy of the region but no it is still not right for you what the hell do you want from us and if you get lost while you are riding on your own you will still probably find fault in the hotel and make it our fault and anyway next time you should just go back to Corsica or wherever it is that is better than here I would love to see it because I cannot imagine anywhere being better than Belvedere but somehow you seem to love complaining and you have obviously done it so much your voice box has worn out from whining that much and your face has disfigured from pulling that ""ooh it's not quite right in here"" and your husband has become so quiet and submissive after years and years of this I don't know how he survived it. And.... relax. I feel much better now. I don't think I should give her the address of this journal sight when she leaves, do you?
"
345,"From there, it's a climb into a furnace as we ascend through the midday sun to Acqualagna, and then have a scarily fast, wide descent to Furlo gorge. Avid readers may remember Furlo gorge from two weeks ago. Then, it was the complete arse up of a day that saw me in a car park all morning, and fuming at the crazy Italian organisation. Today, I am a happy bunny as the group amble through this incredible 600m deep canyon with its bottle green river wending its way through it. A feast of a lunch awaits us, and it's PROPER food - some of the best food I have eaten for a long while. The red wine is like nectar, but it requires all my professional attitude not to sit there and sink a bottle; i have to make do with one glass. Even so, it's a heavy Andy that gets on the bike to lead a small group of intrepid riders on the hilly 80km route home. I've not done this particular route, but yet again, it's a voyage of wonder, and joy. The sun is masked by a haze that, through my pink sunglass lenses, render the day in a permanent evening sunset light. The haze prevents us from seeing too far, but as we climb, we are treated to ridge after ridge washed in yellow light, each successive ridge a lighter tone. On and on, and up and down, we go, into and over remote valleys, passing yet more amazing hilltop churches. Eventually, the sun gets low, and we have to get our skates on. We don't get back to the hotel until 6.45pm, having left at 8.30am. Normally we would return at 3pm, but the lunch makes this a long day.  Everyone is very happy though, riding in the evening allows us to see this beautiful landscape in a completely different light, one that enhances it.  And not only that, the distance has been brilliant, a chance to race and gobble up the miles.
"
346,"Today, I just feel a little out of words to add to what I have already described of this place!"
347,"The climbs are getting longer, I am pushing up them much faster, and relishing in it. The long group is really capable this week, so we are covering some pretty hefty distances at a great pace. And in terms of people watching this week, even Dragon Ladt turns out to be pretty funny. Get past her screechy voice, and there's someone in there who really doesn't give a monkey's what you think of her, she's just out to say her mind and have a good time. So, first impressions were kind of right, but it turns out that if you don't let it get to you you can enjoy any person and any character."
348,"Firstly, this is a dream job. It may not pay well, but it's utterly fantastic. Getting paid to ride a bike a have a laugh with people? What could be better?  This hotel is fantastic, and I would recommend anyone who has ever thought of coming out to Italy to ride, come to the Belvedere. (www.belvederericcione.com) The riding is excellent, but the passion, the food and the service is beyond anything I have ever seen. Diplomacy is a great skill. I have learnt how to appear happy and pleased whatever the circumstance. Even if someone is doing my head in, it is not for me professionally to have an opinion of them. Being able to maintain the happy facade is very useful. And for almost all those moments in this journal where i may have slagged people off, it's really only a chance to let off steam. There is good stuff to say about everyone I have met. Even if their questions can be inane, their actions irritating, or their demands unreasonable. I prefer mountain bikes to road bikes. The road riding is wonderful, but I still miss the fat tyre experience. I am tired. The pace is pretty relentless -  get up, eat, ride, siesta, eat, sleep. Throw in there the odd excessive night of drinking, take out a siesta or two, put in a bit of stress with dealing with crazy customers, and it's a tough old job.  Managing a big group of mismatched riders is particularly difficult. You have to stop the fast riders shooting past the junctions while at the same time ensuring the slower ones see where the rest of the riders are going. On the hills, the waits at the top can be eternal, and on the flats, you have to slow the pace right down to keep everyone together, pissing off the faster riders. Assertiveness has become easier!"
349,"It is kind of sad to be finsihing, but my body has crashed in the last day or so. All week I have been racing up the hills, and yesterday in particular was a complete race, with a nice sprint finish along the sea front to destroy us once and for all. For the last couple of days, the siesta has been an instant plummet into the depths of sleep, from which it has been extremely difficult to rouse oneself for dinner.  On today's ride, I only had two riders, both pretty cruisy riders so we didn't do anything tough or fast, but I still felt myself labouring up the hills.  It is probably all the fault of the sprint yesterday - going from aerobic to anaerobic power is something I have done very rarely on this trip. You send the message to all the muscles to work flat out, and for a while, all is good. But then they start to tire, and yet you must keep going. Everything begins to burn, and ultimately, each fibre becomes its own personality, every one screaming at the brain to stop this bloody effort. But still you keep going. The next thing to go is the control of the face muscles, as a very unattractive grimace spreads wide. But you can't breathe any other way, and the pain forces this ugly face out. Eventually you reach the line (I won! At over 32mph, too!). And then everything goes wobbly for a while.  For this two minute effort, it takes a full day off to really recover. Crazy, no? Oh, and instead of it getting colder as we reach winter, it's getting hotter and hotter. Right now, it's evening, and stinkingly humid. Ugh. But the weather is supposed to break tomorrow..."
350,"Off we went. Gentle climb, easy descent, flat section. And then the climb to Montefiore Conca. Three kilometres, 15% gradient, lots of nasty hairpins. Ow, it hurt. I made it up there in the middle ring, utterly knackered. Only one of the others managed to ride it. One of my favourite climbs.  From there, more down, lots more up, more down, and then lots more up. A total of 1500m climbing, ridden hard and fast. I emptied the legs for the last day. In the last 15km, it rained hard. This was a good thing in a way, it was Italy telling me it is time to get home to the rain and winter in the UK.  Fair enough, it's been a year of riding, with a mere 8 weeks of work (not including this guiding job). Not bad for a 32 yr old."
351,"In the last two nights Marina has thrown parties for the guides and the staff. On Saturday night we had a meal in the garden of her house for the guides and a few others.  Champagne, fondue, pasta, wine (amazing wine), more amazing wine. Some more incredible food. Oh, this is all outdoors in a candle light garden. Grappa. Then grapes in spirits. Coffee. INcredible. That was the warm up night. Last night was the big one, the hotel closed, and all the staff are out on a mystery tour. Basically, 30 of us got on a bus to go to a restaurant in Forli, about an hour's drive north. And there, the food was equally amazing. Possibly the best pizzas I have ever had, 2ft in diameter, with the thinnest, crispiest crust I have ever seen. Any thinner and it would not have been there at all. Accompanied by more wonderful wine and beer.  It's amazing. Marina comes up with so many amazing ideas, for the guests and the staff. And tirelessly she makes plans to keep people happy. I guess this is the end then. Right now, Ihave to go to the airport and fly home. I am sure I could wax lyrical and write something profound, but with only ten minutes to go I will have to keep it in my head.  The future? Well, this last five weeks has been a magic networking opportunity. I have got at least one good work opportunity from this, which is excellent, and a good few leads on the world of journalism. With a bit of work, there is definitely a suite of articles about guiding that can be written.
"
352,"Thanks for everyone who signed the guestbook - your comments have been entertaining. And thanks for sharing in my rants about guests. Almost always, even the most exasperating of guests are still fun, great people, and this journal has been a brilliant way of letting off steam. There are countless more inane little anecdotes that never made it here (ask me about Japanese tyres...). My next journal? Yikes, who knows. More guiding. Touring the alps. Poland. Spain. Scotland. Ireland. Oh man, there is the whole world to explore."
353,"Welcome to my online journal. At the moment, I'm less than two weeks away from leaving Boise, ID and travelling to Seattle, WA by bike. It's a bit crazy because for the last two weeks, I've been very busy with work and haven't been able to do as much planning and preparation and I had liked. But with that mostly out of the way, I get a couple of days off soon where I can take care of everything. Whee!!! And, I just went out and bought my BOB Yak trailer this morning!!! Whee!!!!! I was so happy; first because I've always wanted a trailer of some sorts and second, because that means to me that I AM going. I should mention that for this summer, since the middle of May, I've been in Boise, ID as the sound intern for the Idaho Shakespeare Festival (http://www.idahoshakespeare.org). It's been a great summer and I've been biking everywhere, which is partly how this trip came about. And if you're in Boise in September, check out ""The Fantasticks"". I've been slowly telling friends and co-workers about my trip. Their reactions fall into either of two categories: 1) ""Wow, cool! Have Fun!"" or 2) ""You're doing what!? Are you crazy?! Are you...?!?! Don't you?!?!?"". Someone turned to me and said ""Bullsh#t"". I repeated again that I wasn't joking. (Note from 2004: This same person was one of the first to ask if I was going to take another trip this year) I guess I'm at the point where I let the world know why I'm biking home to Seattle when (taking into account the cost of the trailer, other gear and shipping my extraneous stuff home) it would be cheaper to fly or even take Greyhound. So here goes. First, I've always wanted to take another bike trip. I've gone on a few before with a scout troop many years ago, another with a church group and even did the Seattle To Portland (STP) in 1997 (Yes, the one where it rained all day). The difference between then and now is that those were all sagged, with big groups and had other people planning the route. I'm going solo with all my stuff in my trailer. Once I get home, I'll try and find my notes for those trips because they were a blast! One was around Puget Sound starting in Seattle, heading up to Port Angeles, to Victoria, BC to Anacortes, over Deception Pass and back down into Seattle. Another was a trip around Lopez and San Juan islands in the San Juan Islands. The other trip was down the Oregon Coast on Highway 101. All three were very memorable and fun, some of the best trips I've gone on. Second, I have to get me and my bike back to Seattle somehow. So I figured I might as well ride considering reason #1. Third, the ""call of the wild"", ""go west young man"", dang I haven't been camping in a while. I probably have some more, but I'll add them later when I think about them. So there's the basics. I'll be adding a few more pages before I leave and hopefully be able to update from the road. As I have no laptop or digital camera, I'll be writing stuff down in a notebook and posting text and pictures when I can. -Tim"
354,"Start: Boise, ID  Finish: Seattle, WA Duration: 10-13 days, averaging 40-60 miles per day Solo tour The Plan The plan as it stands is to head west into Oregon. I'll follow the TransAmerica Trail (from Adventure Cycling) until I get near Pendelton, OR. I will then cut north and into Washington. From there I plan to go across Snoqualmie Pass (I-90). Once back in Western Washington, I'll head up the Eastside (of Lake Washington) and hopefully visit some relatives and my brother before heading into Seattle. As an alternate, instead of Snoqualmie, I head up to Stevens Pass (highway 2 or 20, I don't remember at the moment) and cross the Cascades that way. If I do that, I hope to stay with some other relatives in Leavenworth before heading over the pass. I've seen bikes on this pass and it's classified as a highway so I might be going this way. I have a query out to a Seattle bike club about the best way to travel that bit so I'm waiting to see what they say. Rejected Routes If I were to take another week, I'd cycle up to Sandpoint, ID and pickup the Northern Tier trail but that would add another week to my trip. If my brother and his wife were still living in Portland, OR, I'd go west to Portland and then north to Seattle. More Stuff That's the route as it stands now. As I research stuff, I'll have a better idea. And yes, I know all the touring books said I should be doing this 4 weeks ago. ;-) -Tim The Actual Route - editorial content from 2004 West from Boise on US 26 to Mt. Vernon, OR. North on US 395 to Pendleton, OR. Across the Columbia to Prosser, WA on I-82, US 14 and US 221. To Yakima, WA on US 22, through the Yakima River Canyon (821) to Ellensburg, WA. US 97 & US 2 to Leavenworth, WA and US 2 to Monroe, WA. Various roads and highways from Monroe, WA to Seattle, WA (please see Day 13)."

I get a lot of ""What if...?""."
356,"And it also just hit me that not only do I have a week until I leave, but I'm only here at the Festival for another week and then the main season is over. Time flies when you're having fun. The other day (Friday) I was out shopping near Boise Towne Square. I stopped at the Barnes and Noble (they have the bad bike racks that barely hold your wheel, almost necesitating a cable lock) for maps and stuff. I walked out of there about quarter after four and looked at the sky. Big, black thunder clouds stretched as far as I could see. So as I hurry down the road to REI, I feel a couple raindrops. Then while I'm in REI, the sky opens up and pours. Being from Seattle, I'm quite used to rain, so when I say it pours, it POURS. With my raingear at the theatre, I decided to ""shop"" for a while more while the storm blew over. About 6pm, I decide to go home, rain and all (though it let up quite a bit). The picture of me must've been interesting: A guy in black on a bike with a trailer with a gallon of white gas strapped to it, riding in the rain. As I'm climbing up the I-184 overpass on Emerald, this truck beeps at me. I didn't know why it was beeping. It turns out to be one of my friends from work who offered me a ride. Kudos to Dante! It turns out that this storm caused quite a few mudslides/road closures, power outages and a lot of other nasty stuff. It made me glad I had the night off. Today I've been looking up the status of wildfires in WA, OR and ID. Even with that one fire agency's website, you still have to look on other websites and I think it's just a mess. As far as I can tell, my route is in the clear. Adventure Cycling says part of the TransAm route is affected but they just give you a link to that fire agency and let you try and figure it out. It's just frustrating. Well, time to spend more money I don't have. ;-) -Tim"
357,"I would also like to give a quick shoutout to Georges Cycles (http://www.georgescycles.com/). I took my bike in for a $30 inspection & tune (or whatever they call it). I had setup to have it worked on on Tuesday. I roll it in at 9am when they opened (Front St. location), walked over to WinCo Foods and walked around for a while, walked home and was nearly home (shortly after 10am) and my bike was done! I was happy because I was planning to be without my bike for the whole day. I went looking at shoes and pedals and though they didn't have my size, their store on State street did. So today I went out there and ended up getting a different shoe than what I was orignally going to get. I then rode out of there with clipless pedals, which I had been telling myself the past 3 years that I was eventually going to get. What a difference than running shoes and hiking boots! I went with Specialized shoes (with a SPD cleat) and a set of mountain pedals (for the dual-sided entry). Now I'm just waiting for the ""Clipless Pedal Right-of-Passage"" (stopping and forgetting to un-clip). While I'm on the shoutouts bit, a quick one to World Cycle in Boise (http://www.worldcycleboise.com/) where I got my B.O.B. Yak. I went in there the other day and the guy working asked how my trailer was. Cool. Time to go do some more riding! -Tim"
358,"So anyway, the room is a big pile of camping gear, bike gear, a whole summer in Boise gear, bike, trailer and a few other odds and ends. All I need now is the kitchen sink. I'm in the middle of gathering (haven't started packing) and I think/hope I have everything. I'll post pictures when I get home. I'm also got some new tires, Specialized Nimbus Armadillos (700x28C). Now, if they were only Specialized Nimbus 2000 Armadillos, I could pull out my wand, levitate my trailer and fly up the mountain passes. Umm... let's just say I've caught up with everybody at work on the Harry Potter series. They seem to ride quite nicely so far. I'm at the point where one moment I ask myself ""am I really doing this?"" and at the next ""Whee! Let's get out of here!"" and the next ""I'm stuck in the middle of my room surrounded by stuff and I can't get out! Help!"" Is this common? ;-) I'm planning on leaving Boise at 10am Monday, after a stop at the Park Center location of Zeppole Baking Co. Gotta have that bread and cheese! ;-) And the brownie! Unfortunately for me, the downtown location is closed on Monday. But if you ever get to Boise, look this place up. If they weren't around, I think I would've starved this summer. This will probably be my last update before I hit the road. [warning sound cue 1] The next update will be from the road somewhere, probably around Pendleton.  [sound 1... GO] (""Homeward Bound"" by Simon & Garfunkel, of course) Adios! Tim P.S. - And just for Chris, [foot dip... GO] ;-)

359,"The Data: Miles: 67.39Time: 5:23:26 (7+ hours)Max Speed: 29.3 mphAvg Speed: 12.4 mph The Route: Home to the Greenbelt, Greenbelt over to State St. (somewhere around Lakeview Estates), State St. (aka 44) until JCT with Old Highway 30, left on OH 30, right onto US 20/26, follow until Nyssa, OR, at the 20/26 and 201 JCT follow 201 (straight), left on SW 18th Ave (light), right on Clark Blvd., left on Sugar Ave, campground is about 1/2 mile down on the right, big sign with a 5-10 minute walk down a dirt/big gravel road, watch out for the underpass when you enter Nyssa as it has big gaps in the expansion joints The Gory Details: Today was quite crazy. I was up early hoping for a 10am start. As 10am came and went, I was hoping for a September 1 start. I spent my time doing a final packing of all my stuff on the bike, packing all my stuff for home, cleaning my room and all that fun stuff. I finally got on the road around 11-11:30am. It is much different travelling with a loaded trailer. It almost makes it hard to control the bike. Before I could get on the road, I had to stopped at the library, post office and at a place by the Boise River to dip my front tire into. As I'm heading out, I pass under I-84 (or is it 184?). Heading westbound on the Greenbelt, it's the double-span bridge before you hit the ""rough section ahead"". A father and son on a cruiser style tandem have a nicely flat rear tire. As I switch my pump around to help them, I think I break it but discover it's meant to come apart like it did. Big sigh of relief! As I got near the Wal-Mart on 44, I see these two cyclists on the side of the road. They are husband and wife (I'm assuming) and have bicycled from New York City over the past 3 months and are heading to the ocean. They say they've had many flats in Idaho and are temped to stay another day in the city to wait for a bike shop to open to get their tubes slimed. I wished them luck and headed on my way. I had lunch in Middleton in the city park where you stepped in the grass and hundreds of mosquitos swarmed up. Before I knew it, I had about 20 bites on my legs. It was not fun. When I went through Star, they were having a big Labor Day celebration including a TRACTOR PULL!!! I almost stuck around for a while but wanted to make time. And what day wouldn't be complete without a Fast Eddy? Outside of Parma, I was going up a hill (of course) and this dog started barking and running over to the fence. And it just kept on running. So I pedaled faster and he eventually gave up. I should also mention that there was an amazing amount of trash and roadkill on the side of the highway (hence the title for the day). I got into camp around 7pm, setup, cooked some food and had my last cellphone conversation for a week. I was tired."
360,"The Data: Miles: 87.00Time: 8:43:14 (many)Max Speed: 34.9 mphAvg Speed: 9.9 mph The Route: Out of camp to the road, west on Sugar Ave (right turn), followed that until it T-boned with Railroad Ave, right turn and then immediate left to cross tracks, followed until 20/26, right turn onto 20/26 west, construction in Vale as 20/26 went their seperate ways (take 12th street out of town which becomes 26), continue long ways on 26 until you hit Unity, about 2 miles east of Unity there is a JCT with 245, right turn onto 245 N, follow for 3 miles, Unity Lake State Park is on your left with the standard brown with yellow/white engraved writing. If you've hit the day use area or Burnt Creek, you've gone too far. The Gory Details: Long day, oy vey! Up at 7am and on the road by 9:30am. Later than I wanted but I don't have a routine yet. The Railroad Ave threw me off a bit but I might not have remembered the lady telling me about it the night before. About 5 miles out I stopped at the scenic vista. Then 7 miles later I was in Vale. I stopped at the city park and historical point. A guy stopped and asked me where I was going, etc. and then we got talking about the Pacific Crest Trail. He was planning to hike it next year and I had hiked from BC to Harts Pass a few years ago. Getting out of Vale was a bit confusing because not only did 20 and 26 split, there was also construction going on. From Vale to Willow Creek, I played leapfrog with the highway line painting crew. They have a truck that drives along at 14 mph and the paint automatically gets sprayed on. Willow Creek had a cafe and store, Jamison had a post office and Brogan had a store/cafe/post office/tavern and a city park. I stopped at the park, had lunch and sat around for an hour. Just as I'm ready to go, I notice my rear tire is flat. I pump it up because I don't want to take the trailer off and change the tire. The air holds so I'm on my way. And it's nothing but HILL. I knew there were going to be some hills in this section but I didn't realize it was a big hill. The sun was blazing overhead (about 3pm) and the ambient temperature was probably around 95. Lunch wasn't sitting well. I felt hot, sick, tired and I wanted to quit. Ride down the hill to Brogan, call people in Boise and wait for the cavalry. But I kept going. It wasn't pretty. Pead a few hundred feet. Stop. Pedal more. Stop. Finally I got off and started walking. I try and find shade but very little is around. Less than a mile for the top, I see a cyclist coming down. She waves and I have barely the prescense of mind to nod and smile. A little later, a van stops and asks if I need water. Having drank most of mine, I said yes. You'd be amazed at how good cold water tastes. The guy and I chatted for a bit and I found out he was driving the sag wagon for The B.I.G. Ride 2003 (The Brain Injuries Great Ride 2003). And he is the husband of the rider I recently saw. Ben's stopping, chatting and water was enough to revive me. Thanks Ben!!! We traded info and went our seperate ways; him down, me up. A little while later I reached the summit of Brogan Hill (Elev. 3981'). After the summit, you drop down into Cow Valley with its rolling hills. They weren't that bad and I made good time. I reached Ironside around 7-7:30pm. It's a post office and a few houses and nearby ranches. Desperately in need of water, I asked a lady fixing a fence where I could get some. She pointed me to the facet next to the Post Office and said to replace the hose when I was done. She also told me about 2 grades and then rollers to Unity. I thanked her and filled up all my bottles which totalled almost a gallon of water (I sure as hell wasn't going to run out again!). I had 18 miles to go until Unity and about an hour until dark. Now some bathroom humor that I know touring cyclists will understand. What are the chances that 1) when you haven't seen a car for 10+ minutes and 2) you stop by the side of the road to pee that 3) a car will come along just as you finish? Let's say I wish I had that much luck when playing lotto. The road continued through rolling farmland though it was slow going. Then the road started going up. Maybe it wasn't as bad as Brogan Hill or maybe it wasn't as sunny (I did finish in the dark), but Eldorado Pass seemed relatively easy. It was still a workout but not that bad (Elev. 4623'). Near the top, there was a nice, graded turnout where I stopped on put on my knee and arm warmers, my bright-ass yellow rainjacket, headlamp and prepared to ride in the dark. Even though it was quite dark by this point, I continued to press on to Unity because I was in the land of private property/no trespassing and thus couldn't even stealth camp. My plan was to follow the white line on the side of the road and if a car came to pull off. This worked great until the summit when the white line disappeared. Then because my headlamp is not my Niterider, the followed the yellow line and reflectors and stayed away from the white reflectors (aka edge of the road reflectors). Luckily, less than 5 people passed me between Eldorado and Unity and I had plenty of time to get off the road. I thought about stopping at the bar in Unity but I decided not to. I continued on until I reached the junction with 245, which is 2 miles out of town. Just 3 miles to camp! At 3 miles, I saw a sign that said ""Overnight Camping Prohibited"" and my heart sank. I thought I had misread something somewhere. I then continued on the road until I saw some lights. As dogs were barking and the road was not signed, I figured it was private property next to Burnt Creek. So I resigned myself to going back to town and finding something there. On the way, I see a nicely reflective sign for Unity Lake State Park! I continue and find the entrance (which is easier to see going southbound). As I took the turn, I realized I was on gravel and decided to unclip. My left foot wouldn't unclip! I started losing my balance and took a sharp turn to the left. I briefly recovered when the sidewinder action of a fully loaded BOB got the best of me. I turned left and right, tried to unclip and then BAM! I landed on my left ass cheek around 9:45 PDT in the middle of a highway, and only then did my foot unclip. I'm glad it did otherwise I'd have a sore knee and a bruised ego. But it was my first I-can't-get-unclipped crash and every cyclist has one. It's almost like a right of passage for clipless pedals. I go into the campsite (the road is actually paved) and look around. The sign says all campsites are $17 but my book had listed a hiker/biker site for $4. I toodle around a bit while trying to decide. I'm on my way to ask the camp hosts and they pull up. They say that hiker/biker is indeed $4 a night and to go right over there by the teepees. I put on more clothes (it's cold!), eat some food, set up the tent, pay the fee, start writing this journal entry and fall alseep."
361,"The Data: Miles: 10.20 (not counted in total, to town and back)Time: 0:55:09Max Speed: 22.8 mphAvg Speed: 11.1 mph The Route: 245 to 26, 26 to Unity, reverse The Gory Details: I woke up and went back to bed. Repeated many times until I finally decided to get up and only because the sun was hot and bright in my tent. I had some oatmeal for breakfast which didn't sit well. I was exhausted. I went to fix my rear tire (which kept going flat on the previous day). There were no obvious holes so I resorted to the under water trick. I went down to the lake and within 2 feet of the water's edge, my feet were sinking in and the lake wasn't that deep. There was a funky smell but I think it was just alge. I went to the bathroom, plugged the drain temporarily and saw tiny bubble floating to the surface. I ended up losing the hole many times. I patched the tube but it didn't bond well so I patched it again. The culprit of the flat was a smal little thorn that poked in near the sidewall and created the tiniest little hole. While my rear wheel was off, I took the opportunity to clean the massive amounts of gunk out of my cogs. I then went into town in search of food and groceries. I ended up at the LO'asis Restaurant and had the ""Mama foot burger"". The burger was 6-8"" across and had 2 patties at 1/4"" thick each, cheese, tomatos, onions, sauce and pickles, with fries. Greasy as hell but damn good! It seemed to fall apart when I picked it up. Yum! I was talking with the waitress and she said that yesterday they closed US 395 due to wildfire (which was my route north in two days time). I checked at the ranger station down the street and they said only I-84 was delayed. After making my way back to the campground, taking a shower, and sitting down on a non-bike seat for a while I began to feel the best I had all day. I spent the rest of the afternoon catching up on my journal adn watching the other inhabitants of the campground. It was all RV folk who all seemed to have dogs. They also seemed to sit around for the whole day. Nice people though. Then a family came and moved into the teepee farthest from me. It was a mom and dad and two boys around 8-10 years old. It started me thinking and I remembered the speech from ""As You Like It"":  So here's my version, adapted for the campground. You start by car camping with your parents. Then you venture into the back country. Then you have kids and take them car camping. Then you retire and cruise around in an RV. Well, it's not as eloquent as Shakespeare, but I think you get the gist."
362,"The Data: Miles: 67.43Time: 6:04:43Max Speed: 35.2 mphAvg Speed: 11.0 mph The Route: US 245 to US 26 JCT, US 26 to Mt. Vernon, campground located next to the road The Gory Details: What a difference a shower and a good nights sleep make! I woke up at 6am but didn't get on the road until 8:30am (I'm trying to beat the heat here). Good news was that the patch on my rear tire held! Yay! The day turned out to be overcast and grey which was fine by me. US 245 was rollers with an upward bent to them. US 26 was rollers until you got out of the farmland and started climbing Blue Mountain Pass. It's a steeper one (maintaining about 5mph) but it only took me about 2 hours from camp to top. Then it was mostly downhill into Austin Junction. I picked up more gatorade and water at the store/cafe (I told you I wasn't running out again). I climbed up Dixie Pass (described as a long haul) and did the 7 miles in a little over an hour. It was a quite easy spin to the top. And, it's a bike route! Or at least it said to watch for bicyclists. On the way down Dixie Pass, I stopped at a scenic vista area with a  big wagon replica. Inside it was ads for businesses in Prarie City and John Day and outside was a plaque about the formation of the Strawberry Mountains. Then a lady pulled up. She was from the bay area and had just come from Burning Man. As I was telling her about this trip and website, she got this deja vu look about her. She said a guy she met at Burning Man was reading bike tour journals online and was about to do one because of it. Wethinks that it was on the crazyguyonabike site. How's that for feedback, Neil? ;-) It was a nice descent into Prarie City. I stopped at the Ranger Station to get an update on the 295 closure and wildfires. We figured that it was the 395/I-84 area near Pendleton that was closed. The lady gave me info about where I was going and gave me a heads up on the weather. I then cruised the rollers from Prarie City to John Day at about 20 mph. John Day is the biggest town around (pop. 2200+) and I had my choice of grocery store, bank, food, etc. I cruised through to see what was there and ended up at the Outpost and had myself a pizza. It wasn't Pagliacci's or Northlake Tavern & Pizza House, but it hit the spot. Instead of bringing out a measly glass of ice with a bit of water, the waitress brought out the glass and the pitcher of water! Her tip and bonus points took a big jump right there! About 4pm and full of pizza, I headed for the Thriftway because I was really craving veggies. I usually only crave veggies after a couple weeks at scout camp or the backcountry. As I'm locking up, some guy came over and said I had a ""tricked out trailer"". I respond that I like it too. Later, as I'm trying to figure out how to carry the veggies and not squish them, the guy comes up and asks where I'm coming from and going to. I find out he's with a group of bikers (of the Harley variety) from Puyallup who are going to Nevada. He wishes me luck on my trip and they wave as I ride off. That's one thing I like about touring by bike is that people come up and talk and say hi. That would rarely happen if I was in a car. I leave the store and am immediately into construction for the next 8 miles; all the way to Mt. Vernon. They're paving (blacktop) the road and so far only have one lane done, leaving a 2"" lip in the center of the road. And it makes the road a one lane, flagged road. I ride up to the flagger and she says I can jump from flagger to flagger as long as I get off the road when traffic comes. They all think I'm crazy. I'm going along and the wind starts blowing, rain starts falling and lightning starts flashing. Seeing a guy next to his truck, I ask if I can take cover for a little while. He offers a spot under his 5th-wheel and I take the opportunity to repack. He also offers the use of said 5th-wheel if the weather gets too bad. There was a point in camp that night when I was seriously considering it but it would've meant a 3 mile ride I didn't want to do. But I really appreciated the offer. The rain seemed to let up and I continued on down the road into more rain. I pulled into Clyde Holiday State Park. Their hiker/biker area is right next to the highway but luckily there isn't much traffic late at night. I put up my tent in an area next to the field between some trees. I also put up my tarp (1st time this trip) because I don't know how the tent will fare in the rain. By the time I got the tent up, the rain had pretty much died out and it was time for food. Not wanting to be rained on while cooking food (my raingear consisted of my cycling rain jacket), I devised the:  1. Boil water (more than the 2 cups for Top Ramen).2. While waiting for water to boil, chop veggies.3. Put veggies to go in first in the bottom of the bowl.4. Try and get the first veggies out without making a mess.5. Get frustrated and dump all the veggies into the now boiling water.6. Wait a while.7. Add Top Ramen.8. Continue according to Top Ramen Directions.9. When done, turn off stove and eat from pot under a shady tree. Careful - HOT! Disclaimer: I will not be held liable for you burning yourself or you making food unedible to eat or anything else for that matter. With the veggies, I could've cooked the carrots and green beans (fresh) more. The mushrooms were nicely done and picked up a bit of the beef flavoring packet making them quite tasty. The Roma tomatos disinigrated. Sometime that evening I rode to town and back twice so I could call my friend Jenny and let her know I'm alright. First I went for a phone card. Then I came back to camp and tried that phone. It didn't work. I then went back to town and found a working phone (right next to the laundromat). I then went back to camp which was quite fun in the dark. People also make a bigger deal about me riding in the rain than not having lights. It was weird. I then took a shower, washed my dishes, put on dry clothes, crawled into my sleeping bag and was as snug as a bug in a rug."
363,"The Data: Miles: 50.13Time: 6:21:07Max Speed: 37.9 mphAvg Speed: 7.8 mph The Route: US 26 into the town of Mt. Vernon, right turn onto US 395 North, camp spot was right off the highway The Gory Details: Disclaimer: The day is being written about many days after if happened (um... October 19, 2003). I'll try to provide what detail I can remember. I was so exhausted after this day that I barely wrote down the data. Then the next few days I didn't have a chance to get caught up with the journal either. All other days, unless noted, were written about that night or in the few days after. I knew it was going to be a hilly day. I just didn't realized how hilly it was going to be. I woke up early, hearing the ODOT crews working on the highway. I start breaking camp and getting my bike ready. I'm pumping up the rear tire and I hear air escaping. I wiggle the valve stem a bit and hear a ""whooooosh"" of air. My second flat tire of the trip. I pull the wheel off and, sure enough, there's a nice tiny hole in the side of the valve stem. I look to see what might've caused it but to no avail. I swap out tubes. I'm down to 1 spare but I'll be in Pendleton in a few days so they should have a bike shop. I finally get going a while later. Once again I go into town and this time through a construction zone. The turn-off to 395N is obvious. The first sign that comes up says ""Pendleton 120 miles"". Most people would say, ""Hmmm... that's 2 hours, lets get some gas at the conviently located Texaco"". I looked at it and said ""Hmmm... that's 2 days of riding."" The first part (until the Beechcreek summit) was slightly uphill through a canyon with a twisting road. It got steeper near the summit. You get to the top and look down into a great expanse of high country valley that streches far and wide. You then descend into said valley and pass through the town of Fox. Not much is there. Next up was a very steep and seemingly endless hill. With my maps showing only 8 miles to Long Creek (and not much being in Fox), I decided not to take lunch. Instead I just munched on trail mix. I start climbing the hill out of Fox. My cadence slows down. My speed slows down. The sun beats down. I finally get off and walk. It seems steep but I keep telling myself that it's my imagination. However, when the passing lane appears, I begin to doubt the voices in my head. A long while later (and running out of water), I reach the summit. I look back and a sign for trucks warns of a steep grade (6+%). On the way down, I see a ""Rest Area"" sign. I stop, hoping for water. Nope, just a vault toilet. I don't call that a rest area. However, it's basically all downhill until Long Creek. I stop at the cafe/store and have a really yummy, delicious sandwich with fries. And I also buy a gallon of water to drink and take with me. Nice and cold, too. As I start the first climb out of town, I begin to regret the fries. From here on out is high prairie rangeland country. It's vast and the distances are deceiving. What looks like a down and up turns out to be a few minutes down and many minutes (20+) up. This scenario repeats many times. Eventually I ended up on top of Ritter Butte (elevation 3993'). I looked east and about 2-3 valleys over, I could see smoke drifting up. I'd heard about wildfires nearby so I figured it must be that. Descending Ritter Butte was a blast! I only wish that I had stopped and taken a picture of what I though to be Ritter Butte. Beautiful! I had a car patiently follow behind me for most of the way down. I tried to let him go by on the few straight streches but he stayed back. I did hit my max of 37.9 mph, which wasn't that far below the speed limit. I would've stopped but the road didn't allow it (no shoulder, curvy). Once I got to the bottom and past the construction zone, I was able to pull off and let him by. By this point, it was late afternoon and I had 40 miles to go before I hit Ukiah, which was my goal for the night. However, the next 10-15 miles seemed to conspire against me. I was a long climb from where I was to the top of Meadow Brook Pass (4127'). By the time I got to the top, it was about 7:30pm or so and the sun was going down. Knowing that I had 20 miles to go to Ukiah, but not knowing what the road was like, I decided to look for some place to stay. As I'm descending the pass, I come across Meadow Brook RV & Cafe (or something like that). At the moment I saw they had tent camping, my body decided to go no further. I rolled up outside the office and leaned my bike against a log. A lady washing dishes in the kitchen looks out the window and says ""Oh my!"". I talked with the guy for a while about where I'd been and where I was going. It was $10 for a tent spot and I had a big field to choose from. I start setting up camp and was moving slow. This place has a store, a cafe, a pay phone, a game cooler, a bathroom with flush toilets and a shower, 2 sets of washer/dryers (coin-op) and the best tasting water from the tap that I'd had in a long while! I then spent a long time on the phone. I called my friend Jenny (who was acting as my contact person), my brother in Arizona and my parents (who seemed glad to hear my voice). I'm sure this trip gave my mom a few grey hairs. I then cooked spaghetti, took a shower and crashed."
364,"The Data: Miles: 26.77Time: 2:30:22Max Speed: 34.8 mphAvg Speed: 10.6 mph The Route: US 395 North, town is northeast of the campground (go east 1 mile on 244) The Gory Details: Slept in until 7:40am. Quite cold out. Finally left around 10:30am. And it was all downhill from there, to Dale at least. In Dale I stopped for Twinkies and Cheetos. I was hoping they'd have a cafe but that was back where I camped. So, junk food for breakfast. Then the road goes down a bit more and you enter the Ukiah-Dale Scenic Cooridor. The road proceedes to follow the river through the canyon on quite a twisty road. It's a set of rollers but slow ones. I then got to the campsite, cruised around and went on towards town. I ate lunch at the Landmark restaurant where a deluxe means ""with fries or potato salad"". Not wanting a repeat of previous days afternoon stomach extravaganzas, I went for the potato salad. The cheeseburger was yummy but the potato salad could've used more jelling together with itself. After lunch was done, I tried to find a copy of the Oregonian (which had a story about the Ride Around Oregon) but to no avail. I went back to the campsite and asked the ranger if there were any hiker/biker sites. He said no, just primitive sites (RV driveway, picnic table, fire pit, no hookups or fires). We shot the shit for a while. I found out that this is big game country and bow hunting season. In a couple of weeks it's gun season where they walk around with a beer in one hand and a high-power rifle in the other. Usually they're okay but Darwin takes care of a few now and then. And now, knowing that it's hunting season, all the people with RVs, ATvs, camo, beer and all the game coolers make sense. The below is written at a later date (October 19, 2003) I'm sitting in the campsite for a while. I'm airing some stuff and drying other stuff. Catching up on previous journal entries. A guy comes up and I think his name was Jim. He was riding a Harley from Texas to the coast. We talk for a while. He says that when he got out of the army back in '73-'74, he rode a bike from Georgia to Canada. He said back then you were a total nutcase to ride a bike. I'm glad times have changed a little (people tell me I'm a nut). He also told me of a time he was up in Alaska and met a guy riding a bike. This guy rode from the southern tip of South America to Alaska. The guy was covered in grime and his spare tube had more patches on it than I had mosquito bites on my legs. Wow. Dinner was spaghetti again and I cooked extra for breakfast. Once it was dark, I had a couple deer come through camp. I was on the side next to the highway, but the ranger said it was quiter than the areas by the river. As long as you didn't mind the occasional car or truck, he was right. Then again, falling asleep wasn't that hard."
365,"The Data: Miles: 78.28Time: 6:38:17Max Speed: 35.0 mphAvg Speed: 11.7 mph The Route: US 395 North until Pendleton, continued on US395/I84 (not recommended! see below) until exit #207, crossed over freeway onto Rieth Road, followed Rieth Road 20 miles until Echo, diagonal RR tracks within the first 5 miles of Rieth Rd (careful!). Once in Echo, where the Oregon Trail Auto Route turns left and crosses the railroad tracks, do so likewise. This will put you on Main St. There's a Post Office on the left and a cafe and cafe/bar/saloon/lodging on the right. Ft. Henrietta RV Park is 1 block down and well signed (on the left). $15 per night for tent on grass behind RVs. Bathroom needs key (get from host, drop in box on way out). Nearby park with Oregon Trail info. The Gory Details: Dragged myself out of my nice warm sleeping bag at 6am. It was going to be a long day (est. 60 miles to Echo or 80 to Umatilla) and I wanted to get an early start. I was on the road by 8am. The first bit (until the Snow Zone sign) was rolling hills but with more hills than roll. A nice warm up. The weather was threatening rain. Note to self: keep rain jacket on outside of perfectly balanced load. Up until the snow zone, it was farmland. For a while, I saw some sort of bird that led me down the road. It would stop and once I got closer, it would fly off and around until the next post. This repeated many times. It was a large-ish bird but I never could get close enough to get a picture (next time I'm bringing the telephoto lense). It was just cool, riding along with a chill and moisture in the air, following a bird on a little traffic sunday morning before the RVers woke up. A while later, I came across a dead owl in the middle of the road. It looked like it just dropped from the sky. No blood or impact marks. I'll post the pictures eventually so you can decide. This was the only ""roadkill"" I took a picture of because, well, it didn't look like roadkill. It just looked like it dropped dead. Once you get to the snow zone sign, you start climbing Battle Creek Mountain. It's almost like Blue Mountain but not as easy as Dixie Pass. When you get to the top of Battle Creek, there's a day use park with lots of picnic tables, bathrooms and a sign telling you the signifigance of Battle Creek Mountain. After that, it was rollers with a downhill bent all the way to Pilot Rock. I made good time keeping my speed at 18+mph for the most part. With all my warmers & rainjacket on, it being cold and crisp air tinged with smoke and a fast easy ride, I felt like I was in Bicycling Magazine's ""25 Best Fall Rides!"" article. I would definately put Ukiah to Pilot Rock in that category as long as you do it in early September. I stopped for brunch in Pilot Rock at the Roundup Room, right as you come into town. The french toast hit the spot. For the past week, I hadn't had much direct human contact and all felt right in the world eating french toast and watching Sunday morning football. And I'm usually one who doesn't care about it. I lost my rhythm and gained a headwind between Pilot Rock and Pendleton. Today I was so excited to get to Pendleton, but once I got there, I immediately wanted to leave. The Chamber of Commerce was closed. I didn't know if bikes were allowed on 395/I84. A nearby bike shop was closed. The road I was looking for ""didn't exist"" under that name. Gas stations are staffed by surely teenagers who don't want to be there, talk loudly to each other about the most inane things while slowly ringing up your purchase and smoke within 10' of gas pumps. I was originally thinking about finding a library or internet access so I could update this journal but I just wanted to leave. A note for bikers: If you ask for directions and they say ""take the freeway"", don't do it. Ask about an alternate route. You'll be much happier and safer for it, even if it is 2 miles longer. So I was looking for ""Old Pendleton River Road"". I couldn't find any signs to it (and it's a ""scenic drive"" so I figured it would be easy to find). I asked at a gas station and they told me I was looking for ""Rieth Road"" (correct). I asked how to get there. Just take the freeway. ""With this?"" I ask, pointing to my bike & trailer. ""Are bikes even allowed?"" ""Oh yeah."" they reply (the ""kids"" working at the gas station). They mentioned an alternate route but made it seem like it was way out of the way. I figured since the road was I84/US395, bikes should be allowed and it couldn't be that bad, right? WRONG. There were no signs saying ""Bicycles Prohibited"" so I tried it anyway. The shoulder, while big, was filled with crap. Dead tires, dirt, gravel, and some very bad rumble strips. They were about a foot wide, 4"" in the other direction and a few inches deep. Fine if you're in a car but with a bike and trailer, very bad. Whenever I hit these, I would almost lose control and crash. Luckily, the exit I wanted was the first one I came to so I didn't have to cross any. I took the exit and then didn't know where to go. I saw an RV park so I went there to ask directions. The lady (thank you!) actually knew where I was talking about and knew how to get there. Finally, I was on my way out of Pendleton. Below written on October 20, 2003 How the cycle through Pendleton to Echo You come into town on US 395 North. Follow the signs to the City Center or Tourist info. Watch out for the railroad tracks as you get into the downtown area, they are a doozy. Once downtown, you get on Highway 30 Eastbound. This should parallel 395/I84. After a while (an a climbing ofthe hill) you'll see an RV park (Ridgecrest???) up on the hill to your right. This is the one I went to. There are also murals around it (of pioneers and such) so it's easy to spot. There's a road to your left that goes over the freeway. Take this. You'll go downhill (a John Deere store will come up on your left) and just follow the road. You will then be riding through a residential area called Rieth, and be on Rieth Road. I haven't ridden the Highway 30 route, but it seems a damn lot better than 395/I84, even if it is a couple miles out of the way. Rieth Road (or on my maps as ""Old Pendleton River Road"") has a varied surface; some smooth asphalt, some not. It's a narrow and curvy road (thanks for the warning!) but there is hardly any traffic. I think I counted less than ten cars in the 20 mile journey. It's a beautiful canyon that follows the river and train tracks. That does not mean that it's flat. There are a lot of ups and downs but it's pretty managable. The scenery more than makes up for it. Once I post the pictures, you'll see what I mean. I would recommend a helmet as you do ride through areas of ""Falling Rock"" with previous debris on the road from it. It started to rain about 3pm but the rain just added to the fun. It was a nice afternoon of riding. The miles count down to Echo so you can see how much farther you have to go. This road is listed as a scenic drive but can you really enjoy and appreciate the scenic while driving? I think not, IMHO. I got into Echo and looked at my cyclometer. It said 78 miles. I had only estimated 60 miles to Echo. Oops. Because it was raining and I was tired, I decided not to press on to the Hat Rock campground in Hermiston/Umatilla (est. at 80 miles for the day). I set up my tent, put some dry clothes on and went in search of food. I ate at the cafe/bar/saloon/lodging (brown, tall building). I had a nice steak, potatos, overdone veggies and a Corona. If you're looking for beer in the boonies, it's usually Bud, MGD or Coors. A group of eight came in when I was about to leave. They ordered but on all their salads, they didn't want croutons or and sort of starches. I thought they were giving the waitress (who was new) shit, but then they said (as the waitress probably had a confused look on her face also) ""Oh, we're all on Atkins. We've all lost XX pounds since mm/dd/yyyy"". My theory? Ride 60+ miles per day while towing 70lbs of gear (50lbs gear, 13 lbs trailer and 8lbs gallon of water). Eat what you want. But I might be a bit biased. We talked for a while and they had the usual questions/concerns. I then went back to camp, took a shower, attempted to write a journal entry and promptly fell asleep."
366,"The Data: Miles: 62.13Time: 6:21:38 (7:36:01 total time)Max Speed: 35.3 mphAvg Speed: 9.7 mph The Route: Echo (Rieth Rd) to 395N, 395N turns left at Highway 730 (in Hermiston/Umatilla), right onto I82, across bridge over the Columbia River (pedestrian walkway available, watch out for rumble strips), exit to 14W, left turn onto 14W, right turn onto 221, eventually enter Prosser, straight at JCT with 22, stop at the Exxon. Take left out of Exxon and follow the road curve to the right and over bridge, continue to Merlot Drive (the street before the I82 overpass with Texaco, McDonalds, & Burger King), right turn onto Merlot Drive, right turn after Subway into Wine Country RV Park. The Gory Details: Today was a tough one. It had been raining since 3pm yesterday afternoon. I debated whether to stay or go. At 8am, I called Jenny and then Miller to get weather and traffic info. Weather was for clearing in the afternoon with a west wind. Decided to wait some more. I changed into bike clothes and snuggled up in my sleeping bag to warm up again. The rain finally stopped and I broke camp. By the time I started, it was about 11:30am, my latest start the whole trip. At first I couldn't figure out which way to go. I knew I had seen the sign for Hermiston but couldn't remember where. I eventually located it on Rieth Road. That led me to Stanfield and Hermiston and that's where I began to go crazy. Once you hit those towns, the nice two-lane 395 becomes a four-lane road with stripmalls and stupid people (much like Aurora/SR99 in Seattle). There's something about a four-lane road that makes people not want to move over to pass you, thus you get buzzed by everything. The right lane was big enough to have a shoulder stripe but it didn't. So when the big trucks started coming, I would veer out and ""take the lane"", forcing them to move over. It felt like an asshole thing to do but on a day like this (a strong west wind), it was what I had to do to keep from getting squashed. By the time I was almost out of town, I had reverted to the in-city-bring-it-on-you-wanna-play-I-ain't-takin-no-shit from-you attitude. Of course, town looked like the four-lane, stripmall ugliness that went on for many miles. Also, Hermiston is a Wal-Mart truck hub. Millions on Wal-Mart trucks prowling around at the truck place. It was creepy. I finally got out of town and saw where I would've stayed had I continued last night. I crossed the bridge on I82/395 and almost crashed on the rumble strips. Back in Washington! Land of sales tax and expensive campgrounds. But, you can pump your own gas! Highway 14 west was a 15-20 mph steady headwind with gusts more than that, a small shoulder, small lanes and trucks that can't/won't move over to pass you. Not fun. The trucks would come up, block the wind and then when they were past you, the wind and the truck wash was a double-whammy that quite literally pushed me here and there and almost down on the ground. I had lunch in Paterson (right at the JCT of 14 & 221). From there I maintianed a 12mph average until milepost 12 when I decided to take a break. Highway 221 is probably the minimum width necessary as trucks were passing way close. I started nodding thanks to the ones that gave me room. This got better as the afternoon got into evening. It's rolling country with an uphill bent. The road goes north-south until about milepost 17 (a welcome relief from the westernly headwind earlier) when it curves back towards the west. Then you get to a series of longer climbs into that wonderful headwind. Beautiful, vast farmland. What you think is a half mile is actually 2-3 miles. Around milepost 21 or 22, you begin a 2 miles climb that curves north about halfway through. Then you get to the top that has a trucker brake check area. So what do you do if your brakes are dead? Just sit there? Once you've solved that mystery, it's a sweet 2+ mile downhill into Prosser. It was getting late (around 7pm) and I decided to look for somewhere to stay instead of doing 30 miles in the dark to Granger. Instead of turning left onto 22 (and heading in the direction of Granger), I went straight and followed the ""Visitor's Route"". Somewhat lost and not knowing where to find anything, I stopped at the Exxon and asked the lady if there were any campgrounds or such around. She gave me directions and asked about my trip. She was interested in my trip which was nice because people in gas stations usually aren't interested. I started going through town. I thought I had missed the turn I was looking for. I was coming up on the I82 interchange and didn't want to deal with it so I took a right... right onto the street (Merlot Drive) I wanted. I told the lady in the office about my trip and she looked at me in amazement. For $12.01 (ah, the land of sales tax), I got myself a place to put the tent. It's a sandbox in the middle of grass. The grass has an irrigation system so you can't put tent stakes or other pokey items into it. I setup my tent and went in search of food. I was hoping to ""Eat Fresh"" but Subway was closed. The ATM at the Texaco was broken so I spent $9.24 of my $10 on jerky, gatorade, twinkies and a copy of the Seattle Times. I then went across to McDonalds, got food and cash back ($20 limit) and rode my bike carrying a bag of food and a drink in one hand and steering with the other. I ate dinner, took a shower ($0.25 for 3 minutes), did laundry in the sink and spent the rest of my quarters (and two of another guy's - Thanks!) drying said clothes. My ""delicates"" (bike gear) finally dried but the cotton stuff would have to wait for B.O.B. tomorrow. And in such an event of multi-tasking, I was able to write most of this journal entry while waiting for said clothes to dry. Ah, clean laundry. :-) The pattern thus continues: eat, try to finish journal entry, and fall asleep.     "
367,"Yes, another quick note. All the entries for Washington are entirely written after I got back to Seattle (written in Feb. 2004). Washington was a series of long days that had the same pattern: ride, eat, ride, eat, setup camp, eat, fall asleep while trying to write journal entry, wake up, shift to more comfortable position, and fall asleep. Then as I've been back, I've been very busy with shows and have finally hit a lull in February (though I'm not complaining at all). So what this means is route descriptions will be more sparse as will event descriptions. I remember quite a few things but there's nothing like writing something down after it happened and then transcribing it onto the web. Hopefully during this lull, I'll also get the scanner to work and get some pictures up."
368,"The Data: Miles: 97.88Time: 8:38:51 (10:34:24 total time)Max Speed: 32.0 mphAvg Speed: 11.3 mph The Route: Wine Country RV Park back to main road (I think Wine Country Rd.) from previous night. Retraced route until I reached the junction with 221 & 22. Took a right (west) onto 22. Stopped for lunch in Toppenish. Continued on US 97. Around Union Gap, took the exit to Union Gap (the town) and followed that all the way through Yakima (in Yakima it was 1st Ave South and then North). Then went North on SR 821 aka ""Yakima River Canyon"". Exited out of the north end of the canyon and followed the signs into Ellensburg. Followed the road up the hill and turned left on (8th Ave?, there was a 7-11, I asked for directions at the 76). Followed this road for a while. You then pass through an Interstate Munchie Stop (gas/food/etc). You then climb the overpass and before you head down, you take a left turn (signed, with a turn lane). Almost immediately, you take a left turn into the KOA. Office is to the right. The Gory Details: The longest day! Almost a century. I didn't do a century for 2 reasons: a) I was bloody tired, and b) if I was going for a century, I wasn't going to finish it with ""junk miles"" just so I could bag a century. I started out by retracing my steps the previous night. I could've taken the Yakima Valley Highway but nobody I talked to had heard about it so I just continued on SR 22. I left early and it was gray and a bit cold. The terrain was flat, so I made good time. SR 22 follows the railroad tracks and had gentle inclines every so often to keep life interesting. The wind wasn't much of a problem, as far as I remember. It was a pleasant ride through farmland. A few workers saw me and waved and I waved back. I arrived in Toppenish (I think that's where I stopped) and looked for food. Nothing really grabbed me so I stopped at the Dairy Queen. After my lunch stop, I picked up US 97 which has two lanes in each direction but a nice shoulder. The terrain was mostly flat. If you like fruit, this is the place to be. Every 500 feet or so, it seemed like there was another sign or turn-off for fruit. Or at least a sign saying ""Fruit... turn left 500 feet"". It continues this way until you hit Union Gap, which is quite a gap. These two sets of hills come in from your left and right and right where the highway goes is a gap. A natural one, as far as I can tell. As you're going through the gap, you have a choice: continue and pick up the interstate or go through town. I chose to go through town. The exit leads you through Union Gap (the town) and on into Yakima. I didn't really know where I was going at the time except that I wanted to pick up 821 on the north end of Yakima. So I just kept riding. I spotted a Key Bank (102 E Yakima Ave at 2:34pm, I love finding ATM receipts!) and made my way over as quickly as I could. To have cash again, without a fee was so nice! Yay! Only later (as I'm mapping the location on Yahoo) that I realize I was at the center of Yakima. At that intersection, north became south, east became west and vice versa. The cash was doubly important because the camping prices (state parks and such) in Washington are higher than those in Oregon. I was going to ask for directions but all of a sudden I found out where the sidewalk ends (and no, I wasn't riding on the sidewalk). Congratulations! You've reached the junction of US 97, US 12 & I 82. You're on a bike. There's 3-4 lanes going your general direction. You need to get over to the far left. Thankfully it isn't rush hour. If you can't tell, here was one of my more scarier moments on the trip. From this point you want to go to Selah. The US 97 route is near the left side of the road. What did I do? Said a quick prayer, looked for a break in traffic and rode like the wind. I remember going over a bridge and then merging in from the left. As I was going 20-30 mph and holding on for dear life, I signal that I want to move right and some kind folks let me in. Back on the shoulder. Yay! Then I get into Selah. I don't know where I'm going so I get Gatorade as I ask directions. From where I was, I took some road or another until I missed the road I wanted. Then I took the next road and getting across the main road (4 lanes in heavy traffic) was not fun. Basically you want to end up on Hillcrest Drive and then Harrison Rd (the latter is clearly marked, it's a three-way intersection-some-stop-some-don't-crazyness). You then pass by a cafe or store of  some sorts and then that's it for the next 25 miles except some fishing outlets and actually a campground on the river. By now I'm on SR 821 aka Yakima River Canyon Rd. Apart from the initial climb, it's mostly flat and a wonderful afternoon ride. The sun is out but not too hot, the sky is clear, the temperature is just about perfect and the groove is on. It is a beautiful canyon and highly recommended. There wasn't much total car traffic so even with the non-existant shoulders it was okay. I found myself riding in the tire tracks for most of the day today - it beat the constant vibration of the not smooth road. There were a couple historical/informational sites, a bunch of fishing sites, some homes but not much was developed. I hope they keep it that way. Partway through I hear a noise and next thing I know, a cop car goes screaming past me. Never found out what was going on. You know you're having a good day when you see a small rise and decide to power over it instead of gearing down and pedaling. Ah yeah! -grin- At this point, I'd like to give a major shoutout/thank you to Ben Staley (http://www.crazyguyonabike.com/doc/bens) who suggested the 821/Canyon route from Yakima to Ellensburg. It made for a beautiful afternoon. Once you get to the end, it's not as fun a ride into Ellensburg. The road is really in bad condition and after a long day in the saddle, you really wish WA-DOT knew how to make smooth roads. Note to self: stop away from grassy/marshy areas to put on warmers or you will get eaten alive. Once again, I got into town and didn't have a clue to where I was going. I stopped at the 76 and asked directions. The reaction of the two guys adds another mark in the disbelief/you're crazy column. But they gave good directions and I was on my way. You go through town up to 8th Ave (or so) and take a left. This puts you on a long road heading west that seems to parallel I-90. Then you get to the munchie stop. Head straight through this up onto an overpass and get in the left turn lane. Right after you make the turn is the KOA. I went into the office, paid my $20 and went to setup camp. The ground was quite hard and cigarette butts were scattered all around. And the laundry facility was already closed. I was not impressed. I got the tent up, changed out of my riding clothes and went in search of food. I went back to the munchie stop and had dinner at Perkins. Whatever I had (I think it was roast beef, et al & lots of water), it tasted so good! I almost fell asleep right on the table. I then stopped next door at the Subway/store/super-truck-stop for tomorrow's breakfast: Subway Club. Some days I have good timing and this was one of them. Right after I ordered, a busload of kids arrived and descended on the Subway. I got out of there in the nick of time. I got back to my camp and noticed my neighbors had a campfire. It was a really odd sight from being in the high fire danger areas all the way from Boise. Apparently it was okay here. I was tempted to build my own and/or crash theirs but I was quite tired. I took a shower which felt so good (luckily those are open 24/7 or there would've been hell to pay). Since I was close to civilization, I called everybody I needed to. Spent a while on the phone but it was good to talk to people that I know again. And then the usual: try to write and fall asleep."
369,"The Data: Miles: 59.42Time: 6:08:52 (8:32:00 total time)Max Speed: 36.5 mphAvg Speed: 9.6 mph The Route: US 97 to US 2, left on US 2 (west) to Leavenworth The Gory Details: I had a chance to talk to my neighbors (I had neighbors; it was sort of strange). I don't remember if they were from Seattle but a friend or relative attended the Art Institute. We all agreed that the Yakima River Canyon was a beautiful trip. And I figured out as I was packing up was that I camped right next to the Yakima River. I left about 10:40am looking for US 97 North. The actual highway is a ways off so you sort of zig and zag through the area. I just followed the signs. For most of the way it was an uphill grade with a strong west wind. Thus it seemed like another day of grinding through. Eventually you get to the top of the hill which has a nice viewpoint of the valley you'll be descending into. There also appeared to be a road that went around the hill, but what would be the fun in that? There was a turn-off for that road (I think) before the hill but then you miss the view and sweet downhill on the other side. From the top, it was all downhill to the junction. The next place I arrived at was the junction of US 97N and SR 970 or something. I took a right which was in the direction of Liberty, WA. Soon after I came upon the Liberty Cafe and Liberty Espresso. Not knowing what food awaited me between here and there, I stopped for lunch. The French Dip sandwich and mug of hot chocolate hit the spot. I was heading into hunting country again. One guy, in disbelief of what I was doing, offered a ride the next day over Snoqualmie Pass. They also questioned why I was going north out of my way when I could just ""hop over"" on I-90. Well, I was going to visit family and the thought of biking over Snoqualmie on the Interstate was not that appealing, especially after my Pendleton adventure (see Day 7). After the usual ""you're crazy"" and ""go for it"", a couple locals warned me about the truckers on this section that liked to hug the curves tight. I said thanks and biked away. On this whole trip so far, the truckers seemed to be the best and most courteous around. After lunch I began the climb up Blewet Pass (elev. 4102'). For most of the way it was an easy grade that wound through the forest. This is another place that I would like to ride again. Without realizing it previously, I had spent quite a bit of time in this area when I was in Scouts. A lot of the surroundings and national parks that I passed looked quite familiar. It was like a trip down memory lane. Unfortunately, most of those parks were closed. Within a couple miles of the top, it became steep. I finally got to the actual top (there seemed to be a couple of false peaks). I knew I was there because I saw the all important summit sign. I stopped for a break and tried to call my relatives as they weren't expecting me until the next day. My phone wouldn't work. So much for technology. It was all downhill from there. I stopped part of the way down at a store and tried to get a hold of them from a pay phone but they were out. I don't remember the name of the store but it had a great FAQ on the front. It's on the right as you're going downhill (north) and you can't miss it, well, unless you're going 55 mph. The road continued downhill all the way to the junction with US 2. There I took a left (west) to Leavenworth. If you've never been to Leavenworth, you're in for a treat (and a surprise). The whole town has a Bavarian theme to it. Everywhere, including the McDonald's and the Safeway. It becomes a bit of a tourist trap (more about this on the next day's journal) but you really should go visit it (more than just stopping for gas). I found my way to my relative's house and waited on their lawn until they came home. Imagine coming home and some strangely dressed guy is sitting on your lawn. Lets just say it made for some confusing amusing moments until we all recognized each other. :-) It had been about a year since we all had seen each other and I wasn't expected until the next day. We went inside and as I hadn't eaten yet, started going through the fridge. I settled on French Toast for dinner. Yummy! Once everybody else got home, we sat around and caught up on the past year or so. Originally I was only going to stay a night but decided to spend the next day also. I needed the rest and well, a warm bed and gracious hospitality didn't hurt either. :-)"
370,"The Data: Miles: 7.17Time: 0:36:18Max Speed: 25.3 mphAvg Speed: 11.8 mph The Route: All around Leavenworth, WA The Gory Details: I decided the night before to stay another day. Part of my reasoning was that I had always been through Leavenworth but never been to Leavenworth. The other part was that I needed a rest day. I also needed to stop and tell myself that I was going to get home when I got home and just relax. After breakfast and a shower I went out on the town. First I got my errands done (bank, food for the next few days, etc.). Somewhere during the day I stopped at the library to try and update this page but all the computers were being used and I didn't want to wait. I then parked my bike in the town square (I guess you would call it that) and walked around for a few hours. Yes, there are bike racks there, you just have to find them. I went to the Christmas shop (yes, Christmas all year round), the train sign shop, the ice cream shop (yum!), the burger stand on the side of the building (yum!) and many other places. I also made my way down to the city park and walked around there for a while. It has lots of trails that loop around. There's historical info and plant life info scattered all around. Pretty interesting stuff. Remember yesterday when I said that everything had the Bavarian theme to it? Well, I came upon these two tourists that had minicams and were taking footage of a building. One said ""And that's a Mexican restaurant."" I can't wait to view that tape -smirk-. Sorry, my local side was emerging. How can I be local if I'm the tourist you ask? Easy. I go to the tourist spots but don't totally act touristy and have you ever been to the Ballard Locks in the summertime? That's where I'm a local. Um pardon me, coming through, no these walkways really aren't meant for handicams and double wide strollers, I'm sorry. 'Nuff said. I make it back to the house (my bike is still the color green) and have dinner. Then in celebration of Chris being there one year, we all pile into the car and go to Dairy Queen. After that, I get taken on a tour of local sites. We get to the ski hill and John points out a place on the other end of town high up in the hills and says that we can get there in 15 minutes. Sure enough, 15 minutes later, were standing on the top of the hill, looking down on Leavenworth and their house. It wasn't until we got up there that I realized how close the Icicle Creek Fire from a few years ago came to Leavenworth and their house. It blew me away. Wow. We then went home and turned in because we all had big days the next day. I'd like to take a moment to thank John and Kathy and Matt and Chris for inviting me into their home. You guys were wonderful and gracious and I had a great time. Thank you."
371,"The Data: Miles: 76.00Time: 7:15:19 (9:23:42)Max Speed: 37.7 mphAvg Speed: 10.4 mph The Route: US 2 from Leavenworth to Goldbar, followed the signs to Wallace Falls State Park in Goldbar The Gory Details: After a day of rest I left Leavenworth to climb every mountain... well, at least Steven's Pass. It was a beautiful day - the sun was shining but it wasn't too warm or too cold. It was a nice grade most of the way; I was able to keep a nice pace. I stopped at a nice rest area next to the river. It's a pit toilet/picnic area before you get to the ""industrialized"" rest area. I think it was Tumwater Creek but I don't have any maps in front of me to verify on. The only thing that really spoiled it was the mess previous people had left all over. It was insane. I was always taught to ""pack it in, pack it out"", ""leave no trace"" and ""leave it better than you found it"" (can you tell I was in Boy Scouts? ;-) ). I considered picking it up but didn't have space, didn't see any garbage cans, didn't want to throw it down the pit and didn't have a way to carry it. Lame excuses but at least I wasn't the schmuk who put it there in the first place. So I hopped back on the bike and carried on. I stopped next at the Nason Creek Safety Rest Area. It's the ""industrialized"" one I mentioned earlier. You know how people say ""it's a small world""? Well it bloody is. I pull into the rest stop and start talking (or they start talking to me) to an older coulpe next to their pickup truck. It turns out that I was in the same grade & graduating class as their grandson. Hi guys! All together now! Sing-along time! ""It's a small, small world!"" I continued on up the pass. Stevens Pass is interesting because it was originally a railway with the easiest grade for the trains to get from the Leavenworth area over the Cascades. The town center in Leavenworth has some information on it and I'm sure there's stuff on the web. Of course that doesn't mean it was a 2% grade all the way. Nope, not going to happen. It was a tolerable grade although it got steeper within a mile of the summit. I eventually made it to the top and took the obligatory summit picture. Then I put on my rain jacket for wind protection and flew down the other side. I seem to say this about all downhills, but this on in particular was a blast. I stopped at a restaurant for some well deserved lunch as it was about 2 in the afternoon. It then took me the rest of the day to get to Goldbar. Highway 2 was in good condition but at many times the shoulder is very lacking and the highway is narrow enough (mostly on bridges) where you have to take the lane. It's also a very busy highway with a steady stream of cars. Much different than I was used to. It's amazing how fast you get used to the deserted backroads. It also didn't help that it was a Friday when everybody leaves work early and heads to the mountains. As you get into Goldbar, be on a sharp lookout for the turn for Wallace Falls State Park. You'll be turning right but the sign wasn't that clear for me and I missed it. I doubled back which took forever because of the traffic. The signs take you through the neighborhoods and end with a steep but short climb into the park. There are a couple of group sites, about 6 ""personal"" sized sites and a bathroom - a no frills park. Make sure you fill out the correct slip and put it in the correct box as there's also a system for day use fees. Wallace Falls are actually a few miles up the trail and I didn't have time to go hike them. If I come back this way again, I'll definately go to the falls. I had some nice neighbors and a quite secluded campsite. I setup my tent, boiled a couple pots of spaghetti, called home for route suggestions for the next day, and then sacked out. I was both excited and sad that it was my last day on the trail. I loved being out there but on the other hand, I was so close to home I had short-timers. I hadn't seen my parents or family for over 4 months and was excited to see them. More on that tomorrow. Note: In my book on campsites, it mentioned that Wallace Falls State Park might become closed. Also there was a bulletin board devoted to a ""call to action"" to keep the park open. If I were you, I would definately check to see if it is still open."
372,"The Data: Miles: 86.68Time: 7:52:15Max Speed: 33.6Avg Speed: 11.0 The Route: US 2 from Goldbar to Monroe, Monroe to Duvall on the Monroe-Duvall Road, Duvall to Woodenville on the Woodenville-Duvall Road, twisted and turned by dead reckoning through Woodenville until I picked up the Samammish River/Burke Gilman Trail, a detour into Redmond and then back to the trail, SR/BG Trail around Lake Washington to 8th Ave in Seattle, then surface streets (Leary Way, Market, Shilshole Ave) to Golden Gardens Park, Golden Gardens Park through Ballard to Home. The Gory Details: The final day on the trail and a beautiful day it was too. I was up quite early because I knew I had about 80 some odd miles to go and a bunch of stops to make before I could ""officially"" make it home. The day started quite cool with low lying fog for most of the way to Monroe. I was on US 2 which was quite busy. There was a decent shoulder and I had my red blinky on so the fog just became fun and beautiful to ride through. I stopped at a gas station for a donut to supplement my cold pasta I had earlier for breakfast. I talked with a couple people there. I don't remember if their reactions to my trip were in awe or you're crazy but they wished me a good ride. The turnoff for the Monroe-Duvall Road is well signed as it's also known as WA 203. I think 522 would be a shorter trip but it's well known for shoulder driving and deadly accidents. The MD-Road was beautiful though. It was still early morning and all the fog hadn't burned off yet. I came across a field where the fog was lifting and the sun was filtering through. I got a great picture of it which I will post when I get back to Seattle this year (2004). As you get into Duvall, be on the lookout for the sign for the Woodenvill-Duvall Road. I missed the turn a few times until I finally found it. However, in my wanderings through town, I saw the firefighters hosting a pancake breakfast and everybody out and cleaning up a local park. It seemed like one big party. I finally found the turn and the resulting traffic. The WD-Road was busy; almost a constant stream of cars. There a few hills to go over but nothing really horrible. When I got into Woodenville, I had no idea of where I needed to go. This was the only day of my trip that I really didn't know where I was going except for a general idea. I crested the hill coming into town and seeing other bikers going downhill to my left... I took a left. After a while I took a right and rode right through the center of town (or so I think, it might've been a mall area). However, right in front of me (once I figured out how to get on to it) was the Samammish River Trail. I rode into Redmond, stopped at a sign, figured I was at the right road (Redmond Way) and started up the big hill. Since I had been on that road last, the Billy McHales closed and the DOT tore up the road. Instead of fighting with heavy car traffic uphill through a construction zone, I crossed to the other side of the street and walked on the sidewalk. I made it past the construction and started riding again. I got to the top (about 132nd) and headed towards my brother's house in Kirkland. He seemed quite surprised to see me especially since I hadn't seen him since May. Everybody else was wondering who that crazy looking guy on a bike was. I didn't spend a lot of time as it was getting into mid-afternoon and I had a good 30+ miles to go. Back down the hill (fun!) to the trail. A sunny Saturday afternoon on the trail no less. There were times I'd rather be on a highway with high winds, truck traffic and oversized loads. Then again, it was amusing to watch all the families and weekend warriors out for a ride. Then there was the pack of about 8 riders in full team kit that came barrelling through at 20+ mph. Not appropriate at all for the conditions on the trail. I wanted to reach out a smack them upside the head, but I decided to leave that for another day. The day got really frustrating at this point because I knew exactly where I was and how far I had to go and the section of trail through Lake Forest Park was full of tree roots to aggrevate the saddle sore I had developed. And low blood sugar because I could barely choke down any food. I took my usual stops at Kenmore (Tracy Owen Station) and Matthews Beach. There I ate a packet of Gu which my host family had given me before I left as I was quite out of it. From Matthews Beach onward it was really familiar territory. I had just crossed 55th Ave (I think, it's right near the Ronald McDonald House) and minding my own business I go down the trail. But there's this strange looking guy standing on the right side of the trail. It was my Dad! He was holding a sign that said ""Way to go Tim! You're almost home!"" and had a picture of a guy on a bike on it. It totally surprised the hell out of me especially because when I pitched the idea of the trip to my parents, well..., they didn't seem too enthusiastic about it. And not to mention the fact that I hadn't seen my dad about 4 months and he had lost about 80+ pounds by then. All I could say is ""Wow!"". Let me take a moment for a quick shout-out to my parents in case they ever read this. Congratulations you two on all the changes you have made. I'm so proud that you've stuck with it and that you continue to stick with it. Hopefully, I'll be able to support you as much as you have supported me. I had called my parents when I left my brother's place and my dad had been waiting for a while. We talked for a bit and took some pictures (The pictures are on Day #8, I'll move them over one of these days...). Then we agreed to meet at Golden Gardens for the Wheel Dipping. After that, I was flying. 15+ most of the way to Golden Gardens. I still don't know why but it was a combination of the trail starting downhill, seeing my dad in support of my trip and the Gu kicking in. I was flying. I got to Golden Gardens right quick, found my dad and then found my mom through help of our repective cell phones (the updated version of Marco Polo). I detached my trailer from the bike and left it on the path. It was a Saturday night, who'd want a trailer full of dirty underwear? ;-) At least I didn't have any drying on the outside... So the bike and I went down to the water. I dipped the front tire in and posed for pictures. We made our way back to the trailer and my mom offered me a ride (or at least a ride for my gear). I declined. C'mon, my whole goal was to ride home and well, what's the point if for the last 3 miles and a slight hill you ride in a car? We parted ways and I made it home in about 30 minutes which was pretty good considering what I was towing. When I got home, dinner was ready, the cat was ignoring me and I spent a good deal of time on the phone and email letting people know I made it home safe and sound."
373,"What a trip! After I got back, I took a few days off of the bike (actually, more than a few). I had plenty to do, much of which I didn't get around to right away. I had my pictures developed and due to ongoing computer problems of various sorts, haven't been able to post them yet. I've slowly (over 9 months or so) transcribed/written my journal pages here. In the Washington section, I am mostly writing them after the fact as I usually fell asleep quite quickly whenever I tried to write. Now that I've done one tour (solo, self-contained, camping), everybody asks if I would do it again. The answer is ""Yes, with some changes."" As I write this (July 2004) I'm in the midst of planning another ride home from Boise, though it might be a big detour/departure from last year's trip (thinking east then south then west then north - ""I'll be home for Christmas"", maybe). What would I do differently? 1. Train more. More hills. More long, uninterrupted by stoplight stretches. More riding with a loaded trailer. 2. Pack less/more and pack more efficiently. I had some extra weight I didn't need but some better raingear would've been nice. 3. Do a one day (or more) shakedown trip. Everybody else says to do one and I agree. I was basically flying by the seat of my pants hoping I didn't forget anything. 4. If I need new rings/cassette this year, I'd go for a lower range. I was ""bottoming out"" and still grunting up some hefty climbs. More spinning would be nice. 5. New tent. I had the $30 special that had been floating around the house for years ($15 for the tent and $15 for tarp/stakes). While it did it's job, I'd rather have something I could totally depend on in a storm. 6. Better communications for the road. This year I'm looking at a digital camera and the pocketmail system as I'm thinking my trip might be more than two weeks. Writing stuff down and then transcribing it was one of the reasons I'm just now finishing this journal. I love the CrazyGuy site and I figure by only having to do it once (and edit later, of course) I can keep up with it and be able to let people know where I am. 7. Ate too many greasy burgers & fries (and kept eating them). Sure they tasted great but they didn't sit well on the first steep hill after lunch. However, YMMV. What did I do right? 1. I took 2 full days off and a half day off. (Day 3, 6 & 11). I happened to be in great spots for these days and they more than made up for the lost time. 2. Only cycled in the dark once (Day 2) and I didn't repeat. I didn't care for it without my NiteRider system (I usually love riding at night). 3. Got well off the road quickly when the ""Oversize Load"" pace truck came past. And waved as they went by. ;-) 4. Didn't take offense when people called me crazy (though I've always taken it as a compliment). 5. Had my bike given a check before I left. The only problems I had were a few flat tires. And some of those were quite sneaky. 6. Dry, cleanish set of clothes for the end of the day. 7. Enjoyed myself and took it one day at a time. Most people, in their epilogue, write that they slowly get back into the daily grind. I did, to an extent that my day changes everyday. I threw myself into mounds of work that I had waiting, stopped riding and then the next thing I know, I'm back in Boise, riding, and getting excited about another trip. Go figure. Be safe out there! Wishing you tailwinds and courteous drivers,Tim"

376,"1. Wear a helmet. I've had to use mine a few times. Not fun. 2. If an ""Oversize Load"" pace truck passes you, get far off the road as quickly as you can. Usually they will try and move over but since they're oversize (usually in width), I don't take any chances. 3. Watch out for rumble strips. 4. Train. And train. And train some more. Specifically hills and the long, uninterrupted streches of highway between towns. Riding in the city, you're always up and moving but when you get to the country, you are more likely to stay in one position. 5. Move around on the bike. It helps fight off numbness and fatigue. 6. Eat before you're hungry, drink before you're thirsty and know that even though you haven't seen a car in 30 minutes, the moment you stop to pee, one will come by. 7. Have a backup plan. I had 3 people I could call, travelers checks, a can of chili in the bottom of my bag and iodine tablets. Luckily, I never had to use any of them. Be prepared. 8. Know the fire danger of where you'll be travelling and whether fires are allowed or not (likely not for the summer season). 9. Try and find the nearest bathroom before it gets dark. 10. Always carry TP. 11. When you plan your trip yourself, your total mileage will be about 10% more than you expected (I expected about 600+, clocked in at 759, so I was about 25% off). Then again, YOUR MILEAGE MAY VARY!!! ;-) sorry, I couldn't help it"

378,"1. WA 821 aka the Yakima River Canyon (Day 9) - Beautiful stretch of road from Yakima, WA to Ellensburg, WA. Traffic wasn't that bad, winds weren't a problem and the road was relatively flat but with enough up and downs to keep it interesting. I went through on a beautiful sunny afternoon and it didn't even feel like the 20 or so miles it was. Someone in my guestbook (Ben Staley - msg #2) suggested I take this and I'm glad I did. Thanks! 2. Reith Rd aka ""Old Pendleton River Road"" (Day 7) - Another beautiful canyon on my trip from Pendleton, OR to Echo, OR. Walls of rock tower above you on the right side (going west to Echo) and glimpses of the river are off to your left. Flatish with mild up and downs to keep life interesting. There's a few sections of railroad tracks and rocks/debris in the road (wear your helmet). Even though it started raining half of the way through and I wasn't quite sure it would end up in the right place, I had a great time. It's about 20+ miles with the mile markers counting down the distance to Echo. 3. Ukiah, OR to Pilot Rock, OR aka the cover for Bicycling's ""50 Great Fall Rides!"" (Day 7) - Well, it wasn't fall, but it sure felt that way. Starting from Ukiah, you have a few miles to warmup before you start climbing Battle Mountain up to the State Park (Day Use Only). From there, it's a fast level/downhill run until you reach Pilot Rock. The state park is beautiful and has some history about the lands and the Battle. The day was cool (about mid-50s to low-60s), cool enough for all my warmers and rain jacket and it felt like fall. When I got to Pilot Rock I sat down to french toast and Sunday afternoon football - and all felt right in the world. 4. Ellensburg, WA to Goldbar, WA aka I'll be biking over the mountains when I come (Days 10 & 12) - to further clarify, once you get to the juntion near Liberty and after you are done with the major downhill off of Steven's Pass. This whole route is heavily travelled but very beautiful. You climb 2 passes (Blewett & Stevens) and end up on the west side of the Cascades. Both passes are a long haul and don't get really steep until the last mile or so. Then it's a sweet downhill into Leavenworth (from Blewett) and Goldbar (from Stevens). On the west side of Stevens, the road gets narrow and the traffic gets heavy."
379,"The final manifestation of this disorder is that I have an obsession to drag my friends along on these cycling trips- often kicking and screaming. One such friend (Larry) whinges endlessly beforehand- but oddly enough really enjoys himself when he gets out. The other friend (Marsh) has become an ardent disciple worthy of any prophet- reach for a map and Marsh will instantly start plotting possible routes!! Marsh coined the phrase ""gentleman cyclists"" to differentiate us from those frenentic souls who rush from A to B on their machines and obviously have no need of therapy whatsoever (which is why we ride!!)      This trip originated because I had presented Larry with a rear rack for his bike (hint hint) and when I looked in my diary- this term was empty!! Well of bike rides anyway- a deficiency which needed rectifying!! The trip needed to be short and flat enough not to stress Larry (who breaks out in a sweat on the gentlest rises) and scenic enough to show Marsh some interesting views in country he had never seen before. So I opted for some of the Biggenden country which I have ridden several times but I still like very much.  Unfortunately in the early stages of planning Larry found he was needed elsewhere- so it seems it will be just Marsh and I. When I asked Marsh if he knew of a third person- he looked thoughtful for a moment- and then slowly shook his head. Hmmmmmm. A Biggenden Shire Council web article lists these spots in the Shire (snip)... MT WALSH NATIONAL PARK lies approximately 8 kilometres south of the township and has rugged cliffs and deep gorges. It is ideal for the very fit and experienced in bushwalking, mountaineering and rock climbing. There is an unofficial and unmarked walking track from the car park where there is a shelter shed, barbeque, toilet and cold shower facilities. COONGARRA ROCK AND FALLS is approximately 24 kilometres south of the township. Between Biggenden and Coalstoun Lakes is the turnoff to Coongarra Rock. This spectacular outcrop is a dry scrubby State Forest. The road goes to within a short distance of the base of the rock but climbing this should only be attempted by fit and experienced bushwalkers. The road to the falls branches off the road to Coongarra Rock and goes to within easy walking distance to the top of the falls. These roads can be particularly dangerous after heavy rain and should only be attempted at all times by experienced drivers in 4 Wheel Drive vehicles. COALSTOUN LAKES contains the smallest National Park in Queensland where there are two volcanic crater lakes surrounded by tea-trees and with an abundance of wildlife. The road in to the lakes is situated 3 kilometres on the Biggenden side of the township of Coalstoun Lakes. At the end of the road there is a walk of approximately 10 to 15 minutes. Under no circumstances should any attempt be made to drive to the summit, as the track is not trafficable to any vehicles including 4 Wheel Drives. THE BOTTLE TREE SCRUB is also situated at Coalstoun Lakes and can be found by turning along White Road beside the store at Coalstoun Lakes township. Ancient Bottle trees can be found in their original scrub, which has been preserved over the generations for all to enjoy. CHOWEY BRIDGE is a historic arched concrete railway bridge situated on the Gooroolba Road past the small township of Degilbo. The bridge, which was opened in 1905, has a 27 metre arch which was the first of its kind in Queensland. An interpretive plaque with photos of the bridge under construction is located at the picnic area with a barbeque available. MT WOOWOONGA AND MT GOONANEMAN are the mountains east of the town and have bushwalking tracks for the experienced bushwalkers. There are barbeque facilities, shelter shed with bench seats and water available. The main walk takes 5 to 6 hours and is not a circuit and should only be undertaken by experienced bushwalkers. ...(snip) Several of these could be covered in one straightforward circuit with only a couple of minor deviations. The locations south of Biggenden (Coongarra Rock, Coulston Lakes and Bottle Tree Scrub) would make another good weekend ride. I have a bad habit of vectoring in too much for any given day- which seems to upset friends considerably!! So this time I will measure distances from scales much more closely and plan more thoroughly. Check this  map  out- look for Biggenden (centre on x axis and bit below centre on y axis) and zoom in so Biggenden is in bottom right corner. Ride roughly defined from Dallarnil (north of Biggenden) west around Coringa Rd (near new Paradise Dam on the Burnett River) down to railway line- Chowey Bridge (umarked) slightly west of where Coringa Rd ends, then back east along railway to Degilbo and Biggenden,then out to Mt Walsh and return, then north up Old Woowoonga Rd (unmarked) slightly east of highway and parallel would take us past Mt Woowoonga and Mt Goonaneman (not marked) back to Dallarnil. A possible circuit would read thus 26 ks Dallarnil to Cooringa and Chowey Bridge- Dallarnil to Cooringa follows along scenic ridges with great views of    farming country and many many hillsCooringa to Chowey Bridge- (on Biggenden-Gayndah railway) less hilly- last 3.5 ks into Chowey rutted dirt over several low hills17 ks     Chowey Bridge back to Biggenden- via Degilbo following road/railway line15 ks   out to Mt Walsh to camp the night and return- also some bushwalking while we are there20 ks   return to Dallarnil via Old Woowoonga Rd- no time to climb Woowoonga-Goonanemen but if time spare could call into the reserve at the base of the Woowoonga for a breather as we almost pass it."
380,                
381,"What was that famous statement- the world will end with a  whimper and not with a bang? Or was it the other way around? Certainly this trip ended with a big bang- with lots of little whimpers along the way. Let's not also forget alleged fire opals;  map and compass; thin bike tyres and thick tractor tube;  a ride in a conspicuous Government car; angel hair pasta; and hills, hills, hills.  Saturday morn 2? August dawned bright and clear as I frantically grabbed the last of my gear and hurled it into the car as I rushed off to pick up Marsh. From memory- I made it on time-just. Of course someone as early as Marsh- ontime really equates with late- for me ontime is actually quite early!! At least there were no last-minute family wedding phone calls this time and we were soon on our way for Dallarnil. I am always amazed how long it takes me to load my bike at our kick-off point- maybe I need to practice more!! Finally we had everything in place and off we rode.        We didn't get far- one kilometre out on the hill overlooking the town where the Emu Ck Rd and Coringa Rd branch. I was taking a photo of Marsh under the signs (with Mt Appallan in the background) when a local pulled up for a yarn. After filling us in on much local lore-with a conspiratorial air he pulled out a couple of boxes from  the car. It seems he has found a good patch of opal and he is sure it is fire opal- currently awaiting appraisal. Certainly the jewellery made from it is beautiful.     We finally got on the road again and revelled in the scenery of the surrounding hills as we rode along the ridges. Well all except when it came to pushing up the hills!! One spot about half way to Coringa there is a particularly high curved ridge with spectacular views for many miles. Marsh fished out his RACQ map and I my el cheapo  orienteering compass from Warehouse. Might have only been $4 but seems to work well enough. Identified Mt Perry (mountain not the town), North  and South peaks and others.      As we approached the Coringa turn from the Burnett dam road I saw our  car approaching. Hmmm- what now?? Turns out we had hardly left when the  kids decided to take Lyn's brother out for a spin- he sat on a packet  of bacon I had left behind. Ooops- some of our tea. The ride down  through Coringa was uneventful for a while- until a marked whooshing sound was heard from the threadbare back tyre. So much for economy. Luckily as I was examining the damage the farmer belonging to the gate  behind us pulled up. He brought me a piece of tractor tube which sleeved the tyre nicely and I patched the tube. Before long we were rolling again heading for the Biggenden-Gayndah railway line. Once we reached the road which parallels the line (but a few ks away- rarely see the line) we turned right for the Chowey Bridge turn.      One marked feature of riding in this country is the hills- not very high even by Australian standards- but numerous and steep following  the contours of the landscape with very little cut and fill. As we turned left onto the dirt for Chowey Bridge I realised the hills were taking their toll on us so we stopped for lunch on the side of the road.  As we finished I saw a car on the horizon- heading for the bridge. This was an answer to prayer- we'd decided to skip the bridge and head straight back to Biggenden. Problem was we were about out of water and needed to fill our bottles at Chowey Bridge. Not only did the driver volunteer to fill our water bottles- Marsh got a ride to see the bridge in a car he would never normally ride in (enuff said??)  The ride back to Biggenden was pleasant and uneventful- particularly after we got out of the hills. At Degilbo Hall we found a middle-aged rock-n-roll group in practise- and were they good!! We were glad to reach Biggenden and made a beeline for the cafe and a recuperative Cappucino. Marsh toddle over the road to the Grand Hotel for a recuperative bottle of port- and then off to the local campground for night, rather than the original plan of riding to Mt Walsh to camp.      Biggenden Campground beside the Showgrounds is a pleasant green oasis overlooking Mt Walsh (the whole district overlooks Mt Walsh!!) with good facilities including a well-lit camp kitchen with barbecue. No wash-up sink so Marsh's tub came in handy!!    We slept well and before long packed up and headed off for the Mt Woowoonga Rd- and more hills!!           Not far out of town it was interesting to find the site of the original Degilbo settlement at Baxter's Crossing (long before Biggenden was thought of- Degilbo had its origins in the Cobb and Co coaches of the 1860's- Biggenden only came to life in the early 1900's when the railway came through).  We eventually passed off the bitumen and were almost to Woowoonga Hall on the dirt when my back wheel suddenly felt ""off""- I had barely stopped when a reverberating detonation from right behind me signalled the end of the rear tyre and tube combo. I had a spare tube but no tyre- time for a sag out. Luckily we were within mobile range and only a few kilometres from our son's place- so I called for the ""sag wagon"" and then we walked for Woowoonga Hall where we unloaded the bikes in readiness for our pick-up. When my son turned up we took the ""long way"" back to his place and checked out the lookout near Mt Woowoonga we had planned to ride up (Marsh was so disappointed he had missed out on that hill- not!!)         On the way home we stopped in Childers to check out the historic main street and enjoy one last cappucino. Particularly poignant was visiting the memorial and art gallery in the top floor of the old Palace Backpackers. My eldest son picked fruit as a backpacker for several seasons and it could have just as easily been him lost in that on that fire 23rd of June, 2000 along with the other young people.        An interesting weekend- but still a good one. I learnt that I can't run tyres till they show canvas!! and I also learnt to be flexible and change plans when circumstanes require- some serendipity is very commensurate with the goals of leisure cycling!!
"
382,"  Last Christmas a work colleague found himself down at a local cycle shop purchasing his own Christmas present- a brand-new crossbike with rear pannier rack. He often rode to work in earlier years and then became interested in my touring photos. We ride fairly often on a Saturday morning so I guess it was natural I should convince him he try a weekend ride. My wife and I have visited the Mary Valley several times and I have been itching to ride it for some time. Imbil is only about 40ks from Gympie, the country is reasonably level (mostly!) so it was a logical choice I felt for a beginning ride. From memory attractions I would like to visit include following the heritage railway line Mary Valley Rattler and its sidings as much as possible; the Ammamoor State Forest where the Music Muster is held annually; visit the dam on Little Yabba Creek and camp downstream at Little Yabba at the Island Reach (telephone 07 5484 5247); the original terminus of the Mary Valley Railway is actually several kilometres south at Brooloo- and the bell bird reserve there is well worth a visit. Some good websites on Imbil are     Cooloola Regional Development Bureau's Imbil pages ;  Dennis Amor's caravan pages  also GDay Pubs site  has some great pics of Imbil.              Sunday May 9- email from John at ""Island Reach""- ""We do have a camp kitchen ... Hire canoes are still available. And the price for camping is still $5 per adult per night. Had some bike riders in a couple of weeks ago. They used our place as a ride base and rode 68 ks one day, they thought it was great..."" many thanks John and looking forward to camping there. Thursday 6 May- maps arrived from Info Centre at Kybong- excellent- plenty of detail- even if it is a cute picture type map it has all the interesting spots we are looking for and all the necessary roads- excellent. Promises to be a great weekend. Comes in brochure ""Mary Valley- Bush Behind the Beach""- ask for it at Cooloola Info Centre if you need it- 1800 number below. Great brochure. Have emailed   Island Reach Camp Ground  - seems to have camp kitchen, canoe hire etc as well as camp spots Wednesday 5 May still no email answer from Info Centre at Kybong- finally rang there on 1800 444 222- Beth was a great help and is posting an assortment of stuff- hopefully the map will have enough detail. Friday 30 April 2004- emailed  Cooloola Tourist Info  office at Matilda Kybong (business listings/tours,travel cruises/travel and tourism info centres) for maps and info"
383,"My wife wasn't overly thrilled about it;  however she was pleased to see the bike removed from the dining room where it had been parked over the last 2 days as the load was assembled and secured.  Now it only took minutes to ease the bike out the front door and park it in the drive...Dave is picking me up at 6.30am for the drive to Gympie and the ride into the Mary Valley. Only 45 minutes to wait.  Dave had first whetted my appetite for cycle touring with his trip last year   Brooweena to Tiaro . He showed me the photos and I new I wanted to do it too. In September I put a bike on lay-buy;  paid it off just after Christmas.  Next I saved up to buy knicks, water bottle mounts, riding gloves, panniers, bungee straps, bike pump.  Before Easter this year, Dave had the proposed Mary Valley trip dangled in front of my face;  I signed on with enthusiasm. 6.40am....Dave overdue......6.55am.....checking diary and morning newspaper -- times and dates correct.  7.05am,  I phone, and Dave's wife tells me he is on his way. After loading my bike onto the bike rack, Dave says he has mobile-phone business to do, so I drive his '88 Fairlane to Gympie.  As we drive, Dave fills me in on how his son is to be married in the next couple of hours in Czechoslovakia,  and how his lateness is due to attempts to phone Europe.  In Gympie,  we park the car at George's house and set about loading our bikes. About 9.45am we are finally ""on the road"".     I am in the lead as we turn onto the Mary Valley Highway, probably because I am the ""green"" one.  Leaving the city limits we ride pass houses on acreage -- large expanses of lawn with shrublined driveways.  Some people like to spend much of their leisure hours riding ride-on lawnmowers.  The Mary Valley is lush undulating farming country with light local traffic.  We ride up and down gentle grades with me huffing and puffing and Dave talking 15 to the dozen.  Soon the country opens up and we can see over dairy farms and crops to the Beenaam Range to the East.       Stopping for another drink, a car pulls over and stops.  Out gets Ted with whome we are to have morning tea at his house several K's further on.  The morning is getting old, but Dave and Ted chat for about 25 minutes. Back on the bikes we eventually come to the turn-off to Dagun. Dagun is about 300 metres from the highway,  and we can hear a banjo and whistle in the distance, as we come over the crest of a hill. The Dagun station comes in view.     A craft and produce market is underway. There is also a sign advertising wine tasting, which catches my interest.  Some locals arrive to open the goods shed and inform us that they are getting ready for the arrival of the Mary Valley Rattler, a steam driven train run by volunteers on the weekend hyperlink.  Dave gets pretty excited about the news of the train, and gets his digital camera out for its imminent arrival, leaving me to investigate the wine tasting.  The $15 port is reasonable value, so one goes into the pannier.       A local, Chris, introduces himself to us asking after our plans.  He has ridden a bike across Germany to England and up into Scotland.  He kindly offers us the chance to refill our waterbottles from his rainwater tank, which we do.  Leaving Dagun for Ted's house and morning tea, Dave's front rack collapses into his frontwheel.  Dave is wrestling it back into place when Ted and his wife Shirley  drive up.  As we were long overdue, they drove out to locate us.  The front panniers are loaded into the car, and once again we set off for Ted's and Shirley's house.  Shirley has a bowl of ""revive-the-dead"" lamb and vegetable soup ready when we arrive.  Just the thing to wash down the sandwiches that Dave has brought for us both.    Over a cup of tea, Shirley relates how the Valley used to be called the Emerald Valley as it always seems to be green.Ted and Shirley's house looks Southeast over the Mary Valley. Dave and Ted dismantle the rack on the front of Dave's bike,  and Ted offers to drop the gear it carried at the Imbil camping ground where we plan to overnight photo.      Loads re-allocated, watered and fed, Dave and I set off down hill towards Amamoor, where lo and behold, the Mary Valley Rattler is due any minute.  The Amamoor locals, like their neighbours back up the road, have a refreshment stall, this time with tea and coffee and sausages on the BBQ hoto.  It is a rare sight these days to see a loco being turned on a turntable;  a rare treat to see it done by hand, as happens here.      With the train seen off again, back on the road,  and some wonderful views to be seen over pineapple farms from the crests of hills.      As the day is getting late, and the temperature dropping as the sun drops lower in the sky, it is a mixed blessing to find that the road to Imbil is now mostly downhill -- i.e. we get there quicker, but with little need for peddling to keep us warm. It is easy to find the Island Reach Camping Ground at Imbil --cross the Yabba Creek bridge, turn left and the entry is about 80metres further on.the left.   Dave and I have about 5 acres of ground from which to choose a spot, as the other 6/7 resident vans  are huddled over in one corner.  Being adventurous, we decide to camp 3 metres from the Camp kitchen Its about this time that I discover that Dave carries his tent on his front rack, and that is in Ted's car.  The sun is down, and the temperature is too, when Ted suddenly appears out of the gloom.  The tent is erected by the light of a 3/4 moon and a torch.  Dave cooks up a couple of steaks on his portable gas burner,  and then I make one of the worst instant macaroni cheeses I have ever had.  Dave is generous in his condolences.  Following a cup of tea, the port goes down a treat.  Dave is phoning his son in Czechoslavakia at 8.00p.pm. so after phoning my answering machine (the family is out consoling themselves in my absence), I put myself to bed. The following morning Dave is up good and early.  Me?  I sleep until about 8.30a.m. Over breakfast we plan a trip to see (and hear) the bellbirds about 1.5K's south of Imbil.     .   As you do, we exchange greetings with another Camp resident, Elliott.  After breakfast, Elliott returns with his wife, Lynn, who is a Deputy Principle of a nearby secondary school photo.  About an hour and a half later after much stimulating exchange about schools. kids, touring and backgrounds, Dave and I farewell Elliott and Lynn as we all need to pack. South from Imbil is an area of native forest inhabited by bellbirds.    As we ride into the forest, we come across a sequence of signs that follow some version of human logic:       Riding back into Imbil, we spot the local station and decide to have a closer look.  Guess what -- the Mary Valley Rattler is due.  I hear a greeting and discover Elliott and Lynn sitting on a log reading the Sunday papers, also awaiting the MVR.          After seeing the MVR off again, we farewell Imbil, and setoff on the Mary Valley Highway for Gympie -- 38K's to go.        I am apprehensive about arriving in Gympie after dusk, so I am in the lead once more, and although Dave sees many interesting sights, I am uninclined to stop for long. The sun is resting on the horizon when Dave and I roll our bikes down the driveway at George's in Gympie,  and after a leisurely unpacking of bikes and donning of warmer clothes, and recounting of our trip to George, Dave drives us back to Hervey Bay to end my first taste of bicycle touring. Prologue The richness of the experience of the 2 day bicycle tour was the biggest surprise.  The fact that over the 2 days I rode a bike 80 - 90 kms (further than ever before) did not stand out as significant.  Rather, the conversations with Dave, with strangers, with the Progress Association people, and the chance to take in grand views and examine old buildings from the road -- these were the highlights. I came to 2 conclusions about cycling and hills:  unlike riding in a car, on a bicycle you can enjoy the view of both sides of the hill;  and the hill on the other side is always steeper.  Or so it seemed to these unseasoned pair of legs. Bring on the next tour!!
"
384,May the adventure begin!!
385,"     We were hardly on the road when a cyclist older than us and very fit rode past- and of course we stopped to yak. He and his wife had sold their house on the Gold Coast to tour Australia some years ago- and were now building in Gympie as they decided to settle back into suburbia again. We met him again next day on the Traveston road.     Progress was good- with improved physical condition we were riding many more hills right to the top- and in no time we were  in Dagun.         It was pleasing to see considerable refurbishments being carried out on the Dagun Railway Station. So back out to the highway and looking for the Ammamoor turn (the Dagun-Amamoor road has nasty roller-coaster hills- then again- some of the hills on the highway turn to Amamoor weren't too good either!) Amamoor is a reasonable size little town famous for the  Country Music Muster every August attracting tens of thousands of people to a huge weekend in the Amamoor State Forest.  As we rode into Amamoor I lost speed and found myself on the wrong (down camber) side of a turn- a lunge on the pedals to get  myself moving around the corner produced a noticeable wrenching sensation on the back wheel. Hmmm.        After lunch we headed out of town for Kandanga- and somehow things didn't seem right on the hills. I was really struggling to make headway- were the sandwiches THAT heavy? and something was rubbing on the back tyre. Closer inspection revealed the  back wheel was rather loose- and removing the back wheel found very loose cones and a bent axle. Errrk!! I had noticed a garage (in the old fashioned sense of the word) in Amamoor so hoping for a miracle we turned back. Couldn't pedal but at least it was  mostly downhill and I coasted back in. Bill the mechanic was helpful- but unable to do anything. A mobile windscreen repairman was working out the back- and willing to take me back to Gympie- and a quick phone call back to the LBS I had visited that  morning established the wheel could be repaired. So hiho off to Gympie we shall go.        If ever you need bike work done around Gympie- go to Pedal Power Plus in Mary St. Mark is experienced and most helpful. As he stripped the hub down he showed this newby how it all went together- and what regular maintenance is needed. Before long he had new axle and bearings in- and all at a very reasonable price. Thanks heaps mate. I started walking back around 5pm and I was hoping someone finishing work living up the Valley would pick me up. Course as  Marsh said- picture a middle-age guy in bike knicks and carrying a bike wheel trying to thumb a lift!! Needless to say the respectable middle-class middle age crew just drove past- couldn't really blame 'em. Finally a young fella driving an older Holden and towing a trailer pulled up- thanks Tom. He was pretty keen on Holdens and told me about four he owned/had  interests in. I could see some lively discussions ensuing with my Ford mad sons around the same age! Tom dropped me at the Amamoor store- and then the fun started finding Marsh. Bill had told me on the phone as I was  leaving Gympie that Marsh was taking my gear down the creek to set up camp. I was checking the creek around the picnic area not realising the creek swung around and bordered the recreation grounds near the rail bridge also. Finally someone in the  store set me right (isn't the idea of stealth camping supposed to be that no-one knows you are there?) and Marsh and I met halfway  down the rec ground road in the gloom of dusk. After all the hassle of transferring two people's gearand pitching two tents he had decided burgers were a good option for tea and I heartily agreed. Our impromptu camp spot though short on facilities (rec ground toilet block was locked) was very pleasant- camped as we were under the stars on thick grass with the lights of town several hundred yards away. Sleep wasn't long in coming- and we woke to the enjoyable sight of sun rising over the hills.
"
386,"  Mountains around and the road continuing on down to the creek. After brewing a quick cuppa we sauntered down the road to the creek. I took several pics of the steel and concrete railway bridge and the view up the creek before we ambled back for brekky and pack.        We could see the rear doors of the garage open and I set off with the wheel. In no time I was back with a working bike and we took off for Traveston. Bill had suggested taking the Amamoor-Bruce Highway road and then the Traveston road which meant only one kilometre or so of highway riding. So we faced the same hills as yesterday again- only now in reverse! As we crossed the Mary Valley highway one chap working on his ute called out to try the swimming hole just over the hill- turn left before the bridge. OK!!     Well we did- and found ourselves watching a couple in flagrante dilecto in a utility!! oops- time to turn around and hit the road again.    Shortly after the Mary River bridge we met our cycling friend again- and then this unreal hill with 12% grade up and 14% grade down. I cracked 68ks/hr  coming down that hill. Riding the Bruce Highway wasn't too traumatic with the wide shoulders and soon we turned for Traveston.        Although the road was narrow it was pleasant riding and the hills from this side were a manageable steady long pull. Cooran was only a few kilometres along and it is a very pleasant little town.       We enjoyed a good lunch at the local restaurant and I was particularly interested to see Col Sheehan's photographic work hanging around the walls. Col has a studio nearby where he produces photographic prints ranging from the work of Frank Meadow Sutcliffe of Whitby in North Yorkshire, England to prints of his own. I first ""met"" Colin via email when Net searching for ""Cooran"" some time ago.  Colin's site is well-worth checking out both for his framed photographic prints- and for Colin!!     Cooran can also pride itself on its magpies- I was repeatedly bombed by one that made a Stuka  dive bomber seem tame by comparison. It would dive screaming so loudly my ears rang and it really tried hard to get past my helmet and cap to get a piece of me!! The next leg to Pomona was also short and again mostly pleasant. The last 3ks were on the Pomona- Kin Kin Rd which was rather busy.     We soon found the Showgrounds turn and set up camp- no tables etc for a second night but there was a long power pole lying on the ground which made an excellent seat;  a wood-fired barbecue and toilet block nearby.  Marsh had his eye on Mt Cooroora on the edge of town- for decades now the annual KIng of the Mountain race sees many hopeful runners pound up and down the steep hill hopeful of winning the crown. As we climbed up this steep mountain several guys thundered past down hill- at least one of them a footballer build that made me look flimsy- must have been in training for King of the Mountain race.  I was feeling decidedly ""off"" while we were setting up camp and as we cycled to the foot of the mountain that feeling intensified. I sat down at the foot of the mountain with massive chest pains- which don't seem cardiac in origin- if I can get massive quantities of wind up the pain subsides and I suddenly come good again. I think it is early stages of hiatus hernia or something similar. After several minutes of being a total pig unabashedly belching explosively (while Marsh stared up the mountain and whistled ""Land of Hope and Glory"") the desired relief suddenly materialised and away we went.      We scrounged around for some fallen firewood and Marsh excelled himself with culinary brilliance. Pasta and sauce with bacon through it.     After a couple of days on the road a hot shower was very welcome- and probably others close by thought the same. I had made sure I had a good change of clothes packed- Marsh and I were off to the movies- silent movies!! Ron at the Majestic Theatre has been running silent movies for nearly twenty years- complete with accompaniment from a true-blue theatre pipe organ- the only one in a theatre in Queensland now. The show starts at 8am with drinks and nibblies in the foyer- then ""The Son of the Sheik""complete with organ backing- and the night finished with coffee and cake. An unforgettable experience. We were pretty tired from a big day and after a leisurely walk back to camp we slept pretty soundly.
"
387,"  Next morning we packed up and headed back to the Majestic Theatre to see Ron some more and check out the organ.         An unreal experience- after a forty year wait I finally had heard a theatre pipe organ played in a theatre to accompany a silent movie. What's more I had the chance to play one (even if I wasn't world beating!!)     Marsh finally brought me back to reality with a time call- and Ron presented me with some of his publicity pics which I greatly appreciated.  Ron's website is well worth checking out. Marsh had decided to return pretty much the way we came- except after Traveson we would take the Tandur turn along the railway line which would take us back to Matilda Servo at Kybong. Marsh had a theory that a road along a railway line would share the gradient of the railway line. Hate to say it but boy was this theory waaay off-course. The railway was levelled out with cut and fill and road followed the natural contours of the landscape!! As we reached the last hill before Kybong Marsh noticed the rear tyre rapidly deflating- and the last few hundred metres into Kybong we had to walk. As always Matilda was busy- but a cup of coffee and a bite to eat was in order before heading home. I made a quick call into the camping shop in Gympie to buy one of their lightweight sleeping bags I had seen for only $20- and then Marsh caught up on lost sleep!! The family said the traffic down that day had been appalling so I turned in at Gunalda and showed everyone an inland route from Gunalda to Tiaro including Dickabram Bridge- very scenic but Marsh slept soundly through it all.

389,"After Melissa asked me to accompany her I had the inspiration to ride my bicycle home from the camp as long as Melissa had company from one, or both, of the nieces.  Dana twisted her ankle badly a week into her trip and had to come off trail so she opted to take the bus to the Twin Cities with her group and was able to telephone that decision to us early on.  The campers returned to camp on the 22nd  so we wouldn't know Emily's plans until we arrived at Widji.  Also we may not see Emily until the banquet and festivities that takes place at the end of these trips with friends and family who were able to be at Widji that evening.   We assumed she would accompany Melissa back to the cities and talk canoes all the way back.  Melissa had done many years of these trips including a  several weeks in the Canadian Northwest Territories following rivers to Hudson Bay.  If Emily and Dana chose to return to the cities on the bus leaving Melissa alone I would return with Melissa.  Emily and Dana stay at Grandpa and Grandma Stockwell's home in St. Paul before and after camp Widji as both have out of state homes. So in anticipation of the bike ride I brought my Trek 7500, BOB trailer, and probably too much gear for the 300 mile trip.  The trip was exciting to plan but the reality was not so exciting as the day of departure from Widji arrived.  My mind was full of hours on a bike with headwinds, hills, rain, it's slow, can be lonely, sweat, no bed, bad coffee, & missing Mary (wife).  And a ride home in the truck does have some attraction.  Even the night before the ride I was undecided until the campers, as part of the evening program, were invited to talk about their experiences on trail.  The campers talked of self confidence in themselves from just doing it.  Last year's 14 day tour of northeast Minnesota was my first unsupported ride that also came down to 'just do it'.  So it was the young people who inspired (shamed?) me to get over it and bike! So, the adventure begins  ..
"
390,"Every piece of water (river, lake, pond, bog) is a low spot.  In other words, up and down, up and down, for 40 miles.  No hill was long, nor as steep as Echo Trail from Widji, but with a 25 to 30mph headwind and many pounds of gear - it was work.  The weight of your gear is obvious and the parachute effect can be substantial - panniers, trailer, tent and sleeping bag, and yeah, the wide biker.  Can't complain about Earl; there is no wind resistance - he is as flat as road kill.  There was enough wind to require me to pedal downhill.  Hwy. 1 is well worth the trials as it is a lovely scenic road with many places and reasons to stop and be a tourist.  This section was the most difficult of the trip.    There are no shoulders, but as I have discovered the last few years, motorists of all sizes treat bicycles with respect.  On one hill a large truck followed me until there was room to pass; no shoulder, and oncoming traffic kept him right behind me.  I would love to have taken a photo through my rear view mirror as all I saw was the grill and part of the bumper, and with the big diesel engine rattling away - awesome! If I stopped suddenly or fell over I would probably be as flat as Earl. One longer hill with a blind corner that hid the top of the hill had me stop part way up to allow the traffic to pass. One good turn for another. Time in the saddle isn't all romance and adventure.  Bike touring for me is not  boring but sometimes time drags by uneventfully.  It is not long before one tree begins to look much the same as any other and the silence isn't all it's cracked up to be.  Sorry about that environmentalists.  Give me a boom box, aarrrgghhh!  (sounds like Howard Dean)  I really need to find a weatherproof bicycle radio. Fortunately my traveling companion was Earl the Dead Kitty, but being dead, he wasn't much for talking.   The upside was Earl didn't eat and I didn't need a litter box.  The tent and sleeping bag were inside a contractors trash bag strapped to the top of the BOB trailer giving Earl a comfortable riding and listening position.  I began to question my sanity when I found myself talking to Earl about the $*?\+@> wind in my face, and making comments and observations to him.   Earl was given to me by my son Derek, oh, 12 or more years ago.  It's hard to remember exactly as Earl isn't one to be noticed much.  I mean, no food, water, litter box, and he doesn't whine to go outside.  I do occasionally find him sunning himself on the loveseat in our south facing bay window.  The other cats hiss at him to leave the prized place in the sun but being dead he doesn't react much.  Only PsychoKitty takes advantage of the situation by using Earl as a soft pillow.  Earl has a decidedly perverse sense of humour as he has been known to lie in the curve of our long drive when we are expecting company.  This is incredibly effective to startle the car driver as the headlights pick up Earl's prone position at the last minute.  Over the years of cycling I have heard from unenlightened individuals with mullet hair cuts, reversed ball caps, and bad teeth that bicycles have no right on the roads because we don't pay road tax.  We benefit from the nice roads, campgrounds, parks, and facilities, provided by others is the argument.  Well, not exactly true is it?  I pay my share of taxes through my motor vehicles, income, sales taxes, and property taxes (& etc.!).  This thought process moves into pondering about the 'Adventure' of bicycling on paved roads (most of the time), where there is water, food, and shelter available.  It is definitely possible to have an Adventure if equipment fails, or I suffer a personal injury through accident or illness.  But come on, is this really dangerous?  Were the early explorers of this area more heroic?  Well, yes, actually they were!  But the voyageurs, missionaries and settlers must have had some help from friendly Americans.  I'm going to assume that food and shelter, tho' more difficult than now, were available.  So, I too, take advantage of the 'natural' world in a more modern America.  Widji's canoe campers too, had maps, designated campsites, and access to emergency help if needed, but yes, there is certainly Adventure.  Ever try to paddle a canoe against the wind?  Portage a 17 foot canoe, 60 or 70 pounds dead weight (food & gear) for 100 yards or a mile or more?  What if I swamp?  What if it is raining and we eat cold food?  Big storms?  Mosquitoes and flies?  What if I am homesick?  Oh yeah, Adventure.  So with profound thoughts and Earl keeping me company I pedal on. In planning a route for this trip I had two options.  I could stay on Hwy. 1 south to Hwy 61 or I could turn southwest onto county road 2 that would take me    more directly to Two Harbors.  Hwy 1 would be on a familiar road as I biked it last year going north as far as Cty 2 where I caught a ride from there to Ely.  Only after biking a road may one know the details well!  Wildhurst near Finland is a very nice campground with a super host/owner that I stayed in on last years ride.  Finland has a grocery store and there are 3 or 4 campgrounds near, or on, Hwy 61.  There is comfort knowing where you will spend the night and a shower is nice too.  However it would still be into the wind and Two Harbors/Duluth would take an extra day instead of one if I traveled Cty 2.   A wind will dehydrate me quickly and I ran out of water some miles before the intersection of Hwy. 1 and Cty. 2.  There are 2 homes and a roadhouse (closed) at this location.  There was someone home at one house and I was able to have my water bottles filled.   At the intersection was a state rest stop with only a pit toilet - no water and no picnic table.  I huddled in the lee of the 'facilities' for a lunch of peanut butter on tortillas.  I have discovered the hard way, of course, that you can crush regular sandwich bread but not tortillas.  It's crummy peanut butter compared to the natural pb I prefer but it doesn't need refrigeration and it comes in a plastic jar.  I also telephoned Mary on my cell phone (Adventure?) to let her know that I am taking Cty. 2 to Two Harbors (way too many toos).   Cty. 2 moved the wind more to the left shoulder which was an important reason for the decision.  Both Hwy 1 from here to Hwy. 61 and Cty. 2 are long rolling terrain which makes for nice bicycling.  I much more prefer roads and I'm not  fond of converted railroad rights of way - multi-purpose trails - as they are way flat which puts constant pressure on my butt and hands.  The wind moved around as does the direction of the road so there was still enough headwind for a demanding ride.  As I approached Two Harbors the road straightened out and  the final 12 miles was new pavement.  Joy!  The smoother the pavement the less friction.  The last few miles to Two Harbors was downhill too!  Am I living right or what?  That kind of finish to a long day in the saddle makes any hardship disappear.  Lake Superior was off in the distance for a long time and such a vista is unusual in the Midwest unless you count miles and miles and miles of straight road lined alternately with corn and soybean as 'vista'.      I camped at the city campground near the corner of Cty. 2 and Hwy 61 ending a 75 mile day.  I considered going a few more miles but could not get a firm answer to possible camping ahead.  When you are on a bike you had best take the available when it is presented.  I have learned (the hard way of course) that there is a big difference between car miles and bike miles.  'Just up the road' can be a long way indeed.               I placed my tent near the main road through the campground with my bike and trailer visible.  Who needs TV when you can talk to your fellow travelers?  A bonus was a large patch of raspberries behind my tent that attracted a number of children; some were shy but many were very talkative!  The world is full of great people, indeed.  Off to bed to read for a while and dream of tail winds and downhills."
391,"It was raining slightly as I left Two Harbors at 7:30a.m.  I planned to ride the scenic highway between Two Harbors and Duluth.  I noted for future Adventures that there are campgrounds for only a couple of miles beyond Two Harbors on Old Hwy. 61 the Scenic Drive.  The drizzle stopped early but remained overcast which is ideal biking weather.  I had burned my lower lip yesterday, even with sunblock chapstik, and not for the first time either.  Kinda gross when the lips begin to peel.  Hwy. 61 from Duluth to Grand Marais (that's as far as I have been)is never far from Lake Superior.  Bicycling beside the big lake is interesting as you pass a section of road with no trees between you and the lake the air temperature drops significantly enough to consider frost bite!  Seagulls and a rocky shoreline remind me of the east and west coast.  The lake is large enough for the far shore to be unseen and is COLD!      At Knife River, which is near to half way to Duluth, the amount of new home construction was obvious.  The wilderness shrinks.  I must admit tho' that I would buy up here and then lobby for no more construction of course. East Duluth was busy and the shoulders were narrow and debris covered.  I am  thankful for no flat tires and the forethought to have purchased two new Kevlar lined (spendy) tires a few days before I left for this trip.  Once onto Londin Road beyond the access to Interstate 35 the traffic almost disappeared.  Biking through downtown Duluth was fun as you are slow enough to sightsee.  A bank thermometer at 10:30a.m. displayed 51 degrees.  I stopped at 'Jitters' Coffee Shop to get directions to the Duluth end of the Willard Munger Trail and have a nice latte instead of the instant coffee I punish myself with when on the road.  I usually buy something when I stop for water so bike tourers aren't  perceived as freeloaders.  After enjoying real coffee off I go to find Willard Munger (and his son hee, hee). Riding through Duluth was a fun part of the ride.  Duluth is not so big that bicycling is dangerous nor does it appear so.  Even in this lower elevation part of Duluth the city is one of big views of Lake Superior, the harbour, industry, and rocky bluffs.  As I moved into West Duluth I encountered light industry showcasing architecture spanning all the years of the cities history and thoroughly enjoyed myself.  The roads and some buildings could use a face lift but it was so much like the Hamilton Ontario of my pre-teen years I gave myself up to full Nostalgia.  I missed a turn or two but who cares?  It's all part of The Adventure.        Onto the Trail and biking between rocks billions of years old to Carlton Minnesota 16 miles up the trail. I took a break in Carlton and guess who I meet?  Willard Munger's Son!  We had a nice chat and shared our ride stories.  Much fun.

  I was so engrossed in the moment I forgot to fill my water bottles.  From here on tho' towns are 5 or 6 miles apart so no problem.  After 85 miles I camp at the Moose Lake City Park.
"
392,"  Earl needed to be protected from the mist as did my eyeglasses which needed to come off.  The air was so saturated water drops formed on my leading edges.  For the first time in a long while I removed my helmet and only used my sweatband. The helmet vents were acting like a rain trap and funneling the water down my neck and face. I was thankful to be on a trail after Monday's wind and not being able to see much detail without my eyeglasses was not a problem.  All I needed to do was follow the car free, hazard free, hill free, wind free, asphalt trail (the weird thought of yellow bricks?).  I came upon several people out walking their dogs and one lone, loaded bike tourer heading north.   I arrived in Willow River at 8a.m. just as their mercantile was opening and finally Earl was noticed.  The owner of the store laughed at the appropriateness of road kill on a road trip and went on to say that his son attending college in Montana has a life size Scooby Doo that travels with him on his drive between home and college.  Made perfect sense to him.  And I didn't forget my coffee. Hinkley is the southern end of the Willard Munger Trail but I found Old Hwy 61 is mostly straight and in good repair with brand new asphalt for several miles into Pine City  oh so smooth.  I just did not want peanut butter again so I stopped at a DQ for a chile dog & onion rings before leaving Pine City.  Poor choice of cycling food (burp). The sun broke through about noon but so did the winds (headwind of course), but there's not much in the way of hills.  But what can you do?  I keep on pedaling and enjoy the moment. I had planned to stop around North Branch for the night, and began looking for a campground long before then.  At water stops I asked for information on possible campgrounds up ahead but struck out.  In Harris I was greeted by a fabulous smile just for asking for water!  In North Branch I stopped at a Real Estate office to inquire about campsites and wouldn't you know it the fellow was brand new and couldn't help. Once at North Branch I kept on going, and going, and going, eventually passing the Energizer Bunny.  Looking for a place to spend the night is like searching for the Holy Grail. When do you stop looking?  Rest could be over the next hill, town, or empty field.  I haven't yet experienced a night in a farmers front yard, cemetery or church yard and the closer I came to the cities the less appealing those options became. Perhaps we have become accustomed to the distances that can be covered by the automobile and with Minneapolis and St. Paul so automobile close, and mere minutes away, there is not much need for campgrounds near to these major cities.  I decided to go a little out of the way towards Lindstrom and it's lakes hoping for a place to stay and then on to Chisago City where I was planning to pick up Manning Trail (a road, not a bike trail).  My luck held and the road was torn up (no one knew how long) and with no knowledge of a place to spend the night.  I had planned to ride this section on the next day - Thursday - after spending the night near North Branch 20 miles back.  I recall that a town a few miles off Manning Trail, Scandia, had a city park but was not sure that there was camping in the park and even that was a dozen or so more miles (Holy Grail....when do you stop?).  It doesn't take many bike miles to put a destination out of reach.   Some folks at a convenience store - the same ones who told me about the road construction - suggested moving on to Forest Lake nine miles further.  Bad decision Ian.  I was prepared to push my loaded bike over the road construction but the thought of spending the night off the road, this close to urbanization, was not a pleasant thought so off to possible rest and shower in Forest Lake.  Oh, ugliness; Forest Lake is fast becoming another suburb of the Twin Cities with franchises and the internal combustion engine.  Should have tried for Scandia!      In Forest Lake there was a choice between two very unattractive motels in  town - even for a sweaty, hungry cyclist, or two posh hotels on Interstate 35.  What to do?  Home is still 40 or perhaps 50 miles and I now had 90 miles under my tires.  Surprisingly, I felt good enough to seriously consider the extra miles but decided to call my wife Mary.  It was just before 5p.m. and she said she would pick me up as soon as she got off work!   I gave Mary directions to the Super America near the Interstate and promptly crossed the road to a Perkins for pie, ice cream, and raspberry iced tea.  Ride over. So, why do this you ask?  I think the physical challenge is most important.  The sense of exploration and Adventure satisfies immensely.  I could meet as many people at the overnights traveling comfortably by car or RV but I would miss the people opportunities along the way as water and food stops are absolutely essential.  Something new, interesting, and a little bit scary is important too.  And perhaps really most important at this time I have an interest in things with wheels powered by people and this is merely one aspect of that interest.  So this whole interest is one of life's chance directions?  Being in the elements (wind, rain, sun), the smells, and 'feel of the land' is important too, part of the experience.  Each to our own, I guess!   "
393,"Tent: I used a 1 1/2 person for a few tours then purchased at year end a 2 person tent and foot pad (goes under the tent).  Only slightly heavier and bulkier and the extra breathing room is really nice. A sleeping pad is essential.  I eventually upgraded to an expensive one and it is better than my 'beginner'.  Actually my wife convinces me to buy better stuff. If left to me I would probably have a 50 pound fleece bag and no sleeping pad.  Tent? How about a tarp? Clothes:  Camp stuff depends on the tour but for riding I will always go for lycra bib shorts and wicking tops.  I have switched to gel pads from chamois for the comfort.  I have the tapered elastic jerseys as well as Tee style with and without sleeves.  The lycra stuff and the jerseys show all of lifes excesses but it is so much more comfortable.  A long underwear top for under rain gear.  Hooded rain top and pants.  Rain top works as a windbreaker if I tuck the hood inside.  Waterproof shoe covers. These can get too warm sometimes but wet shoes the next day is not fun.  Sun block lip balm and sunblock for the bod'.  I have found that a sweat band under the helmet has all but eliminated sweat in the eyes.  I remove the front helmet pad for the sweat band to fit.  Spend the extra and get a proper ""camp"" towel from the outdoor stores - small and surprisingly absorbent. Trailer:    I used a Beast of Burden ""Cuz"" - a BOB.  It is not the more common BOB touring trailer you usually see.  It is an errand type of thing but it's what I have.  It's main purpose is to take the weight off my bicycle.  The 32 spoke wheels are a concern but I did a 14 day loaded tour last year (2003) with no wheel collapsing. That may not be the case as time and loads go by.    Trailers are tempting to take more stuff.  I went so far as sticking 3M command hooks to the side in order to carry the tent and sleeping bag on top.  Same weight as on the bike of course but it gave a high and wide wind catching profile.  On the rear bike rack my profile would shield the rack stuff.  A trailer is an extra wheel and tire.  One more item on the road to increase friction.  Mounting and dismounting the bike is not any easier with or without a trailer.  My rear panniers weigh less empty than the trailer empty. I always have front panniers so I didn't include them in weight comparison.  I found the loaded front panniers were necessary to keep the front wheel on the ground when getting on or off the bike with the trailer.  There is a lot to be said for the dedicated touring bike.  But I use what I have. Tools:  Tube and patch kit with pump.  I tour with a light weight, plastic, Zefal foot/floor pump. It will pump up to 120 #'s fast.  It is worth the slight weight and bulk over the small, exhausting, hand pumps that won't pump to a loaded touring bikes road tire pressure.  I would never go on a long tour without new puncture resistant tires.  If the old ones are suspect take them off and put them back on after the tour if you want to keep them.                   Spokes (12), spoke wrench, cassette removal tool and wrench that fits (small adjustable if it opens wide enough).                 There are a number of compact bicycle tool kits plus the ""Y"" shaped hex and socket wrenches. Small straight blade and a phillips screwdriver.                Duct tape (if it's important enough for Apollo 13 it's good enough for me)                    First aid kit - there are millions to choose from.  Mine is in a light weight nylon bag that came as a kit from REI. I guess just make sure your bicycle is in good condition.   Bring a flashlight of some kind.  The 'headlights' are good for reading at night. CAMERA AND JOURNAL: I have never journaled or kept a diary until I toured on a bicycle.  Second to marrying Mary it is the best thing I've done.  I have an inexpensive and small digital camera.  No fancy photos because the pictures are really for me to reminisce about from my rocking chair when I'm too old to do this anymore.  I look at the pictures at home and write them to a CD.   Food:   Minimal mess kit (boy scouts have had one since Queen Victoria's time).  Outdoor kinda stores have a huge selection. I take some food with but buy what I need each day.  Grocery stores are full of packaged food - rice, noodles, even tuna and salmon come in foil packages now.  I travel with tortilla's, not yeast bread, peanut butter and jam in plastic containers for quick food on the road.  Instant coffee and Tang. Tang is nice in the water bottles and is refreshing anytime.  Small stove with fuel supply in can that screws onto the stove.  Food is so dependent on the kind of tour.  If it is readily available great....  I tried the packaged stuff at the REI's of the world but found them wanting.  If I want an omelette I'll wait until a restaurant.  Oatmeal is good as are pancakes and easy to carry the makings.  I'm pretty new to this and my tours have been around parts of Minnesota and Wisconsin that are populated enough for convenience stores to be common.  Plastic containers for soap, maple syrup or whatever.  Waterproof matches.  I bought a bag from REI containing that stuff plus a small spatula and eating utensils; very nice but all of the contents could be purchased seperately.  I got tired of detail shopping and just went for the package deals. Radio: Oh for the sound of a human voice!  I have looked at all the retailers that sell electronics and have searched the internet for a handlebar attached radio. I found that small radios are uncommon too.  I know they exist as I saw one on a bicycle while riding the Multiple Sclerosis Ride Around Minnesota this July 2004.  I found only two on the internet - an Emerson and a Sony.  The Emerson is the one I saw this year but it is the Sony I plan on asking for Christmas.   Emerson/Pyramid  3-C batteries  AM/FM  horn and light built in   Sony model # ICF-M88B S2   AM/FM  computor  AA batteries - but I couldn't find how many. Lighter than C's anyway. Waterproof:    Contractor trash bags are so strong you could put anything in them.  And they are huge.  Trash compactor bags are smaller.  I would take both sizes.  Ordinary trash bags are way to fragile.  For recycling concerns I take several plastic shopping bags too.  Zip lock style bags are essential for many uses including food storage, camera, wallet.  I don't wrap the panniers, I put the wrapped things inside the panniers.  Whatever goes on the rear rack is wrapped of course. Weird:    When I stopped at the convenience store/gas station in Two Harbors I'm way disconnected from the hussle around me.  Here I am, alone all day, and not part of this scene at all.  It's not a bad or good thing, condemning the internal combustion engine, or whatever.  It just is.  It wasn't this way on last year's 14 day tour with a friend.  Locals don't necessarily know where anything is and DON'T TRUST THE MILEAGE OR TIME ESTIMATES.  They are CAR MILES NOT BIKE MILES. Traveling companions:  Not the human kind (as in Dr. Who).  Last year I travelled with a skunk hand puppet for the fun of it.  It also made a nice pillow cover over the lumpy, nylon clothes bag.  Earl was disgusted that I left him home so Earl and I now tour together.  Maybe I've had too many head injuries but I couldn't bring myself to use Earl as a pillow cover.  Goes to show what farmers have known for millenia - don't name your livestock.      "
394,"Sharon and I were both born and raised in Alberta and moved to Kamloops for our careers where we met by attending the same church. I think we have the same sense of adventure and I can't think of a better person to be sharing this experience with. My name is Shannon Gadsby, I am 34, I am married to this amazing man named Mark Gadsby, I have 4 kids - Jennifer, Melissa, Christopher and Ryley, we live with  two dogs, three cats and two fish.  My friend is Sharon DeJager, I am not sure if she wants me to tell you her age, and she has just met the man of her dreams - Paul. I know it pains her to leave him behind for this long but it has been said that absence makes the heart grow fonder!!! Is it possible?? As my adventure is just a month and a half away, it is really starting to feel like a BIG DEAL! Maybe it is because we have been planning this for 18 months or maybe because we know we are terribly going to miss everyone at home. Whatever it is, I am feeling both excited and a little ummm.. scared. I guess just afraid of the unknown. Sharon and I are going to bike from our home town of Kamloops BC to St. John's, NFLD. We are camping the whole way and are going to be averaging 90-120km a day. I have always wanted to travel across Canada and see all of the great country we live in and I am thrilled that I am finally doing it and in a way that will really let me experience the different cultures. Sharon's luxury item is a mp3 player loaded with songs that she and her boyfriend Paul selected and mine is a water colour kit. I am hoping that by the end of the trip I will have a small collection of paintings that I can frame and hang on the wall for daily reminders of this special time. Sharon and I plan to update this very regularly to let friends and family know how it's going. I have a digital camera that I am bringing so we can post pictures as we go too.  eeeeeeeeeks! The time is getting closer! Hi!  This is Sharon, coming to you presently from the comfort of my home - I'm enjoying it while I can!  Shannon has done an excellent job of introducing me, so I'll try not to ramble on.  I'm 37 years old (no, I don't mind saying!), and yes, I'm going to miss Paul terribly!!  He's from Washington, so maybe the next trip I do will be across the USA with him?!  I've dreamed about doing this trip for many years but wasn't sure I could ever find someone to do it with, who was compatible, could get that much time off work, and had the same desire, so finding out Shannon wanted to do this trip as much as me was a sure sign that we should DO IT! This is an amazing way to see my country, as I know from shorter cycling trips.  I just hope I don't forget to appreciate the beauty as I'm being blown off the road by head- or crosswinds, soaked to the skin in the downpour, or being attacked by blackflies as I struggle up yet another hill!   Wow!  Sounds like fun!  On the other hand, the experiences I've read from other cyclists who have done the same trip have inspired me immensely, particularly the stories of how many great people they've encountered along the way.

396,"   Back on the road again was our first taste of how encouraging motorists can be with all their honks, waves and ""where are you going?"" questions. It still seems strange to say ""We're going to Newfoundland"". The road shoulders were pretty narrow in places along this stretch and we rode through our first construction site which was a little interesting (eg. do I fall off the side of the road down the embankment or do I ride in traffic... hmmm). But after 8 hours we reached our destination. We decided to camp at the KOA in Salmon Arm. The hills through town were a challenge after the long day but by 4:30 we were off the bikes and enjoying the time we had with loved ones.     "
397,"   The road shoulders were very narrow and frightening at times and most of the bridges had no shoulder at all so we had to make sure there were no cars coming and peddle hard!! We took a rest break at 3 Valley Gap and toured around the grounds. They were beautiful but deserted.    We reached the Revelstoke KOA about 4:00 just as it started raining but we had a chance to have a hot shower and cook our first one-pot meal. From 3 Valley Gap to Revelstoke there are some large hills to climb and the toughest one for me was the last one just outside of Revelstoke before we reached the KOA. There was a cozy little shelter at the KOA that we hung out in while our towels dried and contemplated the hills to come the next day.
"
398,"   The roads leading up to Rogers Pass were fairly hilly but we knew the ""big one"" was still to come. We started climbing up the Rogers Pass about 12:30 hoping that the gas station on the top of the pass was open and had food for lunch. At the base of the pass, I noticed a fresh bike tire track in the mud (it turned out that Sharon noticed it too but we didn't mention it to each other) and I thought that maybe we had caught up to a cyclist that left Kamloops earlier in the week. About three quarters of the way up the pass I saw someone cycling and I don't know why but it was exciting and it gave me new energy. I peddled hard and managed to pass him with a wave and a ""race you up the hill"" challenge. As it turned out his name was Bill and he was from Victoria. He was pulling a trailer behind him and said it made the hills a bit harder. Bill was also biking across Canada but this was his second time. Originally from Newfoundland, he had cycled east to west about ten years earlier. The three of us had lunch together at the top of the pass and it was nice to hear the stories he told and get some advice from a seasoned cyclist.    After lunch, Bill decided he was going to Golden that day. By then it was almost 2:00 and he still had 80km to go. Sharon and I decided to try to find somewhere to camp so we said goodbye to Bill. Shortly after we checked out the information centre it started to rain so we had the chance to try out our rain gear. But... no sooner did we put it on and start riding, the sun came out again. After that it remained overcast with some sun until we had decided on a place to stay. There wasn't alot of information available for camping along this stretch of the road so we finally decided to stop for the day at the Heather Mountain Lodge. No one was around so we pulled up a piece of their concrete and set up camp for the night. I am sure the movie Heidi could have been filmed from there as the view was amazing and we were glad to be warm and dry for the night.   "
399,"Shortly after this section we came upon the Yoho bridge which was under construction. The flag lady was going to wave us through but after a second look, she didn't know what to do with us because the road was narrow and there were construction vehicles everywhere. Finally, she radioed down to someone on site to pick us up and drive us through. Our driver was a man named Buck. He was the site superintendent. He happily threw our bikes in the back of his pick-up and we made our way down onto the bridge. We had to wait for a while for traffic to clear and we started chatting to him and in the end I guess he liked us so much he decided to drive us to the top of 10-mile hill!!! The name 10-mile hill is pretty literal and we were very grateful to him for driving us that far.    The rest of the ride to field was pretty good but by the time I got there my knees really started to ache. We decided to stay the night there because as all the campgrounds were still closed. So we stayed in the Mt. Stephen guesthouse. We had a hot shower, warm bed, hot chocolate and a forecast of 10cm of snow before morning!!!   "
