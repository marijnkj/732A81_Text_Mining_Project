0,"   After my nap I had 8 more miles into New Meadow. On the way to New Meadows, I crossed the 45th parallel again. The first time I crossed the 45th parallel was just past Quake Lake heading north on Highway 287 towards Cameron, Montana. This was the second time I had crossed it, and I would cross it once more on the Oregon coast before my trip came to an end. I stopped for lunch in New Meadows at an awesome BBQ restaurant and enjoyed my lunch on their outdoor porch. There was another 7-mile climb out of New Meadows to Tamarack then downhill all the way to Council. Just before I got to Council I caught up with Nick, another cross-country cyclist. I had first met Nick in Walden, Colorado, when I was still riding with the KIWIs. Nick had started his ride 4/30 in Yorktown, Virginia, and on 7/7 he had just arrived in Walden after a two-week break from riding. He had lived in Colorado before his ride began and was an ASIC designer with HP. We rode together as a part of a larger group on 7/8, but the KIWIs and I split off from the group to do some extra miles that day. We decided we were both heading into Cambridge for the night so we would meet up later and get some dinner together.   I had heard reference that Cambridge was the gateway to the Snake River Canyon and I had images in my mind of a small bustling town. Well, I was dead wrong. This was no bustling town. Nick and I found that there were two restaurants in town. One that closed at 7pm and the other that delivered prepared but uncooked pizza. Well, it was after 7pm and the uncooked pizza would have been hard to cook on our camp stoves so we headed for the only other open establishment in town the bar. The bar served Tombstone pizza and  well  drinks which you would expect in a bar. We had a bear for an appetizer, another bear for our first course, then we each had a Tombstone Pizza followed by more drinks for desert.  We decided to hang around the bar for a while with the locals since it was Saturday night. This was the only drive in bar that I had seen on the trip as several locals came in and ordered carryout drinks to enjoy while they worked the hay harvest that night!

1,"    Once again I had gone from the higher elevation in Idaho with pine trees to a very arid desert environment in the Snake River Canyon. The arid surroundings are quite a contrast to the blue water of the Brownlee Reservoir in the Snake River Canyon. It was a nice long downhill to the lake level and then pretty flat as we rode along the banks of the Brownlee Reservoir to the dam.     We crossed the Snake River just below the Brownlee Dam and continued to ride along the Snake on the Oregon side of the river. When we crossed the Snake, not only did we cross from Idaho into Oregon but we also crossed into the Pacific Time Zone. The blackberries and wild plums were thick along the river and we stopped several times to load our pockets with fruit to snack on along the way. This helped as the day was pretty hot and other than the plants along the river the area was pretty barren.      We climbed out of the Snake River Canyon near the Oxbow Dam and had lunch in Pine Creek. Nick had a mail shipment to pickup on Monday in Halfway so we stopped there for the night. Halfway, Oregon, is a town that changed its name to Half.com so that it could be the first Internet city! There was quite a difference between the small towns of Halfway, Oregon, and Cambridge, Idaho. Halfway apparently has a lot of hunting business in the fall and winter. It appears the town has come upon better times recently as the Bed & Breakfast in town was listed in the Adventure Cycling literature as having a bunkhouse. Both Nick and I were looking forward to the bunkhouse as they are usually a close relative of hostels with individual bunks and shared bathrooms. When we called the Bed & Breakfast to inquire on the price of a night in the bunkhouse, we were told that the bunkhouse is now a suite in the B&B that goes for $180 per night. We were expecting to pay for the ability to sleep in a bed instead of our tents, but we were both thinking on the order of $10-$15 apiece so we opted for our tents at the Halfway Motel & RV park!  The owner of the motel had lots of hunting stories as we chatted with him on the front porch of his house after a nice dinner in town. He said Oregon had implemented a ban on hunting mountain lions with dogs and that the mountain lion population was now out of control as they have several mountain lions visit the town during the winter. The deer population is also way down, as you would expect, with an over population of mountain lions! They had many pictures in the lobby of the motel that showed the fruits of many a hunt: deer, elk, bear, and mountain lion.
"
2,"   We had a nice downhill into Richland then we turned west towards Baker City and were in for a long ride as the rest of the 51-mile day was up hill with a strong headwind. Nick and I never got into drafting and about 8 miles out of town I was feeling pretty good and started to pull away. That was the last time I saw Nick. Highway 86 follows the Powder River as it winds up towards Baker City. The Powder River cuts a pretty deep valley and the entire day the wind was shooting down this valley like the whitewater in the river!     A couple of miles east of Baker City at Flagstaff Hill Summit there is an Oregon Trail Interpretive Center.  I had read a lot about it, and it sounded very interesting so I was planning to stop and take the tour until I got there. I had just ridden 45 miles up hill and into the wind and was ready for the riding day to be over. I was almost to the top of Flagstaff Hill Summit and could see a large building on top of a hill just off the main road. As I got closer I could see wagons drawn in a circle on top of the hill. I then realized that this was the interpretive center that was located just north of the highway at the top of a hill. This was a pretty high hill that appeared to be at least 1,000 feet higher than the road on which I was traveling. I decided at that point to not go to the interpretive center and to head in to Baker City to have lunch and visit their library to send out an updated email.  I headed into town and ate lunch at the first restaurant I could find while I kept my eyes open for Nick. Nick never appeared so I headed to the library and then checked into the Oregon Trail Motel and had a good swim and good night's sleep.
"
3,"After I rode over Sumpter Pass, I saw the first signs of the Oregon wild fires that were burning in eastern Oregon. The smoke was coming over the next set of hills to the south. Just after I got over this first pass, I met the last cross-country eastbound cyclists that I saw during my trip. They were stopped roadside enjoying a snack and had just started 10 days prior in Astoria and were headed to Yorktown, Virginia. It was interesting to talk to them as they still had more than two months left in their journey and I only had 10 days left. At this point 10 days didn't seem like very much time to have left, but after further review I reminded myself that it was longer than most of the vacations I had taken over the past 15 years! At that point I decided that having 10 days left on my bike was not all that bad especially since it included riding through Oregon and along the Oregon coast for several days during the Oregon 'dry season'.  I had to ask these new travelers if they had already rid themselves of the extra equipment and clothes that they thought they needed when they started their trip but quickly decided they did not need when they rode over the first set of hills of their journey. I am convinced that this is an activity that all cross-country cyclists go through no matter how well they have packed. I knew that I had packed very efficiently when the owner of the hostel in Dudley, Massachusetts, where I stayed my first night on the road, told me that I was most likely carrying way too much gear and that I would probably send much of it home. I poo poo'd his comments. After my first day in Connecticut with the first serious set of hills, I found out just like all cross- country cyclists find out, that I had lots of stuff that I could easily get rid of. I just hadn't felt the pain until then! This couple had seen the light and felt the pain a couple of times and had already visited the post office twice to make shipments of excess items.  As I crested Tipton Pass, the second of the three passes, I could see fires on the hills on the other side of the valley. I stopped for lunch in Austin Junction. As I ate my lunch I saw fire crews head east down the road towards the fires. Luckily at this junction I was heading west which was away from the fires. But as I headed out of town and up to the top of Dixie Pass, the Forest Service roads heading south off Highway 26 had been closed due to the fires. Luckily this is as close to the fires that I ever got even though there were many fires in Oregon at the time and many were still very much out of control.
"
4,"I stopped for lunch in the town of John Day then headed on to Dayville where there is a hostel at the First Presbyterian Church. The church allows cyclists to stay there and sleep in the fellowship hall. Dayville was probably one of the friendliest towns of my entire trip. Everyone was very helpful in the town, as the local contact for the hostel had been hospitalized. In a town this small, population 205, it is probably pretty easy for everyone in town to keep up with everyone else's business. Pretty much everyone I talked to knew where the hostel was and what I needed to do to get into the hostel and get registered. I got to the hostel and cleaned up then walked into town for dinner.  One really nice thing about hostels along the route is that they all have logs that you can sign in and see where all of the others that you know in your riding community are along the trail. The KIWIs were now only three days ahead of me, and Sarah and Bob Wallace were only one day ahead of me. Sarah and Bob had been at the hostel the night before and enjoyed being there for a dinner that the church had for the firefighters that were in the area. I called Sarah and Bob that night and left them a message on their cell phone to let them know I was close and to see if we could meet up again. There was no sign of Nick in the log so he must still be behind me. I left him a note on the log with my cell phone number and email address.
"
5,"The two passes were Keyes Creek Pass at 33 miles and Ochoco Pass at 56. I stopped at a Forest Service Campground at the Ochoco Pass Summit to check it out and decide if I should continue down to Ochoco Reservoir or camp at the top of this summit. I talked to some locals and they recommended heading on down to the reservoir; and since I was already leaning that way to avoid the cold ride down in the morning, I headed on down the hill towards the reservoir. I left the top of Ochoco Summit at 1:30pm and the wind hadn't been too bad so far. As I headed over the pass I figured I would begin to hit some wind on my way down the pass, but since it was all downhill to the reservoir I figured how bad can it get? Well, the wind picked up at 2:00pm and I was peddling hard into the wind all the way down that hill!  I camped at the Ochoco Reservoir County Park and had a great site right on the lake. This lake was showing some signs of the drought in Oregon as the water level looked to be down about 15 to 20' from normal. It was still a nice place to camp and swim. After my swim I had a great dinner at a restaurant overlooking the lake.
"
6,"   It had been a nice quiet ride on back roads so far in Oregon, but that changed when I got to Redmond and got on Highway 126 towards Sisters. I made it to Sisters by 11:30 am and stopped for lunch. Sisters is a beautiful town in the central mountains of Oregon. It is a touristy town, and the summer crowds were out in full force. McKenzie Pass was west of town about 15 miles, and there were some really nice National Forest campgrounds just on the other side of the pass that I was going to try to get to for the night. After lunch I headed to the ranger station, as my touring book and the Adventure Cycling maps did not agree on whether there was drinking water available at the campgrounds. After getting assurance from the park rangers that there was no drinking water available at the campgrounds, I headed back into town to load up on water before heading out towards the pass.  I also checked my voice mail before heading into the wilderness for the night and found out that I had passed Sarah and Bob Wallace that morning in Prineville. They took a rest day in Prineville today and were planning to continue to Sisters the next day. I was sorry to have missed riding with them again. They were planning to end their trip in Florence, Oregon, on 8/7 so were in no hurry these last days of their trip. I also had a message from Nick who was now two days behind me. Nick was also planning to finish his ride in Florence. The nice thing about heading up McKenzie Pass is that I got off of busy Highway 126 as I left Sisters and got on Highway 242. The climb up the pass was long but gradual. Highway 242 is a very windy road and auto traffic is limited to 30 feet of total length. The traffic was very light and no RVs which is always a blessing. I stopped at the overlook at the top of the pass where you could see all the way to Mount Hood just outside of Portland 70 miles away. It was a nice place to take a break.     As I was enjoying my break, a guy drove up with his two kids. It turns out he was giving his wife, who was back at their campsite, a break and had loaded the kids in the car to go back into town to get some milk. As the two kids tried to lower the level of the pass by throwing as many rocks over the side as they could, we talked about the area. He was camping at Scott Lake which is the campground that I had thought would be a nice spot to camp. He said it was a great campground on a gravel road about a mile off the main road and that I would have no problem with my bike on the gravel road. He also told me that Scott Lake was not one lake but a series of natural alpine lakes and that there was a nice wide trail that started at the end of the road that went to all of the lakes. He thought that if I rode my bike down the trail I could probably have one of the lakes back away from the road all to myself as the road only went as far as the first lake. This sounded really nice to me! He also briefly mentioned that there were some mosquitoes in the area.    Turns out this guy used to be a bush pilot in Alaska. He then made the transition from bush pilot to fishing guide and had been a fishing guide in eastern Oregon and Idaho for a while after coming down to the lower 48 states. We were talking about the salmon runs that take place up the Columbia River, and he said that it was hard for him to eat salmon anymore after seeing how far they swim up river to spawn. It is pretty incredible to think that some of these fish swim the length of the state of Oregon just to get to the fast running waters of Idaho. There are now 11 dams on the Columbia and other rivers that they have to climb to get into Idaho. He thought that after they had traveled all that way, it is really hard to end their travel in a frying pan!     After our talk, he headed into town and I headed for Scott Lake. The gravel road was just as he had explained it, and the nice wide walking trail started right at the end of the road. I headed down the trail about ½ mile until I got to the second lake. I parked my bike just off the trail and walked down towards the lake to see if there were other campers. There was one other set of campers on this lake so I headed back to my bike to continue down the trail. I walked to my bike and was about to get on it when the swarm of mosquitoes that had been following me since I arrived at the lake finally caught up with me! This was no ordinary swarm of mosquitoes! It was only around 7pm so the sun was not even going down yet and these guys were out for blood! I began swatting my legs and my arms - killing 3-5 with every slap on my bare skin. These guys weren't just going for exposed skin; they were landing on my clothes, in my ears, eyes and nose!  I scrambled to get to my trusty REI DET repellant that I had tucked away in my camel back, wondering if I would get to the repellant first or if the mosquitoes would carry me away first. After what seemed like eternity, I got to my repellant and applied it to all bare skin and jumped back on my bike and headed for the next lake. This episode with mosquitoes reminded me of a passage in the book 'Undaunted Courage' which was taken from Lewis' journal of the Lewis and Clark expedition. Lewis noted in his journal, 'our trio of pests still invade and obstruct us on all occasions, these are the musquetoes eye knats and prickly pear, equal to any three curses that ever poor Egypt laiboured under, except the Mahometant Yoke.' At this moment, I could only imagine what they went through as they had no repellant to fall back on! (By the way my spell checker did catch Lewis' spelling errors but I decided to leave the quote just as Lewis had written it.) I soon got to the third lake and it was just as my friend at the pass had envisioned. I had the entire lake to myself, except for the swarms of mosquitoes that summered here on the lake! There were three campsites right on the lake that I would have all to myself with mountain peaks reflecting in the lake. I parked my bike and quickly made my way into the lake for a refreshing swim. Once out in the water I was somewhat left in peace to enjoy my soak, but as soon as I made my way back to the shore, the mosquitoes were there to drink to my return.     Thank goodness, it was cool enough that I could put on layers of clothes to help shield me from their aggression. I put on my long pants, wool socks, long sleeve shirt, long sleeve fleece and hat. I applied repellant to all exposed skin plus my hat and socks. Even with this there was a constant cloud around me while I prepared the camp and cooked dinner. The best defense was to keep moving so I walked in circles around the camp as I prepared and cooked dinner. Once dinner was over I headed to my tent so I could get an early start the next day and get some relief from the mosquitoes. Surely they would not be out in the morning!
"
7,"I stopped for lunch in McKenzie Bridge and considered camping there on the river for the night, but since it was a nice weekend the campgrounds were all full and there were no hiker/biker sites so I continued to Coburn. On the way from McKenzie Bridge to Coburn the blackberry bushes continued to amaze me on the side of the road! For ½ mile stretches at a time the blackberries would be thick and the ripe blackberries covered the bushes. I stopped several times to eat handfuls of blackberries. I even got picky at choosing which blackberries to pick. At first I was picking any blackberry that had turned black as that usually indicates that they are ripe. I soon learned however that the black berries that are visually plump are the ones that are really ripe and the sweetest!     The book I have on the cross-country bike trip suggested stopping in Coburn and staying at the Kamping World RV park. I could not have picked a spot more drastically different than my previous night's campsite.  Where I had the lake and campground basically to my self (less the mosquitoes of course) at Scott Lake, I now shared my campground in Coburn with at least 100 RVs. As I rode through the RV park to my tent campsite, I noticed many people in their RVs watching their big screen TVs in their easy chairs. It felt more like I was in a suburb neighborhood than a campground! But I later came to realize after discussing this experience with a friend, that if everyone liked camping in the Scott Lake campgrounds of the world, I would no longer like them because they would be to crowded. So, I should be thankful to the Kamping Worlds for attracting the crowds!

8,  
9,"Just outside of Corvallis, as I headed west on Highway 22 towards the coast, I ran into the first 'Oregon coast' riders that I would meet. Tom and Anne had just started their weeklong bike ride in Corvallis where they live. They were riding a recumbent tandem and were heading over to the coast and then down to the California border. Tom had done the northern tier cross-country ride a couple of years ago from Seattle, Washington, to Portland, Maine. He was just getting Anne comfortable with longer rides. As we headed west it looked like we would skirt just north of the rain, but it soon started to rain pretty hard. They were only going as far as the Casino at Grand Ronde their first night which was 50 miles from Corvallis. I continued at Grand Ronde and stopped for lunch in Boyer. The restaurant in Boyer (actually Boyer was not much except one restaurant) was closed on Mondays and since I had picked a Monday to arrive I sat out on the front porch and ate some snacks I had with me and watched it rain. About an hour after I arrived, it finally stopped raining and I continued towards the coast.  I got to Otis, which is only a couple of miles from the Pacific Ocean and met Steve and Sandy from Connecticut. They had started their ride in Portland the week before. They were heading 5 miles south of Otis to Lincoln City for the night. I was either going to Lincoln City, which was a little south off my route, or 10 miles north to Neskowin. Luckily I ran into them as they told me there was really nowhere to stay in Neskowin and that my celebration for reaching the coast would be much more enjoyable in Lincoln City. They also offered to buy the first round in Lincoln City to celebrate my reaching the coast. This was an offer that I could not refuse so I also headed to Lincoln City for the night. By the time we got to Lincoln City the fog had set in so thick that the ocean could not be seen. It was also a little cool so I decided to go to the hotel and get cleaned up before going out for my celebration. We headed out and celebrated even though I would not see the blue Pacific until the next day. I thought I had somewhat returned to civilization until I tried to order a Grey Goose martini at the bar to begin my celebration. Some time later, the waitress reappeared and said that I had the bartenders stumped on what was in a Grey Goose martini. At this point I decided to stick with drinking beer for my celebration!
"
10,"   I had heard some bad stories about how the wind could abuse northbound riders along the coast as the prevailing wind is from the northwest. I got a fairly late start but the wind didn't seem to be nearly as bad as it had been coming across eastern Oregon. I saw about 15-20 southbound Oregon coast riders as I headed north. The Oregon coast is a very popular bicycle tour in July and August as the weather is usually very nice and the rain usually subsides for these two months. The scenery is also incredibly beautiful along the coast. This was a nice day's ride as much of the day I was not on the busy Highway 101 that runs along the coast in Oregon. Soon after leaving Lincoln City I crossed the 45th parallel for the third and last time as I rode on a ten mile section of 'Old Scenic Highway 101'. This part of the highway has been bypassed by a new section of Highway 101 and goes back up in the coastal hills with some great views of the coast and the coastal forests. I was on Highway 101 for a short 8 miles before turning off on the 'Three Capes Scenic Route'. This is a seventy-mile stretch of road, which hugs the coast as Highway 101 cuts across further inland. Another reason the Oregon coast is very popular for bicycle touring is that the Oregon State Parks along the coast have some very nice hiker/biker campsites.     I was the first cyclist to show up at the hiker/biker area at Cape Lookout State Park. There were probably about 12 sites in the hiker/biker area and being the first to show up I picked the site that was almost right on the beach. The beach at Cape Lookout is about 50 yards wide and 7 miles long. It is an incredible beach that never looks very crowded as it is so big. I lay down to take a nap in the sun after arriving; and when I woke up, there were about 10 other cyclists that had arrived all heading south along the Oregon coast. There were four groups of riders, all from the San Francisco Bay Area; most were riding from Portland to the California State line. After showering I made my dinner and ate down on the beach so I could watch the sunset.
"
11,"   My days heading north to Astoria along the coast were all pretty short compared to the mileage I had been doing inland. They were short and getting shorter so that I had plenty of time to enjoy the surf and relax. I finally left the campsite around 10am. I rode a mere 10 miles up the coast to Oceanside and had lunch with a nice view of the ocean. I then stopped for a tour of the Cape Meares Lighthouse followed by a stop in Tillamook for a tour of the Tillamook cheese factory.     At Bay City I took the Miami River Road which headed inland through the coastal hills and was another nice break off of Highway 101. This road also protected me somewhat from the northwestern wind that had picked up this afternoon.   Nahalen was only a couple of miles from the Nahalen Bay State Park so I decided to stop there for dinner. Had a great dinner with a bottle of wine and almost enjoyed my dinner too much as I still had about 5 miles to ride, and it was already getting dark as I left the restaurant! Made it to the Nahalem Bay State Park after a total of 50 miles of riding. Again there was a nice hiker/biker area and with my arrival it was pretty much full. There were a total of seven other cyclists at this site: a father/son pair from Germany, a couple from Germany, a father/daughter pair from Oregon and one Canadian. I made it to the campsite in time to put my tent up as the sun was setting.
"
12,"I left the campground at 11:00am and took the back roads from the campground back out to Highway 101. While on the back roads I stopped at Neahkahnie Beach. This was a really nice beach where I decided to get my 'front wheel in the Pacific' picture indicating the end of my trip. This picture would go along with the 'rear wheel in the Atlantic' picture indicating the beginning of my trip that I had taken in Provincetown at the end of Cape Cod in late April.     Upon leaving this beach there was quite a climb back up to Highway 101 and then additional climbing up a pretty steep hill that overlooked Neahkahnie Beach and the Pacific Ocean. I stopped here for some time and enjoyed the view as well as the cool breeze after the long climb up the hill.     Just down the road at another pull off I met another cross-country cyclist, Gladys Sims, who had started in New York City on 5/10. Our trails had crossed several times across the country and now we finally met. She was continuing her ride down the Oregon coast and finishing in San Francisco. I thought of continuing my ride on into California several times as I saw all of the southbound riders along the Oregon coast but in the end decided to leave the ride down the Pacific coast for another tour! Gladys is the person who told me about the www.crazyguyonabike.com web page where I could post my journal. She had been posting hers to this web page as she rode which was probably a better idea than the lengthy emails that I have been sending out! I stopped in Cannon Beach and took a nap on the beach in the sun around noon. This was another great beach, and it was a cool day with a hot sun so it was perfect for a little snooze. Then I headed on into Seaside. Seaside has a promenade, which is a two-mile bike/walking path that is between the town and the beach. The beach is pretty amazing. At low tide it is probably over 100 yards wide and over four miles long. I was riding down the promenade when I found out Seaside was sponsoring the world's largest sand volleyball tournament this weekend and the practice rounds started this afternoon. I hung around the beach and watched some volleyball before heading to the hostel. After cleaning up at the hostel I headed into the back yard of the hostel which looked out onto the Necanicum River. I updated my log and diary as I finished the bottle of wine I had bought at dinner the night before and had been carrying in my Camelback all day. After updating my diary, I headed back out to the beach for dinner, more volleyball, and a beautiful sunset!   "
13,"   I stopped at the Fort Clatsop National Memorial where Lewis and Clark spent the winter in 1805/1806. After a couple of hours touring Fort Clatsop I headed on to Astoria.         Astoria sits out on a small peninsula of land that juts out into the mouth of the Columbia River. It was a sunny day but very windy as it often is in the Columbia River Gorge. The route of the ride took me up and over the hill that Astoria sits on with really nice views of the Columbia River.     My ride came to an end at the Astoria Maritime Museum on the Columbia River in downtown Astoria. I sat on the dock for a while watching the river head out into the ocean wondering what I should do next .is it back to reality to look for a job or should I start planning my next bicycle tour maybe I will head down to New Zealand and visit the KIWIs for the winter. After all, it is summer down there all winter!   "
14,"We managed to arrive in one piece during the evening at Bennett Springs State Park near Lebanon, Missouri. Many people were fishing in the river, perhaps for some kind of a tournament. The park was crowded and noisy so I slept poorly. Cricket did not seem to mind and passed a rather uneventful 1st night in a tent.   "
15,"We arrived at the western trail-head town of Clinton, Missouri and were on the bikes by 9:30 in the morning. This section of the trail was very hot and humid with little, if any, shade. We saw a few other cyclists as we rode through cattle-country and farmland. Eli was intent on challenging us to race every few minutes or so, but we managed to decline the repeated offers.    We pulled into Sedalia at 3:00 and met Trout Momma and Cricket at the State Fairground where they were busy snoozing in the shade of a great tree. We quickly found a quiet tent site, set up camp, and found the fantastic showers.What a great service to provide camping at the fairgrounds, thanks Missouri. Later that evening we visited my sister, Mary and her kids at Warrensburg. We had a nice visit and ate a good Cajun dinner at LaMaire's Restaurant.   "
16,"   As we glided through Missouri, we practiced drafting off each other like Lance and the French boys do. It really does work! Trout Momma and Cricket met us at various trailheads throughout the AM and we consumed mass quantities of snacks, gatorade, and H2O. The trail was much shadier today, and we saw lots of wildlife, including deer and rabbits.    Our first glimpse of the great and wild Missouri river came at Boonville, and we were humbled by her awesomeness as we crossed the new river bridge. We arrived at the almost abandoned Katy Roundhouse at 12:15. We had made great time. After picking a shady site to set up camp, we snoozed. I fell asleep in a chair and either skeeters or chiggers attacked my bare legs and had a regular feed fest. In the evening we went into Boonville and ate chicken fried steak, YUM.   "
17,"   This section of the trail runs through the pretty bluff area of the Missouri River. We could easily imagine the Lewis and Clark expedition exploring this country two hundred years earlier. We rode through the 1893 MK&T train tunnel in the fog and enjoyed seeing the picturesque town of Rocheport. We stopped and explored several caves and saw lots of wildlife. Supposedly, Indian petroglyphs can still be seen on the bluffs, although we were unable to spot them.    Near Jefferson City we were treated to scorching summer heat and a nice view of the Capitol dome. At last, we rode into the farm town of Tebbets and found our SAG team waiting for us near the grain elevator.    We then drove all over Missouri to find a place to camp. We ended up at Crooked Creek Campground at Kingdom City. What a dump! The ground for the tent sites were littered with broken glass and was hard as concrete. We did get to cool off in the swimming pool, and I drowned Eli several times. We ate at Taco Smell."
18,"   We finally stopped in Marthasville and went to Scenic Cycles where Matt worked on Eli's seatpost, and I bought a Katy Trail T shirt. We camped at the local ball park for 10 bucks, showers included. We were treated to co-ed softball late into the night and welcomed the free entertainment. Cricket found lots of kids to play with and was in puppy-heaven. Ate KFC.   "
19,"   We walked around St Charles in the afternoon and ate a good lunch. I was determined to visit the Lewis and Clark museum and then was disappointed when I found it. We headed home towards North Carolina and stayed in a motel in Okawville, Illinois. Had a good meal in a tavern in town.   "

22,"Just an observation: Little Green People.   In Paris the street cleaning crews' uniform is neon green. They even carry brooms with neon green brushes. The best part is the brushes are plastic shaped to look like straw. As if to look like an old peasant broom from the 1600's. Leave it to the French to provide their workers with less efficient brooms in the name of fashion. Train from Paris to Roen cost E 12.70. We got a discount for being under 26 with student id's. Roen was a neat city. We walked downtown and had a cafe for E1.5 (too expensive). We then headed out. Once we got out of the industrial suburbs it turned pretty, old homes with lots of character with pastures and sheep. It was getting close to dark with no official campsites nearby. We planned to just sleep behind some trees. Justin asked some ladies in a village if they knew of a place we could camp. One lady offered her yard. I thought that to be overly nice. So we biked to her house. Her husband put us up in an addition he was building onto the house. We got to sleep in an uncompleted room of a house, that was great! Then he brought some homemade cidre. These people are just too good to us. I think we are in St. Pierre de Manneville.         "

38,(following not for fant of heart) I usually try and hold it as long as humanly possible. That is until I find a normal toilet. This morning I had to go. So go I went. In the rain. With a wad of TP. If anyone watched me go to and fro they may have noticed my trip involved a long sleeve grey t-shirt. On the return a 1/2 and a 3/4 sleeve grey shirt. Lesson learned always bring as much TP as you can carry! Especially when there is goat cheese around. FYI I HATE these roman toilet. Should outlawed! I loved this t-shirt. Now I'll be cold tonight. Oh well.  The sorority named on my shirt was specificly left out to protect the innocent.  FYI If anyone knows where I can get a grey long sleeve Tridelt-Theta Casino Duo 2000 t-shirt from Texas A&M University fill me in.

40,"Got up and rode to Blois. It was slightly hilly but very windy. I believe I can come to expect wind in this area. All nearby camps are closed. The cheapest hotel is full. Went ahead and splurged on a hotel IBIS, 57 euros. Not a bad price for such a prime location. If anyone ever learns anything of value from me it won't be gas chomotography but rather that Hotel Ibis is the best deal for a hotel in France, period. Every IBIS I've stayed in has had exceptional service and clean rooms at attractive prices. I've stayed in some very scary places. And I've stayed in very nice places. IBIS is the best for the price in europe. Actually if you're interested in learning gas chomotography shoot me an email. I have a list of things I've learned not to do with those expensive machine no matter how fun it sounds.    I have to stay in town so I can go to a bank where english is spoken and this is a popular tourist town.   Blois has a great staff at there visitor information center. They were nice to me even though I look/smell more like Grizzly Adams. A pretty blonde Canadian girl doing an internship gave me directions to a bookshop with english titles.     "

46,"* Things France could do without. At risk of loosing some of its culture.   1)Dog crap everywhere   2)Smoking like maniacs   3)Urine smell everywhere. Not entirely due to dogs. Although I have a list of do withouts for France I could easily make one for the states also.  On more than one occassion someone has approached me speaking in french. I reply that I don't speak french. Their reply is to repeat the same thing over and over only louder and much FASTER! Do they expect me to automaticly learn french as a result?     Our train got into Limoges late. The conductor was yelling at me to hurry up and where to go. Of course having bags, tent, sleeping pad, locked bike didn't help any. He was not in the least bit helpful. He could have helped with bags. I heard him say something about English to some other man. Maybe I should learn french for no other reason than to find out if I'm being insulted or just spoken about. One station worker escorted me to the correct voie (track) but didn't help with bags, bike, anything! Why would someone go to the effort to watch me struggle with all my gear and keep telling me to hurry along, if they aren't going to at least carry one of my items? I got there stairs and all in plenty of time. No hold up due to me."
47,"Don't ask to read the intro to my 'Tom Jones' book. This cafe, which is a very nice one, doesn't have t.p. or soap in the WC. I am beginning to think french don't believe in hygiene. Think twice before shaking hands with a frenchman.   For 23E that tour was great. We went to 2 chateauxs. 1st was in bouih 2nd was in Blaye. Both were good. But I felt the 2nd had a better quality. Not that I would know. I bought one bottle of 1999 Grand Reserve from the second. That vinyard also had a wine that was not Red and not Rose but in between. Good stuff. The USA needs to start buying Rose wines. It's perfect summer wine.   The lady working there asked where I was from. I told her, ""from Texas."" She had an amused look on her face and asked if I have had any problems due to the recent actions of the U.S. I think france has really seen a decline in the number of American tourist. And that is what I've gathered from her also. Later on when I got back to my room, the French guys asked me if I was Australian or American. One guy that spoke english said, ""America..no good."" He was joking with a smile and shook my hand. A 3rd guy came in later and asked me the same thing. He asked if I liked France. I told him very much. That was all he could say in english. The other 2 really wanted to talk after learning that I cycled as much as I have.    I went to do laundry! 3.5 euros wash no dry a small load! No wonder people think french smell. They can't afford to do laundry. 1st you have to ring yourself in by pushing a button? Maybe it's on a timer to not open after a certain time? .5E for soap. One thing that is far supior to our system is they have a central money deposit machine. You put money in and press which machine you want to start. Very cool. They also have a great video rental system. A single machine will dispense your choice of movie like a coke machine.  When I got back all 3 guys were there. Very nice guys. So now I am ""Mr. Bush."" I take that as a compliment. One asked me if I've been to Spain. I told him Barcelona twice and Pamplona for the San Fermin festival. The running of the bulls festival. He was amused with the bulls. If only he knew I thought it boring compared to actually riding a bull. On or before I was ""Mr. Bush,"" he asked if I was a cowboy. I told him ""no cows."" Now I wish I did have cows. I coulda lied, I guess.  So they left. I decided to go down to the common area. 3 men are working on their 4th bottle with their meal. A school group also arrived. My floor is mixed gender. I thought that it might be so when I took my shower yesterday. Slightly opaque glass is all that stands between my manhood and the restroom sink area.   I wish I knew tomorrow's weather. The decision on what to do next is still in the air. Bike around, tour town more, rent car, train elsewhere?  Called home and left a message to left dad know where I am. Mom and grandma went to Houston for Aunt Marggie's birthday.             "

49,"Two years later, we've decided to wrap up our job in Scotland and go on home to the US.  As a farewell gesture, we thought we'd ride across Scotland.  From the Firth of Clyde to the Firth of Forth is really only a day's trip even for us, so we think we can actually make this one. Our journey will take us from our home in Glasgow along the Forth & Clyde Canal and the Union Canal.  We'll leave the Union Canal before Edinburgh to cross the Forth and ride along the south coast of the Kingdom of Fife to Crail (where they sell fresh-cooked lobster right on the harbour).  Finally, we'll ride from Crail up to Leuchars to catch a train home.

Bath St to F&C Canal near Possil Loch.  We rode into town for church, so our journey started on Bath Street.  This section is through a somewhat industrial part of town.  We made one small, itty bitty wrong turn, so it took us almost an hour to get to the canal.  The bit of the canal we started on was near the bird sancturary. Forth & Clyde Canal Starting at the bird sanctuary meant we missed the burnt out cars between there and our house in Kelvinside.  We've done the canal all the way back to Clydeport anyway. We did not stop to see the iron coffin pens at Cadder Rd.  They were built to discourage graverobbers from Glasgow Uni. Beyond the Craft Daft on a Raft at Glasgow Bridge and we were onto the part of the canal we'd never seen.  Not much different really.  Greener, but just as many irritating gates.  (The F&C is dotted with annoying little gates that prevent access by motor vehicle.  They are easy enough to walk through, but a loaded bicycle is a toughie because of the sharp turn necessary.  Some of the gates also are collectors of mud.) The F&C canal is largely flat.  There are a few locks on either end, but the only hilliness is at road crossings, and most of these are under the bridges, so there's no real trouble.  There's a nice pay toilet at Townhead/Cowgate Rd bridge (Kirkintilloch).  It's on the south side of the canal, so you have to cross the bridge.  After Kirkintilloch, it's pretty much all rural land. A wee bit before the bridge for Twechar's main street (no real settlement),  a road (B8023) follows the canal on the north bank.  The towpath becomes ridiculously narrow at this point.  There's no easy way to get a loaded bike over the fence and onto the road, so you're stuck.  Just hope you don't encounter anyone from the opposite direction; there is nowhere to go.  (Well, you could go into the canal, but that wouldn't be good for your bike.)  There are nice picnic tables at the bridge, though. At Kilsyth (B802) we stopped to eat fried food at a trailer next to an abandoned quarry that is now a park.   There are no toilets, though, nor did we find any for another 8 miles or so. A bit after crossing under the A80, we stopped at a house on Lock 18 to have ice cream.  There were good signs on the towpath, and we were glad for the break (they let us use their bathroom--we'd have paid by this point).   A few more miles, and we were at the Falkirk Wheel (http://www.falkirk-wheel.com).  This is definitely something to see if you're in the neighborhood, even if you're going by car.  The F&C and Union canals have 115 feet between them.  In the 19th century, a large series of locks linked them.  Now, they are connected by a gigantic Ferris wheel opened just last summer.  The two arms of the wheel carry boats between the canals.  I am fascinated by the idea of spending millions of pounds to create a modern technological link between two products of 19th century technology (made mostly obsolete AAMOF well over a hundred years ago). I suppose the bicycle is an old technology, too, but the Falkirk Wheel doesn't help us.  We pushed our bikes up the hill to get onto the Union Canal. I had some trouble with bad distance measurement from the Glasgow map.  It was much better on the OS map (for Union Canal). Union Canal The Union Canal links Falkirk to Edinburgh, so it is possible to ride the canal all the way from Glasgow to Edinburgh.   But we'll leave the canals tomorrow.  The canal starts immediately with a short tunnel, followed by a lock.  Both of these are new with the Wheel.  The tunnel is smooth and well-lit.  The Union Canal is a contour canal, so there are no further locks.  This means it's even more flat than the F&C. About two and a half miles in, there's a much longer tunnel, built to keep a local lord from having to see the canal from his house.  This part of the project probably helped lead to its eventual bankruptcy. The tunnel is cold, wet and very  slippery.  Watch your step!  There is lighting, but our headlights helped.  I'd still recommend a flashlight.   Compare this original tunnel to the new one earlier. This part of the Union Canal provides fewer country-side viewing opportunities than the F&C because you spend much time in narrow hollows.  Also, the places where the towpath passes under bridges is much narrower.  So narrow that we felt the need to ring our bells at each for fear of confrontation with oncoming cyclists.  Luckily, there were few of these. If the general layout of the Union Canal lacks something during the normal stretches, this is more than made up for by the outstanding features like the tunnels and viaducts.  About 9 miles in, we crossed a beautiful viaduct that carried us and the canal on arches hundreds of feet above the River Almond.  I wish a picture could have shown the magnificence of this structure. A mile and a half after the viaduct, we left the canal to find our campground.  The town is Linlithgow and the two miles to the campground are entirely up hill.  Although the map, when properly read, shows this 120 metre climb, I somehow missed it and we struggled against the unexpected climb at the end of a ride that was longer than expected because of my mismeasurement.  We rolled in, totally exhausted. The campground, run by the council, is nicely rural.  The campsite is a field next to a wash house shared by several tents, but it is surrounded by trees.  The other tenters were well-behaved, except for the ones in the women's room, apparently. It would have been nice to have more than one shower to share, but the in-park restaurant was very nice for dinner.  From our table, we had a nice view of the Forth Bridge--something to look forward to tomorrow.
"
52,"One missed turn cost us two miles. Road signage in Britain needs MAJOR help. But we found the canal path near Lambhill. The path is beautiful in July, if a little overgrown in places. But not bad! Purple, blue, white, yellow wild flowers, and green green green! I could smell wild chamomile and something that reminded me of herbal insect repellant. Don't know what that is. Trees shelter the path in places. Swans have young right now, some almost grown, and some tiny chicks. When the sun shines, it's hot. The water turns into a brilliant blue mirror, reflecting each flower and tree. Drenching rain showers come and go from south to north all day, sweeping over us.  Around Twechar the path becomes very narrow, but still passable. But our legs got quite a thistle treatment! The barriers at the road crossings along the canal art so ANTI-BIKE!  Lunch was sausage rolls in Kilsyth at a snack shack beside a quarry. At Lock 18 the Lock house is well kept. The couple there have put up signs - icecream, cold drinks, snacks. We stopped for toilets, ice cream with raspberry sauce, and a chat. Gemma the jack russell terrier was very friendly and played football with us.  At the Falkirk Wheel the climb to the Union Canal is steep but not bad. From the path the view periodically opens up through the trees across the valley, over farms and villages, steeples, copses, sun in glorious rays mottling the distant gnarled hills. There are two long tunnels and a high aqueduct. The longer tunnel, almost a mile in length, is wet. Water laden with minerals drips down leaving calcium white and iron rust deposits, peach, orange, burgundy. The narrow path running beside the canal is so slippery. It's dimly lit every few metres. When we'd walked what seemed to me most of the way, I noticed the green arrow pointing behind me, indicating that the closest exit from the tunnel was still the way we'd come. We weren't even half of the way through! I was so sure one of the panniers would pop off the bike and fall into the water.  After the tunnel, I started thinking about some new story ideas (mostly involving creatures living in canal tunnels) and didn't pay attention to the biking. Towards the end it got very hard. John had only measured it as a 35 mile day, and extra miles at the end always seem longer. ""Are we there yet?!"" We finished our first day of riding in Linlithgow.  The road to the camp ground was two miles of sheer verticality. John also didn't look at elevations. We walked most of it in utter exhaustion. The campground is so beautiful, though (Beecraigs Country Park south of Linlithgow). Pine forest atop the hill with views out over the valley and of the Forth bridges (where we'll bike tomorrow). There's a restaurant in the lodge, the dining room takes advantage of the views and served great food. I had roast beef with yorkshire puddings, John had piri piri chicken, and cheesecake for dessert.  The campsite was okay, but selfish piggy people were hogging all the space in the bathroom and the one shower. They're making lots of noise after hours. They also enjoy discussing their infectious rashes at top volume while touching everything in the bathroom. I went to bed dirty. Now if they'll just shut up, I could get some sleep. Good night!"

54,"Down that vertical hill back to the canal was really fun - such amazing views! Besides, John is carrying the panniers today. Wheee! Five more miles along the Union Canal - then we carried the bikes up some steps to the road. The ride to the Forth Bridge was quite easy. We stopped in Newton for orange juice, bananas, and sent a post card to Peter & Heidi. John stood outside drinking the OJ, and a woman suggested he'd be better off with whisky.  The bridge is about a mile long, and is very scary (I don't like heights). You can see the water far below on both sides of the bike lane. There was a sail boat class below us - tiny little sails weaving around. The power station's flaming stacks looked so cool. The cliffs along the side of the bridge remind me of the Chesapeake Bay. The path from the bridge to Inverkeithing is a little bit confusing, but gets you there (up a big hill). We stopped at a bike shop in town so John could get a new seat (his had almost completely detached).  The bike trail from Inverkeithing to Burntisland is really great. Some of it is off road, through coastal communities. New housing around Dalgety Bay is beautiful, with interesting architecture and manicured gardens, but it is so suburban, something so sterile about it. Also goes through some industrial sites, all interesting, some smelly. The off road parts are a bit mountain-bikey: gravel paths through woods, views of the coast and firth from time to time, hilly, waterfalls. We saw seals basking on the rocks (sometimes hard to tell from rocks.) There was a ruined church beside the coast, very cool.  We ate lunch in Aberdour at a hotel - very nice. Cozy lounge with a stained glass ceiling, dark wood paneling, all very clean. Fish, chips, mushy peas, ham, brie and tomato sandwich  on brown baguette. Rained on us again leaving Aberdour - got quite a soaking. The fair was in Burntisland - that was fun to see. So many people! Rides, buskers, stands of all sorts.. all so colorful (now that the sun was out.)  Whoever planned the bike route north of Burntisland should be dragged into the square and shot. Then run over by a herd of cyclists. The signs blithely led us out of town, up a road, up another road, and then off the road into the woods, up up up UP! We literally had to push our bikes up on foot almost 200 metres in less than a mile. The path was so steep and sharply switch-backed that it was impossible to ride (even if we'd had the strength to pedal up such a grade). At the top, the signs disappear. The paths diverge among rolling fields, and it's unclear which path will lead down. At one confusing split, I left my bike with John and walked down one path a ways - couldn't tell where it went. I came back and walked down another likely path, and as I crested a small rise, the sound of rifle shot stopped my heart! I was so frightened - didn't know whether to shout out or drop to the ground.  But from there I could see a farm house and a wall that might have been along a road. So we went that way, and after passing the two young men in camouflage shooting targets (by the wall along the path), we did find a road. We went downhill for about four miles, which only took about ten minutes! ZOOM!  But I'm losing all faith in John's ability to read a map. It does say that the cycle route in that section is not complete, and it does show elevations. I think I'll be checking the maps myself from now on, before I follow him anywhere. We biked through Kirkaldy, found a B&B along our route with the help of the tourist office, and finished our day in Dysart at the Norview B&B. We got clean, ordered pizza, watched TV and went to bed - with pillows and a mattress and a roof! Luxury."
55,"Breakfast:  (on ground in front of Beecraigs restaurant) PB&J on bagels.  Chocolate flapjack (J) Lunch: (Aberdour Hotel) Fish & Chips (L), Warm Ham, Brie & Tomato Sandwich (J) Dinner: (Delivered) pizza, chips, garlic bread. Accomodation:  Norview B&B (http://www.roomfinderscotland.co.uk/mapsearch.php?townid=52) Today, we took a bit of the canal, a bit of road, and a bit of bike path.  The ride down to the Union Canal was much better than the road up to the campsite.  It was a nice beginning two miles. Because the Union Canal is a contour canal, sometimes it cuts into the hills and there are high embankments on either side.  The underpasses for the tow-path (under crossing roads) were quite tight compared to the F&C and were often blind.  There were many of these in our short part of the canal, and we rang our bells as loud as we could when approaching.  But we met no other bikers, perhaps because we had left so early.  When we came to the road we were leaving the canal for, we had to carry our bikes up stone steps near the bridge.  This was worse for Lori's bike, because she had the heavy load today.  But it wasn't as much of a climb as it could have been, I suppose, and the road ride to the Forth Road Bridge was uneventful.  We stopped at a dairy store for a drink and to send a postcard. The approach to the Forth Road Bridge from the west forced us through a roundabout and down a fairly busy road (after a potty break at a Shell station) for maybe a quarter mile.  Then we were on the bicycle/pedestrian path and climbed over the bridge.  The bike/walkways are very wide and hang off of both sides of the bridge to support North-bound and South-bound traffic.  Because they hang off the bridge, if you stop you can feel every vibration of the bridge.  It's quite scary, but the view of the Forth is magnificent and you pass by it too quickly in a car. On the other side of the Forth, we entered the Kingdom of Fife.  We followed the signs to the Kingdom Cycle Route.  This is a part of the National Bicycle Route 1.  The signing was slightly confusing because it took you awkwardly along sidewalks to avoid roundabouts, but eventually we climbed the big hill into Inverkeithing, which smelled somewhat.  About three-quarters of the way up the hill, we stopped at a bicycle shop and bought a new seat for my bike.  (A few days ago, I installed new clipless petals but neglected to loosen the fittings, so my feet got stuck to the pedals and I fell over hard on the street, cracking my seat's support.  Yesterday, I broke the seat completely trying to get through one of the many gates on the F&C Canal.   Before the bike shop, I'd been riding with the seat balanced on the post.) After Inverkeithing, a mix of neighborhood roads and bicycle paths took us along through Dalgety Bay and Aberdour.   There were some rather new housing developments, but also many nice glimpses of the Firth.  We stopped at a church ruin, then rode along a deserted road into Aberdour, where we stopped for lunch as the rain started. After our lunch the rain continued and, as you would expect, we got wet.  Most of the route between Aberdour and Burntisland was off-road, and much of it was through fairly dense wooded areas.  I wouldn't take a road bike through there, but the hybrids were okay.  The rain was annoying, but we did glimpse seals on the rocks.  The rain let up by the time we got to the factory-laden areas just outside Burntisland, where there was a festival in progress.  The signage was slightly confusing coming into Burntisland, but that may have mostly been my reluctance to go up hill.  Overall, I'd say the signage for the Kingdom Route is good. But I wouldn't say the route itself is always that great.  The route takes you out of Burntisland by way of a terrible vertical ascent.  The path was very rocky and rooty, and was more-or-less straight up (well, there were a few switch-backs).  The route certainly beat our hybrids, especially laden with our touring gear.  I wouldn't even go down that bit, if given the choice.  We pushed for well over an hour.  We thought we'd found the top of the hill, but it was only a dip for some sort of construction.  It looked like a new reservoir was being made.  The route markings stop during this bit, so we had some unease about whether or not we were following the right path, and at one point Lori walked ahead to check the route when we heard gunshots.   We couldn't see where the shots were coming from, so we slowly moved our bikes along what was now a farm-track, two muddy and rocky ruts.  By this point, Lori was not talking to me.  I suppose it's obvious that there's a climb from the topographical lines on the map, but I really hadn't thought a bike route would take us through such conditions.  We'd have been much, much better off taking the A921 or, even better, the B923.  I think either road would have avoided much of the hill, and certainly all of the rocky rooty ruts.  My new theory is that bicycle route makers are different than we are.  They seem to want to avoid traffic at all costs, while Lori and I don't mind traffic if it means we can avoid hills and bad surfaces.   Finally, we passed the two guys out target practicing and found the road at the top of the hill.  From this point all the way into Kirkaldy, it was down hill through farmland.  We spotted a few hawks, but we were going too fast to see much.  It was nice to do, but not worth the climb.   In Kirkaldy, we went into the town to check with Information about where we could stay the night.  After the climb, we were certainly not going to camp.  We explained to the Information attendent that we were going East on bicycles and would like to get a place to stay along our route.  She wanted to tell us about places back the way we'd come or up the hill to the North.  Finally, she got us a place in Dysart, a little more along to the East.  At this point, we left the Kingdom route and followed the A955.  The woman at the Norview was nice and let us keep the bikes in the back garden.   We ordered pizza and went to bed. I think it would be nice if the bike map had mile markings, but the route was good except for the Burntisland hill."

57,"Breakfast:  (Norview, Dysart) Egg, Sausage, Bacon Lunch: (, Anstruther) Fish/Chips (L) Chicken Goujons/chips (J) Dinner:  (Chip Shop, Crail) Dixie Fried Chicken/chips (J) Scampi/Chips (L) Dessert: (East Neuk Hotel, Crail) Raspberry Sponge (L) Raspberry Roulade (J) Accomodation:  Cailpie House (http://www.caipliehouse.com/) Today we strayed from the bike route and it was a much nicer ride, slope-wise.  The woman at the B&B was an unusual exception:  someone who could judge a  hill.  We had to pay cash for the stay and I didn't have enough, so she directed me to the nearest ATM.  Her directions were good and she did a very good job of describing exactly where the hills were.  I was very impressed.  I was also very wet: it rained the entire trip to the bank and back.  The rain continued for the first hour of our day's trip, then it was beautiful weather to go with the nearly all downhill journey.  What a glorious day. There was a little bit of a climb to Upper Largo and a small climb out of Anstruther.  Otherwise, we were generally in the teens per hour.  (A second day I'm glad we didn't go the other direction.) We took the A917 out of Dysart.  I liked the small houses in Coaltown.  We switched to the B942 which took us nearly to Pittenweem (we re-joined the A917 at the end of B942).  Riding the A and B roads was event-free.  Certainly, there was not an over-abundance of cars, and those that passed did seem to have some understanding of what they were doing.  We felt little danger. When planning our trip, we had heard of a famous fish'n'chip shop in Anstruther, but along the way, we were told that there was a shop in Pittenweem that was much better.  So we stopped in Pittenweem for directions, but they were of little help.  We were directed to go to Anstruther.  Guess they wanted to keep their fish to themselves. Inside Anstruther, we turned right at the circle down into the harbour. Anstruther had a nice wee lighthouse on the jetty, but the chip shop was terribly rude.  On the advice of locals, we didn't go to the famous one.  Instead, we went to one that was run by a guy who used to own a fish factory.  Lori said that the fish tasted good, but we wound up leaving without dessert.  The waitress took Lori's dessert order (no diet on the bikes!), but she walked off to help someone move a baby chair.  Then she ignored us as we tried to finish our ordering.  She had ignored me earlier when she asked Lori if she wanted sauce.  And to top it all off, she charged us 20p for each packet of sauce (ketchup and tartare).  She never mentioned this charge, nor was it listed on the menu.  80p we paid!  Sheez. To get out of the harbor, we followed the map's suggested route through neighborhoods until we made it back to the A917.  From Anstruther, we continued on the A917 to Crail, feeling it would be shorter than the map's suggested route, and it was a very nice ride with rolling countryside and the Forth off to our right. On arriving in Crail, we checked in and walked down to the harbour.  The route to the harbour is terribly steep, and we did not take our bikes down there.  The harbour must be one of the most photographed in Scotland, all stone and small fishing boats.  It's a tidal harbour, so many boats were resting on their keels.   Crail was our true goal for this trip.  Lori had seen a report on the lobsters that were cooked right at the dockside after they were brought in by the boats.  There was a little shack with a cement tank outside.  It also had a sign:  No Lobster Today!  Oh, my.   Lobsters aside, the town was an excellent place to stop.  We walked along the market square and visited the rock thrown by a giant.  The stone houses and stores are huddled together on the hill climbing off the harbour.  Very much, today was a relaxing and enjoyable day.  Maybe there'll be lobster tomorrow."
58,"The biking today along the road that follows the coast around the East Neuk of Fife was easy peasy! We had a tailwind, and it was mostly down hill or gently rolling the whole way. The rain finally petered out around lunch time (fish and chips in Anstruther, definitely delicious, but frustrating service.)  Then as we got to Crail around 2 pm, the sky cleared to blue, the sun burned bright, and it could not have been a more beautiful sight.  The Caiplie B&B that Graham recommended had a sea-view room available. We dumped our stuff, locked up the bikes in the garage, and wandered the town. I've found very few places that I could imagine living - I think this might be one of them. (I know that's partly because it's sunny.)  The lobster shack (as seen on Rick Stein's Best of Britain cooking show) was closed today - no shellfish. We'll try again tomorrow. The parish church - parts of the building date from the 13C. There's even an 8C stone in the entry. Impressive job at updating and redecorating - managed to keep a very traditional look that accentuates the old features, while making it clean and bright and comfortable. New pews and carpeting, big, bright arched windows. I especially love the stained glass set in a few of the walls - and in the oldest part, the bell tower. Somewhat art deco in style, in deep jewel colors, representing creation and redemption. Stone and colored glass! Sublime.  The harbor, the coast walk, the tiny stone cottages on winding streets - all wonderful. We got cleaned up and went to the chippie for supper. John had chicken ""dixie style"" complete with confederate flag on the box - scary. I had scampi and egg rolls. We took it down to the harbor to eat, and watched the tide come in. We sat for hours, writing and staring. What a perfect spot! We finished the day with dessert at the East Neuk Hotel. We like roulade better than sponge. More tomorrow!"

60,"Crail, St. Andrews, Leuchars (Glasgow) Breakfast: (Cailpie House, Crail) Pancakes/Bacon (J) Salmon (L)  Lunch: Lobster/Crab (L-Crail Harbour) Salami/Sweet Chilli Chicken/Cheese sandwich (J-Cherries, StAndrews) Accomodation:  Home Because there were no lobsters yesterday, we decided to hang out and wait in Crail to see if today would bring the crustaceans in.  And indeed they came.  I think Lori enjoyed her lunch, though I don't touch the stuff.  While waiting for the lobsters and crabs to visit, we visited the local museum and wandered over to the old church off the market area.  As we poked about the outside of the church, a caretake came and asked if we'd like to go inside.   So it was early afternoon when we mounted our bicycles and left Crail.  There's little to tell about this half-day of riding.  The route we chose along the coast was very easy and took us through some lovely countryside.   We did not take the route suggested by the map; instead, we followed A917.  This seemed to us the shorter route.  As yesterday, there was little traffic and no appreciable up-hills.  In fact, most of this section was slightly downhill until just south of St Andrews, where the downward slope brought us into St Andrews at an incredible clip.   We stopped for restrooms and snack in St Andrews before taking the bike path from there to Leuchars.   We did have a little trouble getting to the bike path from centre St Andrews, winding up a few times down blind paths and parking lots.  In fact, we rode a bit on the road next to the path because we couldn't find a way over the fence that separated the path from the drivers. All-in-all, a quiet day.  Midway between St Andrews and Leuchars is Guardbridge.  The section following Guardbridge was not the loveliest.  We seemed to be passing industrial/military buildings and housing.   We arrived at Leuchars without having made reservations for putting our bicycles on the train, but there was no trouble there or in Edinburgh (where we changed trains).  We definitely appreciated the ability to take our bikes on the trains, something we couldn't do in the US.  It meant that we could take an essentially linear trip without support.  Kudos to ScotRail."
61,"Crail has two small shops for basic grocery supplies, a green grocer, a butcher (the best one I've ever seen - lots of variety, all nicely prepared, things like chinese pork chops and beef chorizo burgers), and seafood is available right off the boats at the harbor. Also, the town hall and community centre seem to have a lot going on. What an idyllic small town! Looking at the house prices, though - you pay for idyllic. Quite expensive! more than £200k for a small cottage. John and I sat at the harbor until lunch and played gin rummy. The boats came in, took their catches over to a big truck to be weighed and sold. At noon, the ladies opened the fish shack. I was the first in the queue and got a boiled lobster and a boiled crab. What a treat! They handed them to me fresh from the water, fresh from the pot, on a plate with a fork and knife and claw cracker. We sat at a picnic table under an awning on the harbor (it spit rain all morning) and I dug in!  The lobster was good, if a bit chewy. The crab was stringy and fishy. I may be biased, but they didn't come close to the taste of Chesapeake Bay blue crabs. But it was good and a fun experience. John ate a flapjack (a granola bar) for lunch. We loaded up the bikes and left Crail, another easy day of biking. It must be all downhill from Kirkaldy! No serious rain.  St. Andrews was crowded and the signs for the public toilets led us around and around. We had sandwiches at Cherries - John's sweet chili chicken was delicious. Five miles later we were in Leuchars and the train arrived five minutes after that. We strained our necks looking out the window and down at the maps - following our bike route backwards. How fast it all goes by when you don't have to pedal!  The Burntisland hill is just unbelievable. Did we really push our bikes all the way up there?! Yes, we most cerrtainly did. We looked up and down for landmarks - there were the fence posts, the road where we turned off - yup. The sheer face of rock and woods rising behind the town is precisely the one we went over. We're completely insane.  In less than two hours, we were back in Glasgow, and after ditching our bikes at Peter and Heidi's, and a quick ride home from Peter, we could call the trip across Scotland officially over. We did it! The end."

68," I stopped to fill up with Gatorade and by 11:04 we (Susie and I) are off on our merry adventure. I rode about 500 metres and the road ran out of shoulder. The road was narrow and the trucks were buzzing me like crazy. I got my front tire in some very loose sand and it slipped out on me. It did not do any harm except my heart nearly stopped and my morale was going downhill fast. I could feel a panic attack coming on strong. I decided to push my bike until the shoulder improved. I was feeling a little like ""what the hell have I done"" syndrome. I was less than a km from my starting place and I am already walking. Very soon the road quality improved and I was now ""on my way"" and feeling much more positive about the trip, myself, and life in general. There were a few hills but nothing of any significance. As I was only doing a short distance I took my time and enjoyed the journey stopping several times just for the fun of it.   Just before Batchwana Bay is the Trans Canada Monument. It is the halfway point of the TCH. I met a man there who was very encouraging and wished me all the best. Nearly everyone I have run into so far in Ontario has been very pleasant. The road just past the monument was rather in need of some serious TLC.   The scenery, especially when Lake Superior came into view, was incredible. The weather was as nice as one could ever imagine. The tornado, wind and rain had been traded in for calm, sunny weather. It did get rather warm in the afternoon so I was glad it as short day. The trip seemed to go by amazingly quickly. I stopped and took pictures several times and really enjoyed not having to worry about my pace. There was a really neat waterfall that I wanted to photograph but there a bunch of young children playing around it and I did not want to upset their parents so I just enjoyed the falls and rode away. I checked into the Shoreline Motel. It was so so at best. I went to the restaurant and it was great. The food and people were awesome. They were talking to me as if I was one of the regulars. They suggested that I go for a swim across the road. It was getting very hot and muggy. I decided to go to my room for a 1/2-hour nap and then woke about 4 hours later. It was raining so hard I thought the place was going to flood. The thunder shook the building. If I had caught out in this weather, my gear would never dry! And for today's road report:The quality of pavement: Excellent: 50% OK: 20% Poor: 20% Very Poor: 8% Hell: 2%"
69,"Saw 3 cyclists today, all riding eastward and solo. The first guy was around my age and very fit. His English was not that great so we had a hard time communicating but I did understand that I was approaching some mighty hilly country. The next cyclist I ran into was much younger and his English was great. His basic message was that I was in for ""my own personal Hell"" very soon. He felt there were stretches coming up that were worse than the Rockies. The third guy was very young and could not speak English at all. He waved energetically and said something that sounded like ""Good voyage."" but I was not sure. He was extremely friendly or perhaps just delirious. He was packing a child carrier with enough gear for several people. My back hurts just thinking about pulling such a load.  All in all, today was a good day. I suffered on the hills and just started suffering in general at about 125 km. My new seat is the pits compared to my original. This seat is not coming with me on my next trip. The road was very good and I was very impressed with the TCH today. The scenery was once again awesome. I either had Lake Superior to look at or, when I was away from Lake Superior, there were many little lakes. Saw a set of lakes that were named: Mom, Dad, and Baby Lake. And now for today's road report:70% excellent, 20% good, 9% fair and 1% poor."
70,"About 10 km short of Wawa some fool had tried to fix the road by dumping asphalt on it and I suspect kicking it around with his/her foot. I lost focus a bit and it nearly cost me. I noticed the garbage on the road and a semi coming way too close both at the same time.  I nearly dumped as I tried to correct. I pulled off the road several times to let the traffic go by as the road was terrible.  At breakfast I met a tourist who had been on the road since last February. He started off from his country (Australia) flew to NZ and is now doing Canada. I really enjoyed talking to him. He had lots to share regarding what I was facing in the short term and the long term. His only complaint about Canada was the high priced, low quality camping that is available. I seldom call down Canada but I had to agree that $22 per night to camp in BC parks with no real services is a bit much.  I was looking at his bike and tried to pick up the back end. Perhaps I had not eaten enough Shreddies that day but I could not lift it.  I could not really put too much effort into it but I was shocked at how heavy it seemed. I met a mom and son combo just a few kms out of Wawa. Mom had a street bike that had gear piled a mile high. It looked mighty heavy to me and particularly well-arranged. Her rather quiet son, who looked to be about 15, was riding an inexpensive full suspension mountain bike. They had started off from S. Ontario and were headed for Edmonton. I hope they are OK and make it. When I left them, they were looking worse for wear and it was probably only 8 am.  I met 2 other cyclists who were doing Vancouver to Toronto. They looked like a father-son combo. They had been on the road for 7 weeks and thought I was crazy with the rate I had set for myself. I am getting so used to being told that I am crazy that if people quit saying that I would think I was being whimpy. They had wandered into the States once and taken other side trips. They obviously had the time so why not. As promised, the trip from Wawa to Marathon was a tough go. There were a lot of nasty hills. The hills go up and then go down right away. There seems to be very little point to spending a long painful time going up a hill just to go down instantly.  For most of the day I felt very strong and felt the km were were adding up at a respectable rate. The first 170 km were pretty good; the last 10 km were hell. I climbed this long nasty hill and kept seeing signs for a ski area. A ski area seemed improbable as we were already nearly as high as you could get around here. Eventually, after a long nasty climb that I thought would never end, I came to the top of the ski lift. I am looking the top of the ski lift right in the eye. I am sure folks who live around there think nothing of it but I have never ridden on a paved road to the top of a ski lift. The top of the ski lift is level with the highway. Weird.  The town of Marathon was off the highway by 4 km so I just stayed at the Best Western. I was glad I did. The room was nice and the food was awesome. Best house dressing I have ever eaten. Every time I have eaten lately, it has been the best food I have ever eaten. Nothing like a hard day of pedaling to get your hunger revved up. I have to get lots of sleep as tomorrow is going to be Hell. Everyone I have talked to has told me the next section is the toughest in my entire trip.  And now for today's road report: Good 50%, Fair 20%, Poor 20% and Hell 10%."
71,"The pavement quality was not too bad at the beginning of the day but got progressively worse as the day wore on. I met several bikers today - they all told me the same thing. You are going too far today and you will not be able to make it that far. I talked to one guy who was going around Lake Superior and another who was doing the Vancouver - Halifax thing. The young man who was going to Halifax and I talked for quite some time. He kept shaking his head telling me that I was taking on a tough journey. He took 2 days to do it and he appeared to about my daughter's age. Don't scare me people!! He was a very friendly young man and we probably chatted for 15 minutes.   Well, I got to Terrace Bay which is about 1/2 way and I was thinking that maybe they were right. It was now 1:30 and the tough part of the journey was ahead of me. Terrace Bay was a beautiful little town. I was very impressed and if I had more time (and any energy) I would have checked it out. However, today is a ""keep her moving"" day. I don't have a headlight and don't fancy being caught out in the dark in unknown country.  I stopped and pumped up my tires a bit so that I could get every advantage possible. I went up the next huge hill from Hell and the energy from my lunch started kicking in and it was OK. There was a flat stretch (just a short one) and I saw an OPP officer had pulled a guy over and was writing him a ticket. I was debating if I should go around them on the left or the right. As I was humming and hawing that major decision, ""BOOM!"" The tube in my front tire had blown up. I have no idea what happened but the noise was so loud it hurt my ears. I was certain the cop was going to hop out of his car with gun drawn and tell me to freeze or die! He apparently did not hear the noise as he never even glanced at me. I fixed the tire. Kevlar tires are so awesome in that you don't need tire levers so the chance of you punching a hole in your new tube is pretty low. I am very slow at any mechanical activity so it probably took more than 15 minutes before I was totally back together. The cop was doing paperwork or something in his car the whole time and never glanced at me or asked me why I was in the ditch 10 metres behind his car. I was rather surprised that he did not seem to care. Perhaps he was more in the punishment part of the job and he was going to ""protect and serve"" the public in the afternoon. To be fair to him, he may have seen that I seem to be breathing and moving about so he left it at that.  So, it is early afternoon and I am mobile once again. The closer I get to Nipigon, the tougher the hills. Some of them are mighty nasty. I think they have a lower grade than what I have experienced in BC but what they lack in grade and distance; they make up for it with volume. One biker said there were 3 hills coming into Marathon. I thought he meant 3 big hills in the total trip. NO! He meant that after you do a million hills, there are 3 tough ones coming into Nipigon. I have had a fair amount of experience with hills but this was a mighty tough go. I have had longer hills, steeper hills but I am not sure if I have ever done so many hills in a day. A couple times I would stop on the hill and curse it. I know that does not sound rational but from the 10th to the 14th hour I was having a rough time. Every time I saw an ad for a motel, I would think...hmmm. Of course, the schedule must be honored so I kept moving. When I got close to town, I could see that there were several hills that I would have to face in the morning. Sorry - you got to do them now. It was arranged for me to stay with Pauline and Sepo (just guessing on the spelling and will fix it as soon as I get home! - apologies) I had this fantasy that they would be on the south side of the town (where I came in) but sorry - other side.   About 5 km short of Marathon, I met a biker who was riding a 'bent. He was really discouraged. His camping gear was wet and he knew his sleeping bag would be wet by the morning. I think he needed to take a day off and get his spirits back up. He was a veteran tourist and mentioned several large tours he already had under his belt. I think he was probably in his early 40's.   I finally staggered into the Husky Gas station and phoned Sepo. He arranged to come and pick me up as he lives down a gravel road. While I was waiting, I swallowed a burger, a piece of pie and 5 or 6 cups of coffee. I was having a hard time walking and until the coffee kicked in, a hard time communicating. I think the waitress thought I was impaired but she seemed to be OK when I told her that I was having a hard time because I had just done a tough ride.  I met Sepo and we talked and drank several cups of coffee. I instantly liked him. By the time I said good night, I knew a lot of his history. He was once out of shape and now he does marathons and cross-country ski racing.   Sepo drove me to his place. He fabricates metal and makes different machinery for logging companies and the like.  In the morning I met his son (3 years old) and his wife. Pauline cooked a nice breakfast. I sat around and visited as I was in no hurry. I had to only do about 80 km. Sepo drove me back to where I had started. He shares some of my personality traits and had no problem understanding why it was important to me that I start exactly where he had picked me up."
72,"The pavement was awful. I was told it is the worse that I will face on this part of the trip. It was Fair 20%, Poor 20%, Very Poor 40% and Hell 20%. All the positive things I had been thinking about the TCH were temporarily dismissed in my mind. The road was dangerous the pavement was so bad. I had a semi blast me with his horn for no apparent reason. I suspect he tries to scares cyclists for some sort or perverse pleasure. Thanks to any trucker who blasts his horn if required but to do it just to try to get me to wipe out is not very reasonable. To be fair, the vast majority of truckers are excellent. However, there are so many trucks that even 0.1% of them being unfit can make for a rather hairy ride. The terrain was very mellow.    I know it is my imagination but it seemed like I basically coasted from Nipigon to Crystal Beach. It must have been my imagination as both places are on the same lake. Needless to say, it was an easy journey and I had the luxury of stopping just for fun and even took a couple pictures of flowers and some wild strawberries. The wild strawberries were tasty but so very very tiny.   I got into Crystal Beach and stayed with Don and Leena. They took very good care of me. They live right on Lake Superior in a beautiful home. Crystal Beach is an amazing area with many fantastic cottages. I spent some time just riding around and looking at the places the area had to offer. I was so very impressed. It was so nice to ride in such a stress free environment. The TCH is many things but stress free does not play into it. And now for today's road report:Fair 20%, Poor 20%, Very Poor 40% and Hell 20%     "
73,"After getting some of my web page caught up, I said goodbye to Leena and headed off to meet Louise in Thunder Bay. Lousie is Frank's girlfriend. I was going to stay at his place but he decided to fly to France for a bike trip. He arranged for me to stay at Louise's place. I took Lakeshore Drive. It runs between Lake Superior and the TCH. The TCH had been so busy and so rough, leaving it was not a problem. Lakeshore was not the greatest road in the world; however, there was very little traffic. The trucks were greatly reduced in number. After an easy ride, I arrived at the outskirts of Thunder Bay. The sky was getting darker by the second. By the time I was actually in town, it was pouring. Surely it must rain normally in Ontario at times. It did its usual violent downpour. After a struggle in the rain I came across Tim Horton's and took refuge. Generally, I have found that if it rains very hard, it won't last long. Apparently that rule does not apply to Ontario as it can rain hard for considerable stretches of time. Louise's place was easy to find and I arrived there in the early afternoon. She provided a goodly supply of cold ones and we sat around and talked. She offered me her computer to update my webpage but her computer and I were not communicating. After a lazy day of cold ones and being waited on, I went to bed as the next day was going to be the longest to date and I needed to be ready and rested. And for today's road report: Good: 70%   Fair 30%"
74,"Louise had given me excellent directions to find my way out of town. I stopped at 7-11 and it was right next to the highway I was looking for - 102. The pavement was good and for the 30 of the 35 km of 102 had great wide shoulders. The shoulder became narrow for the last 5 km but it was still not a problem as the traffic was very light. It was such a relief to get away from the constant buzz of trucks going past.  Where the 102 ends, it runs into 11/17. At the intersection, there was a great biker's restaurant: good food done cheap. Breakfast of French toast with bacon and 2 cups of great coffee was $4.00. What a deal! I was warned that there would be some nasty stretches without services so I at heartily. I also picked up a couple of those lunches of crackers, meat, cheese, and a snack. They are high fat and that is what I needed. This is rural country cyclists, take heed (and take extra food). 11/17 had a bit more traffic and a poor shoulder. Fortunately, the traffic was light and the terrain quite gentle. After a long slug, I finally found a restaurant at about 165 km from Thunder Bay. This is a 100 miles for my American friends. On a poor road, 165 km is considered a slug - trust me. By the time I had found the restaurant I was in need. My food was long gone and my liquids expired about 1/2 hour previous. The restaurant, although I can't remember its name, was awesome. There is only one so if you are passing through on a bike, I really suggest you stop. I had 2 cokes, a salad with a ton of cheese and bacon cheeseburger. I just inhaled it. When I had pulled up to the restaurant, there were 2 Trek 520's and a Cannondale T800. The Treks belonged to an American couple that come up and volunteer in a nearby park. I suspect they are camp hosts - there personality would have suited the task. The Cannondale belonged to a young man doing the traditional West to East trek across Canada. He thought I was crazy to do the route backwards. He had only been a short while on the prairies and vividly recalled the wind. I suspect there may come a day, very soon now, that I agree with his evaluation of my sanity.  After rambling on with the bikers for some time, I headed off. There was still 40 km to Atikokan. The food really helped and the first 3/4 of the remaining distance was done at a good pace. I was surprised that after 165 km, it was still possible to keep up a good pace. Suddenly, I hit the wall. I hit the wall so badly my legs did not seem to realize that I was in charge around here and when I said pedal, I mean pedal hard now. After negotiating with my legs, it was decided that yes, we would keep going but at a much slower pace with frequent stops. Atikokan is located 3 km from the highway. Fortunately, it is slightly downhill or I may have selected a nice ditch to sleep in. It seemed strange that you have to go all the way into town to find motels. They usually like them in a better location. The last km into town was terrible. The road was in serious need of repair. I found a motel and picked it as it had an Internet Cafe. I can't recall the exact rate but it was cheap. I checked my Email and then started working on my web page. After an hour of working on the page, I found that nothing was saving. Perhaps the computer had some type of ""cookie"" protection. Anyway, after a tough day, I did not need any computer hassle so I turned it off and paid my bill and went back to my room. When I got to my room, my gear was strewn all over. My rule is ""pack up before you go to bed"" and the next morning I regretted not following it. I had changed time zones today and was really looking forward to the extra hour of sleep. Still should have cleaned up. And for today's two part road report: Highway 102: 75% Excellent, 25% Very Good. Highway 11/17  Fair 50%, Poor 50% (Light traffic, gentle terrain)"
75,"I had a rather lousy breakfast and then stocked up on food and Gatorade. The clerk at the motel told me that there would be places to eat along the way. Fortunately, I had reports from cyclists that said this was a very lonely stretch. The only choice was Mine Center and it has minimal services at best. I am glad I listened to the cyclists as my very tough day could have turned out far worse.  For the first time on this trip, my energy levels and motivation were very low. The crappy pavement did not help at all.  I knew there would be days that motivation would be a problem.  For the first few hours it rained on me for about 50% of the time. I could not wear my raingear, as the humidity and heat were so high that I would have just expired on the spot. Later it cleared up a bit and the headwind died down. This picked up my spirits notably and also my speed. Did my speed pick up because because my spirits picked up or did my spirits pick up because my speed picked up?  With about 25 km to go, it started to get dark - spooky dark. It was not even suppertime yet but it was dark. I was looking at the sky and was amused at the incredible cloud formation. They were so very dark with patches of an unusual silver color. I can't really give it justice but it was really something to look at. I started to pull over to take a picture of the clouds and one of my still active brain cells said, ""Jimmy, keep moving.""  Thunder started shaking the earth and lightening was entertaining those in vehicles. The rain started to come down. I know that I repeatedly say, ""I have never seen it rain like that before."" However, I have never seen it rain so hard. I had to put on my rain jacket but not zip it up. The rain was coming down so hard I could barely see where I was going. Suddenly, the wind picked up so intensely, that could not ride my bike so I did the next best thing, I started walking the 25 km pushing my bike. This went on for quite a while and then the wind started blowing so violently, I could not even walk safely. I found a huge rock on the side of the road, of which Ontario has plenty, and just hid behind it and watched branches and other bits of debris fly overhead. After a few minutes of this, the rain stepped up its pace and the area I was standing in was soon destined to be a river. The lightening seemed to be right above my head and the thunder just kept on coming. I have never really been that afraid of lightening but this was exceptional. I am holding on to my bike with a aluminum frame in a lightening storm. I promised Susie that I would not leave her to the elements so I started walking again.  I don't really know how long or far I walked but the situation was going downhill fast. The wind was so bad that even walking I had to stop once in awhile and just hold still until it passed a bit. Suddenly, I hear, 3 angels in a pickup stopped and the Angel who appeared to be in charge said, ""Want a ride?""  I had given the chance of being offered a ride some previous thought. I always thought I would be able to say, ""No thanks, I am on a tour and I can't cheat."" Sorry, this was a time to accept help. One of the girls who appeared to be about 15 helped me load Susie in the back. The mom talked non-stop while her 2 daughters sat quietly. She was shocked that I had been out in the storm for a few hours and no one asked if I needed help. I have no idea how she could see where she was going it was raining so hard. She did not seem to care and I thought, ""It is only 5 km so I won't focus on the road."" The mom drove me around to take my pick of motels, angel I'd say.  When I checked into my motel, the clerk was listening to the radio about the storm. She felt sorry for this drenched rat so she gave me the corporate rate. I went to my room and expected to find all of my gear-soaking wet. No, dry as a bone. Serratus makes mighty fine panniers. My handle bar bag is just a cheapie and everything in it was soaking wet. I did not realize it at the time but my Kenora contact number was on one of the sheets. I threw it away to regret it later.  I turned on the Weather Channel and they came on and said that the Ft. Frances tornado watch and been upgraded to a tornado warning. Just then a siren came on.  I had a shower, got changed and went to the restaurant for supper all to the tune of the siren. After I finished eating, I asked why the siren was going on and on and on.... Oh, she answers rather casually, ""There has been a tornado sighted somewhere... want more coffee?"" The cook had turned on the radio and all they talked about was ""take all safety precautions, a tornado has been sighted.""  Finally, they downgraded the tornado warning back down to a tornado watch and everything started getting back to normal. For the first time in the trip, I loaded up with junk food. As I was doing my laundry, I just pigged out. Any fat I may have lost along the way was found in the Tubs and Suds Laundry. I went back to my room with a fresh supply of junk food and turned on the Weather Channel. It stated that Ft. Frances had received 35 mm (1.5 inches) of rain that afternoon. No wonder that when I took my wallet out to pay for my room, it was a soggy mess. Hopefully tomorrow will be better! Tornado or not, you get today's road report:  Poor 80%, Very Poor 10%, and Hell 10%.
"
76,"Got off to a good start with another good, cheap breakfast with great coffee. It was easy to find my way out of town and back to Highway 11. The road was Good 100% until the turn off past Emo. For the first 50 km past the turn off to Sioux Narrows, it was Fair 100%. The saving grace was the traffic was fairly light.  As I was heading down the ""fair"" pavement, the wind, headwind of course, was really starting to become a pain. It was a steady 20 km/h in my face. The sky once again started to get a bit dark. Nothing like yesterday but I was paying very close attention to the sky.  After the 50 km of Fair pavement, it turned to Excellent 50% and Very Good 50% - what a relief. I stopped in a very nice town called Nestor's falls. It is a very fishing oriented town. There were 7 or 8 floatplanes on the lake and ads all over talking about the different trips you could purchase. I stopped in for lunch at the hotel and it was great. I had a couple pints, which greatly slowed down the afternoon's rate of travel but felt mighty fine going down.  I saw a hawk (?) pick up something with its talons. I suspect it was lunch. It flew along the ditch about 1 metre from the ground with its prey. A little further down the road, I saw the hawk sitting in a nest. I took a couple pictures but the bird seemed to be getting annoyed so I thought it would be best to leave her alone and move on.  As the afternoon progressed, it became hotter and hotter. By the time I stopped, it was well past 30 C I am sure. I stayed at the first place that I came to in Sioux Narrows. The cafe and bar both shut down at 8 pm. The TV only had 3 channels but the air conditioner worked and bed was comfortable.  And today's road report: Overall: 33% Excellent,  33% Good, 33% Fair"
77,"As the day went on, the sky became clear and the temperature soared. This has been the muggiest day of the trip so far - I was just dying. I was supposed to travel for hours past Kenora but after a late start and killer temperature and humidity; I decided to cut my day short. Also, when I stopped at the Tourist Center, the lady suggested that motels would be in rather short supply once I left Kenora area - she was right.  The road from Sioux Narrows to the TCH was quite reasonable.  Much of the road had no real shoulder to speak of but the traffic was light so it was a fairly easy go. Being in no hurry, I stopped several times which was very enjoyable. After joining up with the TCH, the shoulder improved but the traffic volume was nasty. I am really glad I decided to take Highway 11 for the detour rather than staying on Highway 17. I saw a few cycle tourists on the other side of the highway but the TCH is not a good place to have a chat so we just waved and carried on. After just a short while on the TCH, I turned down Highway 17 (the detour to miss Kenora is 17A). The traffic was light and the shoulder was mostly OK. When the highway turned into 4 lanes, the shoulder disappeared but I just used the slow lane without any problems.  When I arrived in Kenora, I had lunch at Timmy's and it was good. I checked into Daysland Motel. It was more expensive than what I had been paying but it was very nice. I wrote the paper copy of my journal in the bar and reflected on the fact that I had changed my destination for the day. It was rather a dumb destination ""Ontario Border."" I don't why I picked such a destination.  I have read many journals where the authors talk about how tough Ontario was and how much they disliked it. I realize that I started in the middle of Ontario and perhaps some would find my point of view too positive, but I loved Ontario. I am feeling rather sad to be leaving it but excited to see what Manitoba has to offer.  People asked me if I get bored. I never get bored but occasionally I get very tired. I would do Ontario over anytime the opportunity presented itself. Today's road report: Good 75%,  Fair 25%."
78,"I asked the clerk at the motel which way I should go. For some reason, he suggested I go east on 17, back to the TCH, and then proceed. When I told him that I was actually heading west, he just suggested he thought it was the best way to go. Fortunately, I talked to the lady in a nearby store and she said, ""Go to the next corner and you'll see the sign for 17 west. She was right and it was easy to find my way. Good thing I asked and did not take the clerk's advice as it would have added 40 km to the day.  The road through Kenora and Kewaitin (another town that literally touches Kenora) was great. Once I was back on TCH proper, the traffic increased drastically but fortunately so did the shoulder. I ran into a big chunk of resurfacing and it turned out to be a blessing in disguise. I got to ride on the blocked off side which gave me 2 lanes and a wide shoulder to myself. I had about 1 km that was a bit of a hassle but then they let me on the freshly resurfaced road so I had a bunch more highway all to my self.  Ran into a bunch of cyclists today. I saw a tandem and the stoker (person who is the back) and she appeared to be blind. I ran into another part of the same tour and they told me that yes, they did have a blind member on a tandem. Now, that takes determination. They had just crossed into Ontario border and they had started in Victoria. I suggested that Highway 11 was the better choice over Highway 17 but there trip was set so I did not expect them to make a change at this time based on some somewhat insane solo cyclist.  Thump---thump---thump. My second flat! A piece of wire had worked its way through my back tire and put a slow leak in the tube. Fortunately, from my reading of touring.org, I knew to check for any nasties in the tire. Good thing I did or I would have soon had another flat. I love the Kevlar tires and they area easy to change without tire levers. No tire levers means a better chance I will be able to fix the flat without pinching the tube. Just before lunch it happened - I am in Manitoba.  When I started off in Manitoba, it was great at first and then the shoulder disappeared. Fortunately, the TCH has 2 lanes and very little traffic in Manitoba, so it was not a big deal.  As I got closer to Winnipeg the traffic started picking up notably. Fortunately, as the traffic started getting real heavy, the shoulder reappeared. A small shoulder but a shoulder none-the-less.  The first place I visited in Manitoba was Falcon Lake. I had lunch there and was seriously thinking of staying. It was a very nice, tourist town. However, I did not think I could relax knowing I had done another ""less than 100 km day."" I headed out on the TCH and if people tell that much of Manitoba is flat and the roads straight, believe them. My bike computer's remote sensor battery died so I am not sure how fast I was averaging but it seemed good. I took my time and stopped for no real reason and still did the first 85 km in about 4 hours.  Road report  The Ontario section of the TCH was Excellent 100%. Manitoba section was Good 20% and Fair 80%     "
79,"Got up and mobile at a reasonable time today. After another bacon and eggs breakfast, I was on my way. The weather looked a bit nasty but it cleared up as time went on. By the time I was actually in Winnipeg, it was turning into a humid scorcher. There was a slight headwind at first but it turned into a cross wind and at times, felt like a ""bit"" of a tailwind. It did not take very long to drive to the outskirts of Winnipeg. My computer is still out of commission so I am not sure of my speed but it felt pretty good.  There is no shoulder on the TCH at first but it is a divided highway with 2 lanes going each way. As the traffic increased, the shoulder eventually became wide enough to use. As I got close to the outskirts of Winnipeg, there were a few areas that were not much fun to drive through. There was one area that had a minimal shoulder with guardrails. There was lots of debris on the side and trucks screaming by. I stopped, waited for a gap in traffic and just went for it when I could. Going past exits and on ramps was a little unnerving as well. In Manitoba, there are no warnings for bicycles telling where to cross when safely.  When I finished lunch, I phoned Ross and Laverne's place. Laverne and I miscommunicated and I wound going the long hard way. I had no problem with the distance, what's an extra 10 km or so. It was the truck traffic on the road. I wound up walking and riding in the gravel with my 25's. Anyway, I finally made it and Laverne had a cold one ready. Ross came home and we celebrated my arrival with liquid refreshments and supper. I ate heartily and had more liquid refreshments. At about 1 or so, I faded into the twilight zone and crashed. Today is Saturday and I am catching up on my journal, Email, and sleep. I was going to do the laundry but Laverne is doing it for me as I write. Thanks Ross and Laverne - much appreciated. Today is Saturday and my rest day. I have been working on catching up on my journal and doing my Email. My plan is to take it very easy today as tomorrow is going to be a 100+ mile day. Ross and Laverne looked at my schedule and think that I  have bitten off one tough journey. Road Report: The TCH to Winnipeg is Fair 100%."
80,"Got off to a great start. Ross and Laverne drove me to the TCH - I did not have to wander through the maze of streets - thanks! My tummy was bulging; my Gatorade nice and cold; and my stash of gel and powerbars were full. As I left on the TCH, I kept thinking what Ross and Laverne had told me about the Yellowhead in Manitoba: single lane with no shoulder. My plan was to switch to Highway 16 (Yellowhead) at Portage La Prairie. For some dumb reason, I had no information on this highway or any roads in Manitoba. Just to set the tone for the day, I was presented with an evil sign: Pave Shoulder Ends. The traffic was very heavy and much of it trucks. I drove on the gravel for a bit but the shoulder soon became so steep that it was impossible to continue. I had to stake my share of the slow lane. Many of the trucks were not feeling that generous on a Sunday morning and I was buzzed several times. Why a truck driver would blast you with his air horn instead of just using the passing lane is beyond me. Don't get me wrong; the vast majority of the professional drivers were excellent. Unfortunately, it is the evil ones that stick in your mind. I arrived in Portage La Prairie. I had stopped at the tourist bureau and the lady suggested that Highway 16 scares her when she drove her car on it. The trucks are plentiful and there is no paved shoulder at all. I had lunch at Timmy's and was feeling a little down. I thought to myself, I have to go on the planned route, as that is the way it is planned.  The wind had pounded me all day and it ranged from 20-40 km/h. It was a cross wind but it was really moving me around which is rather spooky when you don't have a shoulder. Also, just to further bum me out, my overpriced battery lasted 7.63 km on my bike computer.  While I was eating at Timmy's, 2 young native boys were interested in my bike and all the gear. I should have engaged them in conversation but I was feeling too sorry for myself. When I left Timmy's, they were traveling with their dad in their car right along side of me. They would wave at me and each time I waved back they would have a giggle attack. It was the only positive thing that had happened to me for several hours. I got to the start of the Yellowhead and it was worse than I had dared to imagine. There was a sign suggesting you slow to some turtle crawl speed to avoid spraying other drivers with rocks and breaking their windshield. How many truckers are going to slow down to prevent me from being sprayed with rocks. I take it as a personal favor when they avoid running me down. It was a long way and I was afraid that I would wind up walking massive sections. Looking up at the sky, it was getting darker by the moment and it was barely past lunch. The humidity was nasty and the wind was still howling.  I had this fantasy that if the wind blew it could not be muggy. Yeah right! I took out my map and the wind made it nearly impossible to read or to fold up properly. I was feeling frustrated, annoyed, and a bit worried. Finally, I decided that the TCH would be the best choice. This is the first time I went off my planned route. When I hit the TCH, I was presented with a beautiful sight: smooth, wide shoulders. The wind seemed to be shifting and giving hints that it would like to become a tailwind. It never really turned into a tail wind but at least it was not an evil headwind. Within minutes of being back on the TCH, I was filled with joy. The sun peaked out a bit, the wind was less evil, and the shoulders were a thing of true beauty. Soon I was singing at the top of my voice and pedaling as hard as my little legs would allow. The shoulder went back to minimal but never disappeared. When you have no shoulder, even a 2-foot shoulder seems like a gift from Heaven. As I got closer to Brandon and the traffic picked up, the shoulder became wider once again. I almost stopped in Carberry. There was a motel about 1/2 km back on the opposite side of the TCH. The town was quite a bit off the highway so I decided to keep on going - it was only 40 more km and I would be able to do that in 2+ hours. I was starting to tire but managed a few more rallies. When I was confident that I had done in excess of 100 miles I stood up and cranked it. It was silly, it was childish, but it was fun and made me giggle and sing even louder. My mind was fried but my legs felt strong. Having a complete day of rest made a big difference. Finally, I got to Brandon. There were a couple of motels right on the highway and the restaurant I could see was Macs. I had ridden too far to eat at Macs. I wanted a steak and a few pints. I took the road into town, mostly downhill and in serious need of repair. True to form, it had no shoulder. I rode the 5 km into town and the only place to eat in the area was KFC - ouch. My fantasy was ""steak and pints"" and my reality was ""KFC and pop."" When I came back to the motel, I was going to check out the pub they had. I was told they did not have food but I was confident they had beer. I never went in. The place was crawling with very young people. You can drink at 18 in Manitoba. The clientele appeared to be about grade 9 and 10. I am sure they just looked young and all had legal ID but there was little appeal for me. I went back to my room and stared mindlessly at the TV until I fell asleep. Before Portage La Prairie the road was fair mixed with Hell.Past Portage La Prairie the road varied from Excellent to Good.Unless things have changed since July 2003, I would avoid Highway 16."
81,"Had lunch in Virden and asked several groups of people what the road was like between Virden and the Saskatchewan border. Some thought it was worse in Saskatchewan and others thought Manitoba was worse. They all had one common thought: STAY OFF 16. The last group I talked to said none of the roads were that great but the TCH was the best choice. As any other choice would have involved secondary roads, I stuck with the TCH. Perhaps the people I talked to have higher standards than I do but it was not bad at all. It was neither muggy nor hot and even the evil wind seemed to be taking a bit of time off. I was a bit bagged from yesterday's massive effort. I stopped at a dollar store to pick up some stuff to clean Susie's chain. She has been doing extremely well but her chain needed some serious TLC. The pace I have set for myself between here and Lougheed is bordering on insane. I may allow sanity to prevail and add an extra day. I could sure use a tailwind. I arrived in Moosomin fairly early compared to my usual. The motel was great. It had a computer set up in the office so you could check your Email for free. Four of the rooms are wired for Internet access for business people who travel with their laptops. The manager offered me a beer, which I accepted readily. He suggested I go across the street to the restaurant. I had a great steak. I ate there in the morning and it was a good breakfast. The motel is called Prairie Pride and if you need a motel in Moosomin, I highly recommend the place.
"
82,"By 2 pm, the wind had the decency to turn from a head wind to a crosswind. For the first 100 km, the road was fair with a reasonable shoulder. It would have received a better rating but I ran into death strips (rumble strips). On the newer sections they do a nice job with the death strips. They have them close to the line and quite narrow. The older sections were done sloppily. About 60% of the shoulder was useless. Around Grenfell, I ran into 20 km of construction. The machines were kicking up a dust cloud that was huge. This was one time I was glad I had a cross wind or I would have been in the dust storm for over an hour. They are changing the 2-lane relic into a brand new 4 lane super highway. From Worsely, which calls itself, ""Town around a lake"" (must be a tiny lake as I did not see it) to Indian Head, the road was excellent. After Indian Head, the road got so bad I did about 2 hours on the left shoulder. I was wondering if it was legal for me to ride there but the cop who drove by did not say anything. A young man in a truck amused himself by going by me at high speed and just missing me by a foot.  I had supper at Indian Head. I ran into an older man who told me a 15-minute story. I was very behind where I should have been but he seemed so I listened. I have several tips though if I should win a significant sum of money in the United States. By 6 I was back on the road and the temperature was violent and it did not really start to cool down until 8:00. Around 2 this afternoon, Susie developed a problem. It seems that the spokes on the front tire are too loose. I suspect it needs to be trued. It is making a scary noise. I have to find a bike store in Regina tomorrow. It might even turn into an unplanned rest day. Right now I am so fried from the sun and wind that I don't even care. I stopped in McLean to find a room. Two men were leaning against a truck and shooting the breeze. When I asked them about a room, they suggested I would be much better off going to Bagoline as what they had to offer was ""questionable"" at best. Bagoline was only 15 km so I started off once again. I wanted to keep moving as the daylight seemed to be in short supply. When I arrived the motel in Bagoline, I was glad I had made it, as it was nearly dark. As I looked for a place to park Susie, the manager came out and told me they were full. Ouch! I asked how far the next motel was located and she said 15 minutes - more ouch. I asked if she knew how many miles or km and she said 5 miles. OK, so either she does not know the distance or can't estimate time very well. Those numbers don't agree with each other. I had no time to teach the woman how to estimate so I headed off for White City. Very soon I ran into a sign that said it was 8 km to White City. The highway was excellent from Bagoline to White City. I pushed it for all I was worth and was starting to get worried and it was really starting to get dark. I came across a campground with cabins called ""Dyer Straights."" Well, that name had some significance to me as I was in a situation with a very similar name. I rode into the campsite and got an over priced cabin. The cabin was quite nice but it had no TV, AC, or running water. I have never been so pleased with so little. There was no place to eat so I had a few slugs of warm Gatorade, did the paper version of my journal and feel into a deep sleep. I seemed to get a better sleep without AC. By 11:00 pm I actually shut one of the windows.
"
83,"This morning, I got up and off to a good start. I looked up and copied down all the names of the bike stores complete with addresses and phone numbers last night. I did the 18 km to Regina and stopped at Husky for breakfast. It was good and the coffee was to die for. I showed my waitress the list of bike stores and asked which would be the easiest to find. When she saw ""Blocks Saw and Cycle"" she said, ""They are the best."" She drew me a map but the place was easy to find without the map. By coincidence I had picked the same place as I had found it on my map. My plan was to be their when they oppened so I could plead my case. At 8:50 I arrived and the owner (Daryl) was already working away. He took one look at Susie and I and asked, ""Doing the Canada thing?"" I briefly explained my trip and my problem. He immediately put Susie up on the stand and began to work on her. I am certainly glad that I picked Block's. He fixed the front tire, adjusted the brakes and began to give the drive train a quick tune. He showed me a problem I had not noticed: the rear hub was fried. I mean fried.  He started working on it but it was not one he was used to using. He went on the Net and got Cannondale's number and asked for help. As the number was from the East, the tech guy was ""out for lunch."" I decided to go out for lunch myself. When I returned, Daryly was busily installing a Deore hub - cheap but it would do for the couple thousand km. If you are ever in Regina and need your bike fixed, go to Block's - the man is the patron saint of bicycles. In just over 2 hours and less than $80 I was back on the road.  At Block's I met a man who has done bike tours all around the world. His latest thing is working for some ""cancer prevention"" group. He has committed himself to crossing Canada for the next 10 years in a row. I have officially lost my ""crazy"" status. The man makes me look conservative. There must be something I could do..... Susie felt very sweet and rode beautifully. I got on Highway 11 and did the 31 km to Lumby in record time. I had a tail wind, a gentle slope, and I was cranking it as hard as I could. My computer was not working but I felt that I was flying. The road was good, the wind at my back and my bike was ready to go. There are actually hills in Saskatchewan. They are not that steep but with the sun trying to bake your brains, they seem kind of steep.. The road from White City to Regina is excellent. I don't care for driving through cities and Regina is no exception. The 31 km from Regina to Lumbly is Very Good. From Lumbly to Bethume it is Fair but nice and wide. From Bethume to Craik the road varried between Good and Fair. As mentioned earlier, I am doing the paper version of my journal sitting in the museum grounds hiding under a tree. I went back to the Co-op and settled on ice tea and water. I headed off and decided the first place I come to is home for the evening. I don't know the exact temperature by the time I got back on the road. All I know is that Bethume had a high of 36 C that day. When I got to Chamberlin, I spotted a sign that said: Motel. Well, the lady who ran the bar was surprised I thought that the place was a motel. I was thinking of mentioning the sign but wanted her knowledge so I saw no mileage in saying, ""Well, sorry for confusing you for a motel. I guess it was the sign that said 'MOTEL' that threw me off."" I asked her where the next place was and she said ""Craik."" She also warned me that it was not the next town but the second town. There was a sign a short ways down the road and it said: Craik 28 km. Now 28 km is not a big deal. Not even 2 hours by bike. However, I was fried and the wind was being extremely rude. It was not a head wind but it was a hell of a cross wind. About 8 km from the town I could see the place and it seemed to take forever to get there. In Saskatchewan, you can often see the town long before you get there. When I was about a km away I could see a flashing sign: Motel. I stood up and just cranked Susie for all I was worth. By the time I got to the motel, I was covered in sweat and had kind of lost my mind. I could not really see as my eyes were covered in sweat and sun block. I put on my reading glasses and got them covered with sweat and sun block and could see nothing. The owner helped me clean my glasses so I could fill out the registration. By this time, my mind had really slipped a gear and I could not stop laughing. I tripped over the carpet - didn't fall but amused the owner greatly. The manager said, ""I am just sitting out back having a beer. Would you like me to bring you one to your room."" Five minutes after I get to my room, the manager brings me a beer: cold Canadian. It was too late to get anything to eat so I went to bed hungry. I had gone over to a gas station that sold chocolate bars but they did not appeal to me at all. There was a guard dog who perhaps thought I smelled funny. He decided to get nasty. I turned around and told him to W$$@#%$^%# and mellow out. For some reason he ran away. The last thing I need is a dog ripping at my legs. I had a bath and a shower. The water was so hard that the soap would not lather. I would up scrapping the oil and sun block off my legs with my fingernails. The sun block seemed to be making my skin itchy.  It was a long hard day and when I lay down on the bed, I was asleep in minutes."
84,"I slept in until about 6:45. I went to what I thought was a resturant - no, it was actually a building covered with weeds. I debated on just pushing on to the next town but felt empty as last night's supper was warm gatorade. I was directed by a lady to the resturant that was still open. The resturant had seen better days. The coffee was lousy and the breakfast was not much better. The company was great. I was talking to an older couple and the lady was quite interested. For someone who had never done a long trip, she seemed to understand what I was facing. She knew that the wind must make life pretty tough at times. I paid the bill and went 20 m down the road and a lady stopped me. She wanted to know the details of my trip and then proceeded to tell me about several other bike groups and indviduals that she had talked to recently. I am sure my story will be shared with the next cycle tourist she meets. The lady was very senior but extremely sharp. Hope someone says that about me some day. I finally got going and decided that Saskatchewan was the friendliest place I had ever toured. In resturants, people often include you in coversations as if you had been friends for years. The road had a wide shoulder from Craik to Asquith. However, it was quite rough in spots. I would rate it as Good 50% and Fair 50%. Sometimes, the rough stuff robbed you of almost all of your speed. Speaking of momentum robbing, the wind bugged me all day. It varied from 45 degrees to my right to about 90 degrees on my right. It was a fair breeze and I estimate the wind speed to be about 20 km/h. As I was in no hurry, I stopped several times. It was 30 C out today which would normally be mighty hot for me as I can't tolerate the sun that well. After yesterday, it was not a problem. I stopped in Davidson and had second breakfast. The breakfast and the coffee restored my faith in rural Canadian cooking. It was deluxe. I arrived at the outskirts of Saskatoon just about supper time. The traffic was heavy and it was still pretty warm. There were some large maps on roadside signs. They made some nice looking shade so I had a short map. I woke up a short time later and decided I had best get moving. I studied my map (which I must have left there - ouch!) and studied the maps on the signs. The route to get onto 14 West was easy enough. I travelled through some tough traffic and finally found the road I needed. Small problem: no bikes allowed. That forced me through town on 5 West. After some confusion, I stopped and asked for directions. The first man apologized 50 times for not knowing the way. The next guy I asked gave me good directions on how to get through the city and onto 14 West. Going through the city was the pits but I really enjoyed looking at the universities and colleges. My plan was to drive to the western edge of Saskatoon and be in a good position in the morning to roll. Well, for some reason, there were no motels on the west edge on Highway 14. After a bit, I had to admit to myself that there were not going to be any motels so you might as well face reality and make a decision. I have this thing for going over ground I already covered. Perhaps I ought to rethink that travel strategy. I came upon a sign: Asquith 38; Biggar 91. Ouch, this is not good. I was already committed. In my paperwork, I have a sheet that tells me if there is a motel in the smaller towns. However, I never looked at it. There was no phone for me to phone ahead to reserve a room. What good would it do to know that there was nothing in the next town? Would that increase my morale and encourage me to pedal faster - I think not. I just kept on going. At about 9:45 I put on my ""tiny"" headlamp. It appears to be very bright and I am sure it was useful in that cars coming towards me could see me more easily. I have a good tail lamp and people gave me a wider berth than they generally did during the day. As far as the light illuminating my way, it was next to worthless. I could see my front tire and the time on the bike computer. Yes, my front tire is still there and yes I am an idiot for being out at this time. I had thought of a clever way of mounting my light to my aero bar. It was so clever it did not work. The first bump that I hit caused the light to want to leave the bike. Here I am trying to rescue my light and the bike is threatening me with a trip to the ditch. Fortunately, the bike, the rider, and the light all survived. Finally, after what seemed like a lifetime, I came upon a sign: Asquith 1 km. Driving in the dark is an extremely slow affair. As you can't see debris or potholes, you got to go slow. Whem I got closer I could see what I thought the town had to offer: nothing. Ouch, this did not look good - the only business I saw was a closed gas station. From the highway, I could not see any lights of signs of life. Then, I saw a car drive down the street and stop and what appeared to be a store. I rode down to where the store was and saw a hotel. It was the old fashioned ones where they have room up above. I went into the bar and asked for a room. After a bit of confusion, I got a room. It was only $21 which made me a bit suspicious. However, my other option was sleeping in a ditch so I took it happily.  I was given a key and then asked the room number. The bar tender replied, ""Take anyone you want."" I must have looked quite stunned as the manager appeared at that time and offered to show me the way. I told her that I had to bring my bike into my room. She thought I meant a motorcycle but was OK with my bike. The room was a no star affair. I walked into the room and it had a bare bulb hanging from the ceiling. It was a least 40 C in the room. I put Susie to bed and went down to have a beer - it had been a tough day. A young man, who seemed to have some sort of position at the hotel joined me for quite a while. He would ask questions about my trip and then laugh until he almost choked. He suggested I have as many beers as I could as my room was not going to cool off. I followed his advice. I told the young man that I had lost my map. He went and got one of his and showed me the route. The other bar tender went around to each table to get an idea of which towns would have a motel. Several people started to talking to me and sharing what they knew of the towns ahead. Beer must make you smarter as their information was far more accurate than I usually got from the locals. After the bar closed, I went upstairs to face the heat. Oh, it was hot. The bed had a pre WWII look but was surprisingly comfortable. I was sound asleep in minutes. I woke up in the morning covered with sweat but glad I was not laying in a ditch. The ditch would have been warm enough if I used all my clothing and rain gear. However, how many bugs would want to take a nibble of a cyclist in the wee hours? Mental Note: Get a proper light or stop earlier in the day. Last night I had warm gatorade for supper and tonight I had a bag of peanuts and several Canadian."
85,"When I got to the street, I was surprised to see a store open at 7 am. The store even had Power Ade. The lady directed me to the only resturant that was open at that time of day. The coffee was terrible and the food was worse. As I was picking at my food, I noticed the sky became incredibly dark. The darkness seemed to move across the ground. Normally, I would have not mentioned it and just thought, ""You got to rest more boy, you are seeing things."" But, the table next to me noticed it too and once of them guys asked, ""Is that an optical illusion?"" It was might strange. I got on my bike and started off with nasty black clouds and a 20/30 km/h wind. I had decided that it was going to be a short day. When I got to Biggar, I had lunch and was seriously tempted to stay in Biggar as the wind was becoming ignorant. It was 40 - 50 km/h and complete head wind. Then the rain started coming down. In Saskatchewan it is so dry, I did not mind the rain. I wore my light rain jacket and was just fine. The next town was Landis and it was only 40 km. I should have been able to do it in just over 2 hours. After 5 hours I arrived to find, ""We used to have a motel but we don't anymore.""  ""Oh!"" I replied, trying not to sound too disappointed. I found that the next choice was Wilkie and it was 31 km away. I stopped on the side of the road just outside of Landis to try to give myself a pep talk to get going once again. I noticed that the rain was stopping and the wind was going much slower. The road was freshly paved. The shoulder had not been done but I went to Kindergarten and know how to share. I thought that the sun was even trying to poke through the clouds. With a smile I got back on the bike thinking that 30 km is child's play. Well, the wind had not stopped. It just seemed like that as Landis is a bit lower than the surrounding area and somewhat protected from the wond. The road was only repaved for 2 or 3 km. On a positive note, I felt the wind was only doing about 40 km and had actually shifted to a cross wind. I was convinced that the wind would turn into a tail wind - it didn't but I could live with a cross wind much easier than I could have lived with another few hours of a head wind. The roads today varied from Good to Hell. Right out of Asquith it was quite decent. The rest of the way was not good. Some parts almost felt like seal coat and that stuff just robs you of any speed. There were parts that had huge gaps and rough spots. The cars did not have it much better. In once place, the cars had worn a grove of at least 8 inches. A motorcycle would be well advised to exercise extreme caution. The last few km into Wilkie, the road went completely to the Hell category. There does not appear to be any rule about how bad a road can be in Saskatchewan. If I was the Lord of the land, my rule would be that the Minister of Highways and Transportation has to do a 1000 km trip each summer in their own province. What would they say against it? Would you say the roads are too dangerous; our business are not worth supporting and my family would rather go to the USA; I don't belive in setting good models for healthy living and would rather go to the bar and smoke and drink; or... (Forgive me I was stressed when I came up with the plan.) Finally I got to Wilkie. My room was reasonable and at a reasonable price. I started to walk downtown and after quite a ways, I asked someone where the resturant was located. It was far enough away that I went back for Susie. I unloaded her and rode downtown. The exterior resturant needed painting badly. The food was awesome - the ginger beef was a good as I have ever eaten. After a couple of Canadians, I left feeling much better. My bike felt so incredibly light. I got on it and for a few seconds, I forgot that I was an old fat guy and just cranked it. The bike screamed through the quite neighbourhoods of Asquith. I felt like I could have set a new sprint record for myself. I was wishing some punky teens would have driven by so I could have kicked their butts. When I got back to the room, I had an overwhelming desired to lay down. I guess the sprint must have taken more out of me than expected and my little ""lay down"" turned into a 4 hour nap. I woke up, got undressed and went back to bed.   "
86,"The first 10+ km were straight, up a slight grade and decked out in brand new pavement. Oh, it was sweet. After the new pavement was no more, the entire road to Alberta was Good to Fair. Even the fair sections were not so bad as the traffic was light. About 20 km short of Macklin, I came across a young tour cyclist from Peterbourgh Ontario - Ryan. We traveled together for 20+ km. Ryan's load was so big he made a perfect wind break.  He was headed for Yellowknife. His bike was totally loaded down and he was talking about getting bigger panniers for the front. His rear panniers were much larger than mine. He was riding with 37 mm Conti that he had worn totally bald. He likes to ride gravel and combined with the weight of his load it was deadly on his tires. He was headed for Yellowknife and thought he should invest in rain gear and warmer clothes. Ryan, I can only wish you good luck and please check on the conditions you will be facing. The NWT is not like S. Ontario! We went into Macklin for lunch and then parted company. I expect to see him again some day.  Provost was around 20 km from the Alberta border. When I hit Alberta, the quality of the roads improved incredibly. The roads seemed to all are going downhill. I just ripped into Provost. My 25 mm Kevlar's (skinny tires) just flew on the smooth Alberta pavement. Actually, by Alberta standards, Highway 13 is not that great. By Saskatchewan and Manitoba's standards, they were a work of art. I got a good motel: it has a restaurant and lounge in the same complex. The restaurant opens at 5:30, which is excellent. Mind you, tomorrow will be an easy day so it is unlikely I will need such an early start.           guestbook     "
87,"The road was sweet and traffic was light. I stopped several times for no apparent reason. It is nice to just stop, reflect on life, and listen to the bugs and the birds.  Had lunch at a little resturant in Hughhenden. The food was fine but what I really enjoyed is that they had a good TV music station. It is amazing how much I miss music. I had a couple extra cups of coffee just so I could enjoy the tunes. I headed off and made Lougheed in about 6 hours from when I started - including all the breaks I took just for sport. I will be staying with family for several days and I am looking forward to the rest. I am confident that the rest will be good for me. I am looking forward to getting going with well rested legs. The next bit of the trip is one that I have done both ways just last year. I have this idea that if I really hammer, I could take a day off the time. Or, I could just enjoy myself."
88,"My brother-in-law suggested that I use an alternate route. Instead of heading west on 13 that I should got north on 870 and then head west on 14. Highway 14 has much wider shoulders than 13. After I get to Sherwood Park (part of Edmonton) take 21 North to Ft. Saskatchewan and then head west on Highway 15. This route takes you to Highway 37 and then runs into Highway 43. If I stick to the new plan, I will shave a day off my travel time. Also, I have the chance to ride where I have not ridden before. The entire route was: Excellent 50%, Fair 45%, and Fair 5%. There were a couple places where rumble strips were most annoying. There were a couple places where the repair crew really needs to visit. Today, the roads, wind, and weather, were as much in my favour as any day of my trip. As the day wore on, it got hotter and maxed out around 31 C. In the afternoon I had a serious nap under a tree. I have no idea how long I slept but I felt good when I woke up. As I was riding along, I thought the bike was getting sluggish. Shortly thereafter I had flat #3. I suspected that I had a very slow leak and the tire got too soft resulting in a pinch flat. I really should have checked as soon as I suspected there was something amiss. However, after enough hours in the hot sun, it is hard to consistently make wise decisions. The Kevlars are easy to change and I was soon on my way. I got into Ft. Saskatchewan and got a nice motel room. It is located in a massive complex of fast food outlets. There was some question as to if there would be a room for me. It was only 7:30 but there was very little room at the inn. Fortunately, there was a room and I was soon cleaned up and ready to do some serious eating. I went to Pizza Hut and they did not disappoint. I was wolfing down their generous portions, I thought this would not be the type of meal you would want to eat if you had driven a car all day. The dinner must have been in the 2000 calorie range. I had 'biker's appetite' and it was not a problem. Right now I feel rather bagged, as it was a long day. I was only on the road for 12 hours but it got a bit warm in the pm and it took its toll on my old body. I think I'll lie on the bed and change channels aimlessly.
"
89,"The young clerk at check out was apparently only doing the clerk job as a temporary measure and is really a comic awaiting a gig. She asked me about my trip and then proceeded to tell me that there was no way I could make it. It was too far, the traffic was too heavy, and it was going to be nasty hot. She then told me not to worry as there was a nasty wind predicted. This struck her as very funny and she howled amused by her own clever wit. The clerk promised that she'd watch for me on the side of the road when she travels to BC in 3 weeks. She was still laughing as I was heading out the door.  I asked for directions to Highway 15 from a group of men getting their early Timmy fix. I have developed a habit of asking different people for directions to the same place and found it saves a costly misunderstanding. I found Highway 15 easily but was soon regretting taking this route. Neither 15 nor 37 are designed for safe bicycle travel. The shoulder is nearly nonexistent and it has a very sharp drop off. The paved shoulder is about a foot higher than the gravel and is sloped at a nasty angle. Drift off to the right side of the road and you'll be requiring first aid. Drift off to the left side and you won't be requiring first aid but that is a different issue. My mind drifted while I was playing shadow puppets with my helmet. If I held my head in a certain way, my helmet looked like a surreal ET. I nearly drove off the right side of the road looking at an alien growing out of my head. After I quit shaking, I vowed to stay focussed.  Exiting stage right would not have anything positive for my complexion. My mind was turning to mush and I was infinitely amused. At about 10 am, I was slogging up a hill and seemed to having more problems that I expected. After I made it to the top of the hill, I checked the tire and it was probably at half pressure. After pumping up the tire and hoping the tube would magically fix itself, I carried on. I carried on for a short while and realized that the magic cure was not happening today. I stopped and took the rear tire off and decided that I had to deal with the issue. I examined the inside of the tire and it was fine. The problem was that after 5000 km (3000 km loaded) the Kevlar just wore out. There were several stretches three to six inches long that were basically shot. I put on the Continental Ultra 3000 Kevlar. What a sweet tire. It looks like it will wear much better. The tire only has Kevlar on the sidewall and the tire that makes contact with the road is rubber. I have had very good success with regular Continentals. After putting the dead tire in my pannier, I checked the front tire. It looked like it had a bit of life left in it but this is its last trip.  After a rather tough go, I had lunch in Onoway. This is where 37 merges into 43. Highway 43 in this area is mostly Good with the occasional bit of Unbelievably Good thrown in for good measure. The shoulder could me used as an airport runway in a pinch.  Highway 43 heads northwest. The change in direction gave me a tail wind making pedalling optional. My Gatorade supply was topped up, I had just eaten, the wind was at my back, and the road was a thing of true beauty. Also, I was now back in the travelling grove. It is one of those things where you feel the entire force of the universe is focussed on serving your best interests. Perhaps this only happens to cyclists in the hot sun.   As the day progressed, the temperature soared. The universe had gone from serving my best interest to trying to turn me into a grease spot on the side of the road. The sky started to cloud over and I thought relief was in sight. Sorry, combine soaring heat with dark clouds and you have humidity problems. The sky kept getting darker and darker and the humidity went crazy. The sun poked through and the smell reminded me of working in a greenhouse as a child. I felt like I needed to get out the greenhouse for a second to catch my breath.  Just outside Mayerthorpe, I had stopped for a rest next to a roadside map. Within a few minutes the lightening and thunder started. It was the kind of thunder that seems to just keeping coming and coming. The temperature dropped 10 degrees and it started to rain. I used this as a good excuse to stop at Mayerthorpe instead of soldiering on to White Court. Mayerthorpe is a small town of 1700 people. The only motel choice was reasonably priced so I got a room. The clerk suggested I go to the Lariat restaurant, which I did and pigged out once again. I stopped at a store to get more Gatorade and picked up a Scientific American so I would not be tempted to stare mindlessly at the TV. If you have been on the road for several weeks and your brain has been mushified, a magazine like Scientific American is probably not the best choice.
"
90,"The roads varied form Excellent 25%, Good 25%, and Fair 25%. The highway is totally twinned from Mayerthorpe to past Fox Creek. The side going north is the old pavement. Some of the road had rumble strips that made most of the shoulder mostly worthless. This was most annoying when going downhill as it prevented me from going very fast. If something gets in the way such as gravel, rubber from a truck tire, or a big gap in the pavement, you don't want to be going very fast if the swerving options are limited. Coming into White Court, a young man rode with me for a while. He asked me about my trip and said 'Wow!' in all the appropriate places. He sped off and I made my way into White Court hoping to find a Timmy's for lunch. White Court has the busiest Timmy's I have ever visited. There were 13 cars lined up in the Drive Thru. There must have been 12 people in front of me in the line up inside. I came to the conclusion that the 200+ km was going to require lights and a massive dose of energy. Having neither lights nor the required energy I decided that Fox Creek would be just fine. I took it very easy all afternoon. If the mood struck me, I stopped. There was no real reason to stop except that I felt like it. I have no trouble relaxing on the side of the highway listening to the grass grow and the insects buzz. The vegetation on the side of the road may appear to be weeds to the average commuter but if you examine them closely you find a wide assortment of wild flowers. The wind was not on my side today. Pretty much a 20 km/h headwind all day. 20 km/h is not the end of the world but it really starts to wear on you after 12 hours or so. Up ahead I could see a sign and was convinced that it was going to say: FOX CREEK 2 KM. I felt pretty good that I had just had a lazy day and was already at my destination. Yeah right! The sign did say Fox Creek but the number was different: FOX CREEK 34 KM. Not having a bike computer sure throws me off. 32 km is only about 2 hours but if you think you are ready to quit riding 2 hours seems like a long haul. Today was a good day. As yesterday was a pretty easy day, my legs and spirits were both in good shape. The blue sky and cooler temperatures made it a relatively relaxing day.  Fox Creek is the land of Motels. It is a small town and the number 1 reason for its existence appears to provide a home for a slew of motels. The clerk wanted to hear my entire story and just stared at me and shook her head. She asked if she could ask me a personal question. She asked me how old I was and was shocked that I was as old as her father and could bike all day.  Right now it is shower and suppertime. My motel has laundry facilities so I did my laundry as well. By the way, if you put any wet sweaty clothes in a plastic bag in a hot pannier, you are not wearing them again until they are washed. There are no exceptions to this rule. My shirt (to me) smelled relatively OK when I put it in the bag last night. Today when I took it out to wash it I was not sure if one wash cycle was going to do the trick. It must have been good quality soap as the wash came out OK.   "
91,"There seems to be a nasty hill missing between Fox Creek and Valley View. I am sure it was here last time I passed through. All day I expected the hill to be just around the bend. I really took it easy today. There would be those among us who would think I took it too easy. I stopped for no reason except to watch the rivers flow by, to engage in conversation with a herd of cattle, or just to listen to the insects buzz. The weather was very cooperative today. Had a slight wind that was either a crosswind or a headwind. It was so light that it was of no consequence. It was cool enough to wear my vest all morning. I never really got too hot today which is not bad for Alberta in early August.  Today was a great day! It was more like a holiday than a bike ride. Everything seemed to be geared to making my life easy making me feel totally blessed yet once again. It is funny how you can travel in a car and it is a bit dull. Travel in the elements and have one thing go your way and you are convinced that the universe is making a point of ensuring that you are personally pampered. Tomorrow will be another easy day.
"
92,"The road was great. Although much of it has not been twinned, it was in good shape anyway. The terrain has been getting steadily hillier since yesterday. Today is the peak as tomorrow is reasonably flat once again. The wind was a bit nasty although it paled in comparison to the other two times I ventured this way. It is a short ride but when the wind is doing 25 km/h in your face, it seems longer. By the late afternoon the wind had died down to about 10 km/h with the occasional gusts just to remind you that it was doing you a favour by being so mellow. I have had trouble with this run each time I have taken it. The first time while heading east I was so bagged from the 234 km effort from the day before I felt slightly depressed. On the return trip the wind was so nasty I had to stop just to get away from the wind blasting me. And today, although not a nasty wind, it was blowing in my face. There is no place to eat between Valley View and Grande Prairie. I stopped and had an ice cream cone in Crooked Creek. The young attendant in ice cream shack came out and joined me. He asked lots of questions about my trip and thought he should do something similar. We found that we have common love: Powder King. It is a small world. I passed a large mower on the side of the road. It was kicking up a massive dust storm. Yuck! The operator must have seen me coming as he stopped until I passed. I was very grateful, as I did not feel like eating a couple pounds of road dust. Remember the hill that was missing yesterday? I found it. I was convinced it was between Fox Creek and Valley View but apparently it was between Valley View and Grande Prairie. Last year it was a nasty scorcher when I was travelling from Valley View to Grande Prairie and I had to stop and rest on the hill. There was no way I was willing to let a hill make me rest today. The hill, I suspect because it was not too hot out, was not such a big deal. It was like the East Pine hill only bigger and with better pavement. I got stubborn and refused to use the granny (lowest gear). The trucks crawled past me and I stood up on three different times and tried cranking it. I never was able to keep up with any of the trucks but I gave it a noble effort. Several cars honked in support.  I took it too easy today and did not make Grande Prairie in time to go to Source for Sports to get some new tubes. I was riding without any spares. I had two tubes with some life left in them but I could not find the holes in them. Let's hope this does not cause me trouble tomorrow.  Today was another awesome day. I felt good all day and felt that I was not in any hurry or under any pressure. I used to think the best thing to do was rush and then you get to rest in a motel room. Now, I prefer to use all the available time during the day. I find it quite easy to find a rest stop. I just sit in the ditch and watch life go by. If you can find shade it is totally bonus. Shade that is not man made is pretty rare in the Prairie Provinces but the occasional tree offers some relief.
"
93,"The road had some serious problems. From Grande Prairie to Hythe it was Good 50% and Excellent 50%. From Hythe to the BC border it varied from Poor 50% to Very Poor 25% and Hell 25%. I was trying to take advantage of a long gentle downgrade and let my speed build up. The constant smashing of my skinny tires into the massive, sharp-edged cracks in the pavement was starting to me nervous. I kept thinking, 'How much abuse can my tired front tire take?' The answer was to come fairly soon. I stopped at Demmit Park for a break. I've stopped there each time that I biked this route. It started to spit so I parked Susie in a shelter that once held a stove for cooking. It was very cold all day. When I stopped for the evening. The Weather Channel claimed it was 16 C, I would have guessed 10 C. I passed into BC and have to say I filled with mixed feelings. One, I had made it! Two, I had made it meaning the trip was practically over.  My question of how long can my front tire take this kind of abuse was answered within a km or two of entering BC. The front end felt all squirrelly and when I checked, sure enough it was half flat. I took out the tube and was able to find the hole. I was convinced it was a snakebite pinch flat that should have the 2 marks like a set of fangs had taken a bite. I could only find 1 hole. I put everything back together but did not feel very confident about the tube holding. Within 15 minutes, I was taking out the tube again trying to find the hole. Again, I could not find the hole so I did the only thing I could think of at the time. I massaged the patch on the tube to see if I could get a better seal. I rechecked inside the tire for an offending object that had pierced its way through the tube. After a few minutes, I found that there was something sticking through the tire but could only be felt from the outside. No idea what the object it was but I pulled it out and carried on and the tube got me into Dawson Creek. Although I had to fix the tube twice and in the rain, it did not seem like a big deal. After getting on my way once again, I saw one of my favorite sights. A long easy downgrade designed to make my life easier. I smiled and gave the brakes a little squeeze in anticipation of having to put them on a bit to stop from going into hyper speed. My smile vanished instantly. The front brake was worthless and the back brake on a bike is basically worthless at the best of times. Fortunately, I was not going very fast so the back brake and my foot dragging brought the bike to a stop. The cable had slipped out of its housing. If I had not noticed the problem with the brake when I did, the prognosis could have been rather grim. I made it into Dawson and headed straight for Timmy's. It had basically quit raining and I was only a couple of kms away from where I was going to stay. Timmy's was good as usual. I ran into a teacher at Timmy's and she was very impressed with my achievement. I had supper at the Lodge café. I had my traditional steak for supper and think it may have been one of the best I have had on the entire trip. I have made it my mission to do my level best to help the Alberta's ranchers until the Americans come to their senses and open up the border. A burger for lunch and a steak for supper had become my usual fare. If every Canadian followed suit we would not have to worry about the Americans opening the border to our farmers.  I stopped at the magazine store in Dawson Creek. They have tons of magazines. Unfortunately, biking is rather low on their list. I could only find 1 magazine on street riding. Right now I am so stuffed the only thing left to do is have a rest and read my magazine. Tomorrow, I plan on sleeping in - big time!!   "
94,"By 10:30 I was on my way. The first bit to Arras was rather sweet. The road is not really brand new but it is in pretty good shape. After Arras I hit the construction zone. It is 65 km of no shoulder. I don't mean a small shoulder, I mean no shoulder. It was even worse than Manitoba as you could not, without a mountain bike, ride on the unpaved shoulder. It had been graded and had big chunks of rock hard mud and boulders making travel impossible. The traffic was blocked behind me and when the dam burst and all the traffic came through, I had to pull over to let them by if there was any traffic approaching me. There were a ton of double dump trucks. They passed in me in a near constant stream. However, I was so happy when I saw what they were doing I made a point of thanking the flag people for the excellent job they were doing. I suspect they don't get a lot of feedback on how they are improving society and they looked at me rather strangely. One young man and I got into quite a conversation on how important good roads were to safety. I now have three local rides: a 200 km route with a fairly gentle terrain; a 200 km route with a nasty terrain; and a 320 km route that is so very nasty people write stories about it. Truly, I am blessed. Well, blessed or not, that last tube I put back in for the third time was not willing to let me make it home. At the turnoff to Little Prairie School, (about 2 km from home) the front tire communicates that it is short of air and not willing to travel in a straight line. I could have just pumped it up and made it home. However, I wanted to go to the pub and have supper. There is no way I wanted to come out of the pub to a flat so I took off my front wheel and removed the tire. I started looking for my new tube when a friend of mine showed up on her T2000 Cannondale. I was too spaced out to locate the tube I had stored just 8 hours previously so she lent me one of her tubes. After a steak and just two beers I was off to my house. Soon I was asleep and slept to about 6:15 when I got up to work on this journal!   "
95,"THE WHY? for France is pretty obvious really; get some early summer warm weather, cycle on lots of quiet roads through varied scenery; sit outside cafes having a nice coffee; eat some good food and generally have a great time - but not too great a time of course as I will be be wifeless. The other WHY for me is that for the past 12 years or so as I have been cycling around France, both with and without Jo I have been collecting BPF stamps. THE WHAT is: what the heck are BPF stamps? Well they are run by the French Cycle Tourist Organisation (FFCT) and stand for Brevet des Provinces Francaises; you have to be a member to take part. France is divided into 90 departments each of which has 6 designated places where you get a stamp on a card to verify that you have cycled there. There are 534 places throughout France, not 540 as you would think because 3 Paris departments are amalgamated into 1. These stamps are generally of some of the most picturesque places within a department and include: villages of specific historical interest; some of the most beautiful French villages; viewpoints e.g the top of cols; abbey's, chateaux etc etc. You can get a stamp from just about any establishment e.g cafes, shops, tourist offices etc. Have a look below...............      In conjunction with the BPF's there are also BCN (Brevet de Cyclotourisme National) of which there are 90(one stamp for each department). Before this trip I have got 53 BPF stamps still to get and 1 BCN stamp (but I won't get this last one on this trip). They are a great way of stringing a tour together. THE WHERE?  - well I have about 18 stamps to get which are scattered across various departments in the South West region of France; so that's where I am off to.     I am using the very excellent UK cyclists coach service to get me down there and then back. It's a superb hassle free way for us to get to France; they just load your bike onto a covered trailer (a huge thing); you sit down on the coach recliner seats for the duration (up to 24 hours depending on where you are going to) and then ride off into the sunset. You have the option of staying as long as you like over there; get a one way trip only and even get picked up at a different point to your drop off.
"
96,"The thing to understand here is that our formative years were in the 1960's which certainly was the best decade for music (don't argue about this as I won't listen to you) and arguably the best decade for being young. We were all full of enthusiasm for the future; we could clearly see that our generation was going to change the world for the better and that a utopian society wasn't too far away - peace on earth, goodwill to all men etc etc. But, alas, over 35 years on things have not turned out as we wanted them to and arguably we are in no better a situation now and perhaps a worse one in a lot of repects. So as we enter our 'troisieme age' (as the French say) we are having a right old moan about each and everything that gets up our noses about today's society. We have every right to!! The important thing to bear in mind from a reader's point of view is that we bear no malice or personal grudges against individuals or sections of society and are actually completely harmless. All we ask is that you allow us the chance to get things off our chest. So as I wind my way around France I may from time to time, though not necessarily every day, put pen to paper and have a right old moan about something that occurred on that day. I love France and the French (even with all their faults) but nevertheless get ready for some hometruths!! - I demand that right as a 'grumpy old man'    "

98,"   Potted history of La Rochelle............. A fishing village founded in the 10thC, a major port by the 12thC, granted a town charter in 1199. It's wealth and power based on wine and salt trade. Capital of French Protestism. In 1628, decimated by Louis XIII - lost it's town privileges and had it's remparts destroyed. By 18thC Canadian furs and Caribean sugar restored it's fortunes and also by this time it was an artistic and intellectual centre. Dormant again after the French revolution but by 20thC it's deepwater port and a canal connecting it to surrounding agricultural land   resurrected it once again and now with it's major yatching marina(over 3,000 boats),nearby beaches and road access to the Il de Re it is a major tourist area...........so now you know.    I had a wander around the the harbour area and the impressive towers at the harbour entrance....    Before heading off on the cycle lanes and paths that took me to, and then over, the Pont de Re onto the island................an impressive bridge.     There were cycle lanes and paths galore on the island and even though they wandered around a bit I didn't mind that, the weather was lovely and warm and the scenery was pretty good as well and there was the occassional character to stop and talk to...........     I was at Ars-en-Re by mid-morning, got my stamp, had a wander around this very pretty little fishing village, before heading off back to the bridge down the other side of the island - on yet more cycle paths.       It was a public holiday today and the roads were getting extremely busy which made the cycle paths all the more enjoyable. This is a very busy holiday island in high summer - avoid it then! The bridge is a toll bridge (not for bikes) and there were huge tailbacks on the other side as I recrossed back into La Rochelle. I spent more time in La Rochelle as it is a delightful place before tiredness started to creep in and I headed to the railway station and train back down to Saintes. A nice municipal campsite on the outskirts of town was my bed for the night. They had some basic foodstuffs there so I managed to concoct a passable pasta meal (I haven't got my food stocking processes sorted out yet). Well, you know what the first few days of a cycle tour are like, it's different then being at home and it takes us 2-3days to get things organised properly, well it does for me anyway.   There was some thunder in the evening and it clouded over but luckily no rain. I was slowing falling asleep by 21:00hrs, but it was still light and with other campers still sat outside their tents and vans I was reluctant to zip the tent up and disappear for the night.............I lasted until 21:30hrs and slept for 9+hrs.
"
99,"   It was 35kms to Talmont by the very wide River Gironde, which looked more like the sea when I first saw it(it's a real wide one!); my first BPF stamp of the day here for the 12thC church and remparts. Talmont is a small touristy hamlet with artists houses, speciality shops and small restaurants - a pleasant spot by the river. Not the weather for doing too much hanging about however as there was the threat of rain (I got a few drops), so I carried on...into a headwind.      Blaye, my next BPF place was about 60+kms away and I had the wide River Gironde as company on my right hand side for all the way. The road was reasonably quiet, the hills were gentle and the weather started to improve gradually; things were looking good as I first passed through Cognac brandy country and then into the Bordeaux wine area and the road got flatter but all the way I had that troublesome headwind.    Don't know if it was yesterday's high mileage or lack of sleep before that, or was it the headwind but I was going through a dodgy patch - more likely I was not eating enough. I had only eaten a flan mid-morning and half a baguette with some chocolate spread for lunch; that's not enough for me.....I need loads, and I mean loads to keep me going. The trouble is when I am not with Jo I tend to keep riding and forget about eating enough... I got to Blaye about 14:00hrs and got my BPF stamp at the Tourist Office just as it was opening after lunch and then I sat down in some shade(it was hot now) and considered my options.... -Carry on and perhaps finish up wrecking myself, which would be fatal this early in the trip and I am ahead of schedule so there's no rush. -Stay here with an early stop and get some rest; Blaye looks a pleasant place with its 17thC Citadelle by the Gironde and anyway the weather was hot now and the next section was hillier and I was tired and...... is that enough excuses for stopping or do you want more? As long as I am in Toulouse by 3rd June for my coach back home then I am under no timetable and that's how cycle touring should be- so I am stopping..OK! There was a great little cheap campsite, a 200 metre walk from town, inside the impressive Citadelle so in I went and found myself a nice shady spot under a tree. Unfortunately I realised later that this was a Blossom tree and it was breezy and the blossom was ready to drop so the tent got covered and if I sat in the shade so did I.      Missing my wife... I am relaxing in some lovely warm weather with a bottle of wine reflecting on the day and looking forward to tomorrow and generally enjoying life but there's something missing...I have nobody to talk to, discuss matters or even argue over points. In short, I am missing my wife - but don't go telling her that or she will get all sentimental. It's fine when I am riding during the day as I can just crack on at my pace and do the miles but then at the end of the day it's a different matter. The evenings can be long without some company. But, hold on, things aren't that bad....Alan from Paris on a recumbent turns up and he speaks perfect English so we discuss his 2 month around France trip and then Malcolm from the English campervan opposite wanders over for a chat so in fact I am not missing my wife as much now.....but don't go telling her that either!      Hint of the day......... How to drink a whole bottle of wine without any effect on the next day's cycling: the secret is to start early and drink slowly: I started at 16:30hrs and it lasted me until 21:30hrs - a very pleasant evening was had.    "
100,"I stopped to check my map outside a small farmhouse and an elderly chap comes out to assist(he spoke reasonable english), he was able to help me and then told me to follow him into his garden, which I did. He then proceeded to fill a plastic bag with some long green beans(enough for a family of four!) and told me to cook them with some salt. He was off fishing on the Gironde in his boat for Sardines; the big ones, he said. So with about 2kgs more on my bike I carried on - well you can't really refuse can you? In the end I gave the beans to a French caravan couple on the campsite as they wouldn't even fit into my small pan. I ventured into and out of Libourne - a large town; mainly because it avoided me having to make a loop around it on minor roads. Now, minor roads are definitely the way to cycle in France but you have to be prepared for lots of stopping at road junctions to check your route. With villages and hamlets being quite close together at times sometimes only the next immediate one is signposted which is not necessarily the one you are aiming for. The best way, generally is to follow the road numbers e.g D114, but beware where you go from one department to another as these will suddenly change - it all goes towards making a cycle tour that bit more interesting, doesn't it? As it was, Libourne was a good place and it served two purposes for me: I got my morning coffee and then bought a sandwich, a tart and a cold drink for my lunch, before I headed out towards St Emilion.      It's all Bordeaux wine country around here and St Emilion is a major centre, surrounded by the top quality stuff - Premier Cru everywhere. St Emilion is also an old fortified town with some very impressive buildings, cobbled streets etc and it deserves it's BPF status. I would have liked to have wandered around it a bit but it was a holiday saturday and the place was crowded so I didn't stop long after getting my stamp at the Tourist Office. I suppose that's one of the prices to pay for a beautiful old place - best seen out of season and public holidays. The other downer of it being a popular tourist place was I needed some water and the only stuff I could get was a small bottle that cost me 2 Euros! you pay less than that for one twice the size in a supermarket.        After St Emilion I was heading due south for 60kms and with warm weather, a tailwind , gentle hills and pleasant scenery - life was good.At St Croix du Mont my next BPF place, the Boulangerie and Epicerie were both shut and there was nowhere else for a stamp. No problem; out comes the camera, bike against the town sign and picture taken - and that's enough evidence. The BPF stamp is for the panorama from the Chateau du Tastes in the village, which was good, but I forgot to take a picture so you will have to take my word for it. The final 20+K was a downhill swoop, across the Gironde, straight through Langdon and then minor roads through forests to Bazas, my finish and final BPF stamp of the day - 15-17thC town and 13-18thC cathedrale (a huge thing on the skyline). I broke rule 73 of the cycle touring bible here because as I entered the town I saw a sign for the campsite and went that way; unfortunately it was 3kms out of town and up a hill and a side road. When I got there I realised I had no food for tea and really didn't fancy going back into town. Luckily the camp office had some basic supplies so it was a big tin of saucisses and lentils with a tin of rice pudding to follow; simple to cook and filling - I ate the rice cold. Postscript:  On the final section today I passed a cycle route called the Roger Laperbie verte; it runs for 55kms east of Bordeaux to Sauveterre de Guyenne; it looks to be a great way of getting east from Bordeaux. There are an increasing number of these cycle routes being converted from old railway lines throughout France."
101,"So, naturally I woke up early and was off into town by 08:00hrs to get my brekky and do some shopping. I went into the cafe for my coffee and as normal I asked for 'une grande creme' and the lady behind bar asked me if I wanted it 'moyenne grande' or 'grande grande'; for a sleepy moment I was confused; I've never been asked that before, so seeing as it was obvious I needed waking up I went for the latter - and very good it was too; lots of coffee and a jug of hot milk to go with it. I spent a pleasant 40mins in there waiting for the shop opposite to open. This was the 'huit to huit' shop which on a sunday doesn't open until 'neuf' - why is that then???? Once open I got stocked up for lunch and tea. Cyclists touring advice for a sunday in France - get your food in the morning because as sure as eggs is eggs you will not find anywhere open later in the day and thats how it turned out today. After 3days I am finally getting organised! I was heading due south, with that favourable cool northerly wind behind me,into the forrested Landes region; lots of trees, scattered hamlets and not many cars - all very pleasant but more than a couple of days of this samey scenery and I would start to get bored. Also there were no facilities on route so I made my own rest stops up; mainly by checking my map at road junctions; sometimes when I didn't really need to.     At St Justin by a main road and a small bull ring (the second one I had seen today) there were some picnic tables and seeing as it was 12 o'clock I stopped for some lunch. I am out of the Cognac and Bordeaux country now; this the Armagnac area - a beautiful brandy drink. Not as well known as it's big brandy brother Cognac; Armagnac is considered a more sophisticated drink  - the difference between the two is in the distillation process. Have a look here if you want more info    More quiet roads after here, undulating now through Villeneuve-de-Marsan to Grenade-s-Ardour where I got my second coffee of the day. The River Ardour here, unlike previous rivers I had come across, was running heavy and was a mucky grey colour - think this is because it's source is in the snowy Pyrenees.I was getting tired later and at St Sever I did consider stopping for the day as there was a campsite here but Hagetmau, where I needed a BPF stamp, was only another 15kms away, so I carried on - it was only 15:00hrs as well. Things went a bit pear shaped from here on........ - I fancied a beer at Hagetmau but there wasn't one single bar open; there was nothing open!- I went to the campsite, but it doesn't open until 1st June!I was directed towards a 'chambres d'hote' but on the way saw a sign 'camping 5kms'- So I headed there (it was my route tomorrow as well). Once there however it looked closed and it was a dump of a place. There was a guy there in an old caravan and obviously the worse for drink. He confirmed the place was closed (permanently by the look of it) but said I could stop for the night at no charge.- It was just after I had put the tent up that I realised that I had not got my BPF stamp whilst in Hagetmau; I am going to have to go back in tomorrow!      However things improved after that. I had something for tea; the weather was warm and surprisingly there was hot water in the 'shower block' and the shower was excellent which purely on that criteria the 'campsite' gets high marks, especially as it was free! I spent the final hour swatting small flying things away from the tent door as I was getting the last sun rays and they wanted some of them as well - there's not enough room for the both of us matey's! - clear off!!   "
102,"   Lots of ups and downs today but nothing too severe - a good day's cycling. My next BPF stamp was at Morlanne and there were lots here: a Chateau(saw that); an Abbey(saw that); a fortified church(saw that); and a Roman Camp(never saw that and no idea where it was) - probably just a bunch of old stones. Surprisingly for a village with all of that there was nowhere to get a stamp on my card so out came the camera again.    I was on high ground around here and there were views of the distant snowy Pyrenees - just too far away to be photogenic.I was also in the old Bearn province now with signposts having the old Occitane language of the area on them as well as French; not so sure why this should be as far as I am aware it this old language is not spoken at all. I was also coming across the St Jacques Compostella pilgrimage route that goes into Spain; I came across a number of walkers at Arthez-de-Bearn where I rested briefly. Orthez in the valley was another town on the pilgrim route; I had a coffee here and also checked out the possibility of getting a train eastwards later on today as I needed to move about 150kms to another region. There was one at 17:58hrs from Puyoo, up the line, which I could reach easily after going on a loop to get my final 2 stamps for this region.    Sauveterre-de-Bearn, another pilgrim stopover place and also a BPF stamp place was reached after some hilly work in hot weather; I was moving over into another major valley - the Oloron. BPF for: Mediaeval town, 12thC church (a nice one), the remparts, the view, the old bridge and the fact it is on the Compostelle route. It was hot, hot now so I had a shady rest for a while knowing that the hills were behind me for the day; I had valley riding only now and a train journey and bags of time in hand.           With time in hand I sauntered down the valley onto Sorde l'Abbaye, my final BPF stamp for this area. The 12-13thC abbey was closed off so I couldn't look around that but the bar was open so I could go in that - so I did. I had a beer knowing that I only had flat roads now to get to Puyoo. I also laid my tent out to dry as it was still soaked with the overnight dew when I packed it up this morning. Relaxed in my seat with beer in hand I spotted a cycle tourist going the other way, head bent over his bars, leaning into the headwind he was getting. Don't you just hate having to do that; at least the breeze will be keeping him cool.     I had time in hand at Puyoo so I got myself a pastry from the Boulangerie and went into the station cafe and had a couple more beers and watched the end of a stage in the Tour of Italy on TV whilst waiting for the train. By 19:20hrs I was getting off the train at Tarbes with just one problem - where do I stay? I had no details of any campsite here and the Tourist Office was shut; so rarther than head off at this time looking for a campsite I went straight to the first cheap hotel I could find, which was 200 metres away, and got myself settled in there. A good day and I have managed to get myself someway towards my next area.
"
103,"   I was up and down all day today; either going slowly uphill in a low gear or freewheeling downhill in any gear. I was riding against the grain of the land going west to east as all the valleys hereabouts run north to south; bad planning or what! I was actually heading from the major valley of the Ardour to the major valley of the Garonne but on the way I was dropping into and climbing out of about 14 other valleys of various shapes and sizes. There was the Alaric, the Esteous, the Arros, the Boues, the Lizon, the Baisse Darre, the Baisse Devant, the Gers, the Gimone, the Gesse, the Bernesse, the Saue, the Nere and the Louge - at least the hills were good gradients, so no steepness to tire the legs, just the endless repetition, so after nearly 100kms of this I had had about enough.      The scenery wasn't particularly spectacular, just rolling hills of woodland and farmland; the roads were quiet for the first 40kms but then got busier, which also coincided with the roads getting slightly steeper. That's the big problem with progress in road improvements; all the long winding narrow roads with easy gradients tend to get straightened out somewhat, with the result that the gradients get steeper - so that all the cars can get there faster. The only plus for cyclists is that the road surfaces tend to be smoother, which was the case today.The secret in France if you have to cycle a busy road is to try and do it over the 2hr lunch period when most of the drivers are sat in cafes/restaurants; but beware when they venture out, full of beer and wine.       At Boussens near the River Garonne I found a nice little municipal campsite and called it a day; it was only when I had put the tent up that I noticed the noise of the nearby motorway and then the occassional train going past. Sod it! - I'm not moving on now. Luckily I had some food with me as there was no shop in the village; I could get my hair cut, get a drink at the bar(no food) or get a dodgy looking pizza slice or an old croissant at the just about closed down Boulangerie. GRUMP of the DAY: Well I am 6 days into this trip and it's about time I had a grump; and the subject is The French and their dogs! The Brits are quite a dog and pet loving nation but really we have nothing on the French as regards dogs. I can handle the fact that some French woman want to carry those little dogs they have, at least they can't get at your ankles whilst they are held up. I can just about control myself when the French bring dogs into restaurants; I gape in amazement when they sit them on their lap and feed them stuff from their plate (yes, I have seen that happen and on more than one occassion). But, what I can't handle is the quiet of the countryside being destructed by yapping dogs. The worse time is when they jump up from behind the fence when you are totally absorbed in the tranquility of the moment and they scare the absolute #### out of you. It's enough to give you a heart attack and at my age that could be fatal! The other thing is it is never just one dog; one dog starts off which triggers another dog further down the road and then another one and another one and so on....Sometimes it can go for  miles! I wouldn't mind that much but the French say they have them as guard dogs; fine, except looking at the stste of some of those farmhouses there can't be anything in them worth pinching! I could go on and on about this but I am biding my time until I get re-incarnated as French President when my first act will be to introduce compulsory vocal cord cutting on all French dogs!!!
"
104,"I left before 08:00hrs; nobody turned up to collect campsite fees; there was nobody about last night either - so I started the day off in credit. I decided to follow the Garonne valley northwards for a while as a direct line across country would be more of that valley over to next valley riding like I had yesterday and my legs said they wanted breaking easily today - so I obeyed them. I had my brekky in Cazannes after 10kms just as the place was starting to come to life.         There was a PMU bar here and as you are normally guaranteed a good coffee in them in I went. PMU bars (a national franchise chain) are in reality lottery/horse racing betting places so they always attract a good crowd of interesting and varied people (the French love their betting). There was quite a crowd in this morning and it was only 08.15hrs; there were 3 old guys in particular who were well into the red wine (how can they drink wine as this early hour??) and they were getting noisier and noisier; one of them had a voice that was at least 5 decibels higher than anybody else - I bet you could hear him half way down the street. I was in there more than half an hour just enjoying the atmosphere  - what a laugh. 25kms further up the valley I turned right and headed across the hills to Cintegabelle for my BPF stamp; I had picked a road marked yellow on the map which should mean that it would be fairly quiet; unfortunately it was something of a cross country route between major roads for lorries but at least the surface was good; gradients ok and there was something of a hard shoulder to ride on at times.  At Cintegabelle I had  my elevenses coffee  - not a PMU bar; my ears needed a rest!    I am in the Haute-Garonne department around here; lots of rolling low level hills (up to 300 metres), gentle gradients (mostly), some long distance views, scattered farmhouses, house, hamlets and villages. A quiet area generally, a lovely cycling area. But note: it can get very hot down here, especially in high summer (avoid it then); the treelined roads provide lots of shade and they were in use today  as the weather hotted up.          Past Lac d'Estrade and down to the main valley and across the Canal du Midi; this valley is about the only east-west-east crossing hereabouts. The roads were a lot gentler after here, which was good news, as the weather was definitely on heat now.     I got to Revel about 15:00hrs and went to the Tourist Office to check on campsites - two bits of news: the bad news was that the local municipal campsite doesn't open until 15th June; the good news was that there were 2 campsites at St Ferreol, 3kms away and there was a supermarket on that route - great; get something for tea. This bit of good news turned a little sour because as soon as I left the supermarket the road just went up and up for the 2-3kms        I had one of my easiest and favourite meals for tea; pork chop and haricots vert.At the supermarket I picked the biggest chop I thought would fit into my small frying pan (it was a tight squeeze but it just fitted). Recipe: heat beans up and put to one side; seal chop on both sides in hot pan(no need for oil or butter); cook on a lower heat for 4-5 mins each side then add beans to pan and eat.........scrumy! You could go all gourmet and add sauces etc but that's either extra weight to carry or extra cash to buy. I'm on a budget!
"
105,"I left about 08:00hrs and had a cold descent back down into Revel and then 15kms to Puylaurens, my first BPF stamp of the day; an old village perched on a hill with a chateau, some ruins, old market halls, narrow streets and a panoramic view. I had my coffee/breakfast here, sat inside a cafe; there was no panoramic view to be had anywhere and it wasn't warm enough yet to sit outside. For the next 45kms I took to minor quiet roads with some gentle climbing over small ridges; there was sufficent to see that on a brighter day there would be some good views hereabouts. I kept moving as I had a master plan today to have a sit down lunch at Gaillac and the plan worked out as I arrived just before noon, just as the restaurants were ready to receive. I found a restaurant in the main square with tables outside in the sunshine and sat myself down; I went for the 10E set menu; tomato/tuna/mayo entree; steak with haricot verts and saute potatoes; creme brulee; quarter bottle of wine and a coffee to finish - excellent!  - a lovely hour in the sunshine. Refreshed and ready to move on............      One of the reasons for having a restaurant lunch was to cut down on evening cooking. I had brought a lightweight stove with me that uses screw on gas  cartridges; I was running short of gas and was having considerable trouble getting a replacement. France does not seem to stock them! Next time I bring my Trangia, even though it is slightly heavier, as there is no trouble at all getting meths for it. Another 25+kms on more gentle undulating roads through countryside of vine fields, farms, scattered hamlets, not jaw dropping beautiful just pretty and pleasant enough and with very little traffic it was all very enjoyable. What did drop the jaw was the first of Cordes, sat atop the highest hill around. Cordes is actually know as Cordes-s-Ciel - 'the town in the sky'.       Historically it's a 13thC fortified town; visually it's lots of mediaeval stone buildings aside narrow cobbled streets, some lovely stone archways and just a lot of interest. There was a bunch of cycles parked at the bottom of the town with 'Butterfield & Robinson' (an upmarket travel company) handlebar bags attached to most of them. Rather than leave my bike at the bottom I rode around the outskirts on a non-cobbled road to the back of town where there was less walking to do to get into the upper part. I found the cycle owners; they were  were a group of Americans having a guided tour of the town; I gave them a wave and then got my BPF stamp at the Tourist Office. Well, you didn't expect a place like this not to be a BPF place did you?           I tried to ride back down the cobbles, or rarther bumped my way down, until one particular section got too steep and bumpy and I was having to grip my brakes that hard I was getting pains in my hands - so I got off and walked!! - and that was difficult enough.    At the Tourist Office I picked up some info on 2 nearby campsites - no problems then?  - wrong! First of all I went 3kms in one direction only to find out that the campsite did not open for another four days. So I retraced my route (back up the hill) back through the lower town (thankfully not back up to the cobbled part) and then 2kms the other way. The notice at this campsite entrance said 'ouvert' - good then - wrong! There was nobody about and nobody else on the campsite - it was the Marie Celeste; there was a mass of tools in the sanitary block amongst all the new facilities currently being installed. I checked the water - nothing on. What now, then. Well back at the road junction there was a sign 'Camp Redon 5kms' roughly in the direction I wanted for tomorrow. Do I chance it?  - no choice - go for it! Up a long hill (naturally enough); past a French woman cycle tourist pushing one very heavily laden bike - 'bonne courage, madam' I said as I went past. She managed a lovely smile and said a 'merci, bonne route a vous' which was all the more commendable as she was suffering somewhat. Good on yer, madam! Well Camp Redon was open and a nice place, run by a Dutch couple and naturally with a lot of Dutch on site. I had some nice evening sunshine to end the day and was blissfully unaware at this stage what troubles were in store overnight.............   "
106,"To add to my morning woes the mist was well down and it was very cool as well: I was dressed in arm & leg warmers as well a jacket for the first 2hrs or so. I was feeling lethargic as well for a while with heavy legs, probably due to lack of sleep due to Charlie boy's antics. There was no immediate cafe so my breakfast was a banana and 2 fruit squares held over from yesterday.     I was planning on my coffee breakfast being at Pampelonne, my BPF stamp place after a hour's riding but there was no cafe here; only a Boulangerie open where I got 2 'pain aux raisins' and stuffed them inside me. The BPF was for the Viaduc de Tanus (which was 4kms away) and the Barrage du Viar(which was down a big hill); neither of them on my intended route from here so neither of them got a visit from me - I just didn't have the energy either today.     However the day started to get better on all fronts from here; the sun started to break through the clouds; it warmed up and 8kms further on at Mirandol-Bougnounac there was a cafe open - hurrah. It was well worth the wait as I got a large cup 3/4 full of coffee and a jug full of hot milk; and all for 2E20. I spent a heavenly 20mins slowly drinking it all and then walked out into warm sunshine. All of a sudden my mood lifted; my legs felt better and off I zipped.  Strange how little things like the sun coming out and a good dose of caffiene can improve your cycling outlook. I was riding at the 350-400 metres height around here; very picturesque with some lovely long distance views; then I had a long descent down to the River Viaur; leaving the Tarn department and moving across to the Aveyron where I had one stamp to get at Najac.          To get there meant a 3km climb from the river and then I dropped again before climbing again to get up to the 400 metre level before a final descent down to Najac. Hard work but well worth it for the views and especially the view of the village of Najac with its majestic Chateau fort. A beautiful place as you can see from the photos.       I had a good wander around and seeing as it was lunchtime I decided on a sit down meal and got myself a table with a view of the Chateau and had the 'plat du jour' - a lovely chicken pasta with a coffee to round it off. I was feeling even better now and probaly more so because I was getting a rest shortly as I   intended a catch a train northwards for about 150kms to move on to another department.      The train station was right down in the valley bottom so I had a lovely freewheel.The next train to Brive, my destination was at 14:00hrs, an hour away so I had a bit of a siesta in the shade until then. No problems with the bike - just wheel it on. I had an hour's wait at Figeac for a connection (again, no bike problems) before I arrived at Brive (a major city of this region) just after 17:00hrs.       Brive was busy; it was the 'rush hour'. I spotted a campsite sign and followed them; taking me around town before depositing me at a closed campsite. What now? Head out on my intended route to Donzenac(about 12kms away)that's what; the bad side of that was I had one huge long hill to climb to get out of Brive and I had to contend with the busy traffic for a while as well. The rewards of the hard work was a long descent down to the bottom of the hill that lead up to Donzenac. The good news here was that the campsite was at the bottom of the hill and it was a good campsite too. The bad news was I only had half a baguette (which I bought in Brive) and a tin of sardines for tea - I wish I  had killed Charlie now. GRUMP of the DAY: About time I had another one of these and this time it is the French and their smoking habits. Generally I have no problems with people smoking; that's their decision in a free, democratic society.However how they can carry on smoking with all the evidence stacked up against the practice is something I'll never fathom out. But, what really brasses me off and I found this more prevalent in France than anyway else is the amount of smoking that goes on in restaurants -it should be banned. How can the French smokers, of all people, who are supposed to have some of the world's best food actually taste the stuff they are eating when they smoke more or less continously through their courses. Just about everytime between courses they light up. That's bad enough but what really gets up my nose(literally) is that us non-smokers have to suffer all of that smoke at the same time, ruining our tase buds and our enjoyment of our meal. When I am reincarnated as French President my second act will be to ban smoking in all restaurants! - send them outside to smoke!
"
107,"   I was heading into Vezere valley after Donzenac but that didn't mean flat valley; it was basically a succession of ups and downs, all quite gentle however and relatively traffic free and with some good views as well. It was about 18kms to Voutezac for my BPF stamp which I got at the Post Office. The stamp is for the Vezere valley itself and also the nearby Gorges du Saillant, which you really have to walk to for the best views. There was a village wedding going on so I hung around for 10mins or so just observing; just about all the village had come out to watch.          From Voutezac another 16kms or so of undulations brought me to another mediaeval village; Vigeois this time. On the way there was an increased amount of traffic coming the other way and also increasing numbers of people by the roadside as well as various food and drink tents setup. I found out later that there was a 3day motor rally going on in the area - it's a holiday weekend (Pentecost). I had another coffee at Vigeois, mainly because it was such a pleasant little place I fancied a stop and a sit in the sunshine. Another 10kms took me to the larger town of Uzerche; another mediaeval type place - some lovely old stone buildings and a chateau. This is a lovely area around here - pretty countryside and some equally pretty villages.     Uzerche sits in a valley bottom so after buying something for lunch I had quite a climb out; lunchtime came just I came across a closed cafe/restaurant which fortunately had a table and chairs in the shade outside which I took advantage of - nice to have a civilised sit down picnic rather than a patch of grass.    I got to Treignac by 14:00hrs where there were banners everywhere about the recent canoeing championships that had just finished. There were cars going here,there and everywhere with canoes on the top - there were also various shouts coming up from the river as people negotiated their way down.There was a followup 3 day canoeing festival going on this weekend. I had a bit of decision to make here because:- I was undecided about heading further north as this could pose problems for getting back to Toulouse. The further north I go the harder it will be for returning.- There would be limited campsites further north as this is a less touristy region and also they may not be open yet this early in the season.I have no campsite info with me for the next department further north.- My next BPF stamp northwards is 80ms away; too far for today. My decision was that I pack in here as there is a campsite 4kms away and the Tourist Office says it is a 4star one so it is likely have a washing machine so I can get my washing up to date and get it dry in this warm weather. There is also a supermarket in town. Right; sorted off we go then. Bye the way, Treignac sits at 482 metres and the BPF stamp is for the Massif des Monedieres(north of here); the Virolle waterfall(no idea where that is) and the rock cliffs in Treignac itself. Treignac is a very pleasant spot. I found out where all the canoeists were staying  - at the campsite! I was about the only one without a canoe and quickly became the centre of attention. 4 star the campsite may be but the washing machine was out of action so I tired out my arms (so now they are as tired as my legs) hand washing my clothes. I was still having to save gas so instead of a cooked meal I ate the rest of my bread with a tin of sardines and followed that up with 2 tins of rice pudding and a banana - that did the trick.  I have more complaints about the campsite - the showers weren't hot; the grass was uncut and generally the whole place was not in good shape and worse was to come..........................."
108,"So with weary eyes I awoke at 07:00hrs to the sound of rain on the tent, which thankfully was the only noise now, so I had a lie in and packed up and left about 09:00hrs when the rain stopped briefly. This wasn't promising to be a good day so first off I headed into town for my coffee brekky and a couple of pastries - feeling better already. I eventually left town about 10:00hrs - in the rain.     I decided to take a minor road rather than the main one on the basis that it would be quieter and probably with easier gradients. Well as I found out when I rejoined the main road later on it wasn't really any quieter and it definitely wasn't easier. The main road took the gradual rising route over the hills whereas the minor road went first of all to the head of the valley before climbing steeply out - it was hard and not enjoyable in this weather. I was up around the 800 meter level now and I was feeling quite cool and damp; my toes were feeling it the worse as I was riding in Shimano sandals, which aren't really meant for this type of weather. I had meant to bring my Goretex socks with me for just this sort of occassion but I couldn't find them so had to suffer (the postscript to this is I found my socks at the bottom of my panniers when unpacking back home!). I diverted 3kms to go over the Col des Geants at 824 meters (I collect cols so even this weather wasn't going to deter me) before heading generally downwards to Egletons. There were 2 racing cyclists out training  but they had this weather sussed out as they had a following car with them so if they got fed up with the weather they could retreat to a warmer environment. I was OK whilst pedalling but once the long descent began I had to resort to putting both my jackets on to keep warm as I was expanding no energy for the final few kms into Egletons where it was cold and damp and the thermometer by the Pharmacy said 13'C only.        I bought something for lunch; I fancied a restaurant meal but the 3 places I saw all had 'complet' signs outside of them - being the Pentecostal weekend everybody was eating out today. I bought something at the Boulangerie and cracked on in order to keep warm, taking the N road as I couldn't be bothered chasing minor roads in this weather and anyway with it being lunchtime the road would not be too busy and being a sunday there would be no lorries out there and also the nearby motorway has taken a lot of traffic off the N road. The road was quiet and later on a bus shelter appeared so I had a dry lunch stop before I carried on to Meymac where a hot coffee warmed me up and the rain stopped as well. This was my final BPF stamp of the trip - for the nearby Plateau de Milevaches and Meymac's 12thC church and 15thC tower. I had made a decision not to continue further north from here mainly now because of the weather - northwards I would be heading up to even higher ground and potentially worse weather - definitely colder weather!.     Another 25kms from Meymac took me to Neuvic by 16:00hrs; there were a good few French cycle tourists out on this section; one group with a car behind them with flashing lights. Neuvic was a ghost town - everywhere was shut for the day so it was a good job I had some food stocks with me. There was a quiet campsite 2kms away by the lake and as soon as I had the tent up I dived into the sleeping bag to get warm, just as the rain started again..and then stopped..and then started again... A hot shower, which I spent ages under, further helped to warm me up and a cooked meal (sod the gas situation) helped even further.    "
109,"- I left my towel out overnight (again) and it rained so now it's sopping wet.- I had some bouts of heavy rain overnight and it was cold at times; I never really warmed up after that all day.- My tent is wet through, just about all of it; I had to use sheets of L'Equipe sportspaper as floor covering in the evening to keep my sleeping mat dry.- It was another Fete's day today so there was just about nothing open all day and I was short of food.- Because of the recent wet weather I have not been able to get any clothes washed and dried; I'm starting to feel unclean.- I lost my second (spare) pair of reading glasses; can't read my map properly - that makes for some interesting route finding.- I got hunger knock late on and just made it to the campsite without collapsing; stuffed my emergency rations (a dehydrated meal) inside me at 16:30hrs to recover.  I left Neuvic just after 08:00hrs and luckily found an open Boulangerie in town (the only place open apart from the newsagents)which also had a small cafe section so I was able to get a coffee and a couple of pastries for breakfast and some bread and fruit for lunch. I was in the high Dordogne valley and had some lovely views as I made my way down the valley; the downside was the roads didn't follow the valley all the way so I had quite a bit of climbing and descending to do on my way to Argentan where there as one cafe open; so in I went for a warm up coffee.              I had a bit of a lazy touring day today, stopping to admire the views, take some pictures and generally take it easy. Found myself a good campsite at Beaulieu which also had some good hot showers so I spent some time in there and then a rest before thankfully finding a cafe/restaurant in town in the evening so I went for quantity and had a large pizza - enough for two! Feeling better now."
110,"My second choice was to train it to Figeac and then ride from there but at St Martel(after 30kms), the first railway station I came across, the guy there said there were no trains until late afternoon that could take bikes. So I went to 3rd choice which was to ride down the Dordogne valley to Souillac and get a train from there. Before all of that I had a lazy start to the day, going into town for my standard coffee/pastry breakfast which was a longer one this morning as I was waiting for the Opticans opposite the bar to open at 09:30hrs - I needed to get another pair of reading glasses if I was keep on the correct roads today; trying to read a map at arms length without any glasses just wasn't possible! At just 09:30hrs the guy opened the doors and I was straight in there - much to his surprise. Don't think he normally gets customers this early. For 13euros I got my glasses and was off down the road.         At Carennac, a very pretty village, I chatted to an English foursome who were holidaying in the area and were out on their bikes for a short ride in the rain - just like being at home was their comment. And then 200metres further down the road I bumped into a lone American who was touring over here for a fortnight on his Bike Friday; we had a chat about all things France before he went to look at the chateau and I carried down the valley.     The Dordogne valley is world famous and rightly so as it is a very beautiful valley and even in this sort of weather there were some lovely old buildings and villages with their distinctive architecture either side of the wide river backed up by some impressive limestone escarpments - a gorgeous ride. The narrow roads were very quiet but they won't be like this in the hot summer months of July & August (best avoided then) - lots of swimming options in the river but wild horses wouldn't drag me in there today. I had my picnic lunch in the dry in the small hamlet of Creyssac before arriving in the wet of Souillac by early afternoon.        I went straight to the station to check on times as there seemed little point in hanging about here in this weather. The plan now was to train it to Cahors (about 80kms away) and consider my options from there tomorrow; there was a train in an hour so I went into the nearby cafe for another coffee - and just about the worst one on this trip.  In Cahors the rain came on again, heavy this time. Camping just didn't feel like the right option now, what with my wet tent and some damp clothes, so I went to the Tourist Office and got a hotel list. I checked out the cheapest options (one was closed and one didn't open until 18:00hrs) so I finished up at the hotel directly opposite the railway station which in hindsight is perhaps where I should have gone in the first place. I hung my tent up in the shower cubicle after my shower (it was dry in the morning) and after a good rest I treated myself to a meal in the hotel restaurant in the evening, with some wine - life's a lot better now.
"
111,"       The train was delayed by 15mins as we had something of an 'incident' as the police would say. We had an over fussy train guard running up and down the train carriages talking loudly away to everybody (never understood fully what he was saying); then we had the station master appearing; then 3 gendarmes appeared with their truncheons at the ready; then they were knocking on the toilet door; then a young lad appeared from out of the toilet compartment; then they all had a chat; then the guard came back down the train chattering away again; then the gendarmes and the station master went away and the train departed. No idea what happened to the young lad as he wasn't taken away or even the slightest idea what the whole fuss was about   - I'm still confused!   I had my morning coffee in Montauban station before battling with the traffic to get away from this large town; I was seeking out the minor roads to take me down to Toulouse but had 10kms of main road first to get me to Montech where I arrived at noon and was just about to go into the Boulangerie for some bread when I spotted a cafe/restaurant and felt that was a much better option; I am in total wind down mode now so a leisurely lunch seems ideal. I just went for a pizza rarther than a three course meal and also had yet another coffee(a small one this time.       I was following minor roads to the outskirts of Toulouse which anywhere else would be quiet; these started off relatively quiet but they got busier and busier the closer I got to Toulouse. I had one bit of mis-navigation near the end which resulted in me having to dice with certain death as I tried to get across a filter lane that was taking traffic off the motorway onto my road; I was stood on the chevrons with traffic streaming past me on both sides. One car with a group of young lads in thought my situation was really hilarious - they slowed down enough to blast away on their horn and have a real good laugh at me - it took about 5mins (it was just one continuous stream of traffic) before one kind guy slowed down enough to let me get across and I was away.       I found the spot where the coach will be picking me up tomorrow and then found a campsite about 1km away. This was Camping au Fort Knox; intercom to speak to reception, massive sliding metal gates that they opened if they liked the look of your face. Once in, it was a reasonable place even though there were a lot of permanent residents there; it had a bar so a couple of beers went down well. So now I am sat in warm sunshine but no longer the quiet and solitude of the countryside; instead I can hearing barking dogs, planes taking off, motorway noise, and the wind whistling through trees. I'll try and put the first 3 out of my mind and listen to the last one only. I had no food left and there were no shops nearby so I went on an evening march to try and find a restuarant; 30mins on I came across the Hotel Etats-Unis and a pizzeria attached to it. I seemed to be the only non-resident eating there but had a very pleasant hour plus eating the good food and people watching. This was the archetypal business man's hotel - there were 18 tables occupied and 15 of them had a single person only with one woman out of the 15 - 50% of them brought a book or a paper with them to read. All levels of dress up to the smartly dressed 30 something who proceeded to talk into his mobile all the way through ordering and then whilst eating his meal; that requires quite a skill to do successfully. There was the guy who chuckled away to himself most of the time; the few guys who came in ordered and ate one course and then quickly departed.There were the smokers again who got through about 3 cigs each through their courses;luckily not near me. I was reluctant to leave as I was enjoying myself so much; think I might take up people watching a lot more in future. The question for today is: why is a hotel on the outskirts of a large French city called the Hotel United States?
"
112,"I finished up with a new of cycling bib shorts, great value at 50% reduction; the blue pair I had with me definitely needed throwing away as I could sense that the derriere of them was getting very thin. I would certainly have had some comments from Jo if she had been riding behind me. I also bought a pair of sunglass at 30% reduction - because I fancied them. And seeing as I was here I bought a new tyre as a present for Jo - so much better and more functional than a bottle of perfume don't you think and above all else it matches a tyre she has at home so now she has a matching pair -so very chic and in purple as well -her favourite colour.  And, then it was lunchtime so I diverted across the road to the Casino Supermarket and their excellent value restaurant, along with crowds of other people as well. After that it was a nice leisurely ride back down the canal and a bit of a siesta on a bench in the shade by the canal, watching the world go by. I went to the pick-up point a good hour before and already there was 1 couple and a single guy there; we had a good chat about our various experiences over the past 2 weeks and then bang on time the coach turned up - bikes and bums on board and off we went. 22hrs later without any mishaps the coach deposited me in good old blightly and then 1.5hrs and 20miles later I arrived home.
"
113,"- Well I got all the BPF stamps for the cards I took with me- I got some good training miles in; about 950 of them- I got lots of good warm early summer weather- I had no punctures or other bike problems What went wrong, or in some cases just slightly out of kilt........ - I got some bad and cool to cold weather at times as well, but then that      should be expected before high season, even in France. Also I was on higher ground (up to 800 metres), so what should I expect!- My one-man tent is very lightweight(about 1.5kgms) and the price I pay for lightness is a lightweight ground sheet which can't really cope when the ground gets really wet - it tended to soak through a bit.- I only took my lightweight sleeping bag and the price I paid for saving weight here was the need for additional clothing when the nights got really cool; but that was no big deal.- I took a lightweight single burner stove which uses screw-in cartridges which I have no problems getting replacements for in the U.K. It's a different matter in France though - couldn't get one anywhere! Next time I take my Trangia which uses Meths - no problems there.- I had some problems finding campsites open; out of the main tourist areas and particularly on the higher ground the French holiday season can be very short. A lot of sites only open from early/mid June(and some only from July1st) and then they shut again by the end of August or early Sept. Next time I take  an up to date campsite book.  Looking back at the above the negatives look to outweigh the positives but that doesn't relect the reality of the trip - I HAD A GREAT TIME!!"
114,"Because my girlfriend was away, and no one else was available to feed the cat, I had to keep this ride short. If I had more time I would have followed the entire race. Plus I would have taken my time on the way back and made a 2+ week tour out of it. As it was I only had 4 days! (Time to ride hard!!)"
115,  
116,          
117,"All hills and headwinds! Good ride nonetheless. Camp tonight is in the middle of a forest service road, that has been blocked by a fallen tree. Only about 15k from the top of Brasstown Bald. 211.31 km, 22 avg, 80.9 max, 9:34 time, 13897 odo. Hind sight... Yes it was a long day. It would have been nice other than the headwind! The camp was in the middle of a dirt road, but the tree would stop any 4x4's anyway."
118,"Short day with only one hill. It was 5k at 18% though. Good race Lance took 3rd I heard. Chippolini finished before the time limit :) Met up with another touring rider. He told me about a camp ground near by, so that is camp for the night. 24.39 km, 13.4 avg, 78.2 max, 1:49 time, 13922 odo. Hind sight... For those of you that don't know about Brasstown Bald, It is the highest point in Georgia! It has one section reported to be 27% grade and the average is 18%. It is a nice climb on a loaded touring bike (if you are insane... I am). My total weight was apx 100 kg. Now don't gag! That includes me 62 kg, plus my bike, trailer, and full touring gear, about 40 kg. It does not include water (apx 3 ltr). One thing I still don't understand is that I passed 3 riders going up. 4 passed me. I was the only one with a touring load and I passed 3 riders? Now I'm not Lance but passing 3? Maby I should start racing again? And of those 4 only one blew past. All the others slowly came around? That one was clearly a racer type on a 7 kg bike. My bike weighs more than double that. Then add in the trailer and camping gear..."
119,"More normal touring day today. Hot! and humid! I guess that I wasn't paying much attention to the hills on day-1, because I have been suprised at just how long/steep some of the hills that I already rode are, When going this direction. Camp tonight is at a scenic overlook on a lightly travelled back highway. Horrible mosquitos and ultra annoying flies, I couldn't get the tent up fast enough. 129.06 km, 21.3 avg, 80.9 max, 6:03 time, 14051 time. Hind sight... I had my first ""get off the road!"" Georgia driver today. Moron yelled out the passenger window. Then about 30 seconds later when I cought back up to the pick up at the red light (no I didn't sprint) I said ""Maam it is ILLEGAL to ride a bike on the sidewalk"" Then I made a right into McDonalds for some $1 doubble cheese burgers. What are these people thinking? Oh yeah... THEY AREN'T!!
"
120,"Hind sight... I was glad to get home and the cat (Hoshi) was even more excited for me to get home. The rain today knocked out my bike computer. I found out later that there had been 4"" in one hour on my ride. I later that day fixed the problem with the computer in the rain. (For those aspiring wrenches out there... A small dab of grease on the contacts.) This ""tour"" was short, too short. It was also too rushed.
"
121,"In the course of riding of course I was casing the place- and it seems now will be the time to put that information into use!! I had started planning this trip using McCaffertys Coaches to drop me at Miriam Vale and retrieve me at Bundaberg but the price was out of my present budget. While in the slough of despond the aforementioned domestic engineer said ""We will have two cars then for a while- why not drive to Rosedale and make it a circuit??"" Excellent suggestion-  so here is my projected itinerary- as at Monday 26-4-2004 Thursday night 20 May- drive to Rosedale pub for the night ready for early start in morn- secure car in someone's yard     day 1 to Miriam Vale pub- following the road up the railway line- Lowmead pub etc- highway riding too stressful and much greater chance of becoming road kill.     day 2- Miriam Vale to  Camelot Park   at Baffle Creek near Rules Beach. Great camp site with camp kitchen and bunk house- and will try to fit in camel ride to Rules Beach      day 3- Camelot back to Rosedale pick up car (if not stolen by now) and drive home.

122,"What would my dear mother have said!! She used to remind me I had ""signed the pledge"" at age 15- and here I am on a cycling pub crawl!! Or so it seems... I left for Rosedale (north of Bundaberg- southeast of Gladstone on map) around 7pm Thursday night  20.5.2004. Took the old Fairlane so better half can drive to the  kids near Biggenden. I often fall asleep when driving but this trip  proved different- only started feeling slightly droopy after Bundaberg. It was an interesting experience driving over the Cedars Crossing bridge at night on the Burnett River- no side rails and tight winding curves on each bank down to the river and bridge- but kept the speed down, focused on the far side and no hassles.  By the time I reached Rosedale around 9pm the pub had long since shut and was in darkness except for a faint light around the back. I drove  around and eased my way to the lit part of the building- it was so dark I shuffled along one step at a time. I knocked on the glass in the old French doors- quite a few times!! A little voice  inside said once ""I think there is someone out there!!"" Eventually  the licensee materialised and away we went to the caravan up the back. The licensee has only had the pub eleven months but is working hard to tidy it up- the old dormitory donga with the shower/toilet one end is to be moved  and replaced with modern cabins. There is a footy field beside the pub, and somehow the caravan park seems to spill over from the area behind the pub around behind the footy field. The licensee took great pleasure in showing me where the hundreds of people on the Cycle Queensland ride in September are going to camp.       The caravan was basic but clean and I enjoyed the rare pleasure of a good read in bed with a cuppa before turning the light off. I slept soundly enough- except for a couple of diesel-hauled goods trains that thundered past in the night. Didn't even mind that- love watching trains and the last nine years in a trainless town has left me feeling deprived. Took a leisurely departure in the morning- wandered around for a while with a cup of coffee and the camera taking in the area around the pub. Licensee was so intent on making sure he got his caravan key back he almost forgot to collect his fee!!      At Rosedale store I was made welcome and directed around the back with the car. It was quite entertaining loading the bike with one hand and throwing a plastic boomerang for two hyperactive dogs with the other- nice to know it will be well guarded!! As I worked the southbound Sunlander train thundered past- must take a trip somewhere before long on that with the bike. Trouble is Queensland trains only stop at major stations these days. Finally around 8am hit the road.      First stretch of several k's between Rosedale and Agnes Water turn-off (Hills Rd) rather unpleasant- narrow road with no shoulder and school buses and cars in profusion-Rosedale has P-10 school with quite a large secondary department. Shortly after the Agnes turn one of the locals turning out of his driveway stopped to chat. Col filled me in on much of the locality- and suggested the Lowmead-Miriam Vale stretch of dirt- which I had been warned not to try- was in fact quite OK. Hmmmm. The dirt to Lowmead was rather rough but not too bad. I revelled in the trains going past and generally really felt like a kid on a holiday.        Reached Lowmead around 11 I think (well I did spend quite some time talking by the road to Col) and was intrigued when some more locals suggested Miriam Vale road was fine. In fact it had escaped my memory that the Gorge Rd which I would taken from Lowmead out to the Tablelands Rd was quite hilly and rough dirt. Crunch time- must commit myself now or forever regret...well not quite- but yes I'll try. If the road proves too bad- I've got the time to turn around and head back.    Despite my gloomy fears the ride up the road following the railway line was superb. Good dirt- often so level and easy I would munch on a muesli bar leaning on the handlebars (unsafe I know!!) A very pleasant and therapeutic ride. Sometimes I was in full sunshine and other times riding through dappled sunlight from the trees lining the road. Sometimes the country was cleared farmland with a green belt along the road and other times it was full-on scrub.    As I crossed over Colosseum Creek near the junction with the Fingerboard Rd I came out into cleared land. There were some spectacular hills to the left and overall the scenery was breathtaking. I realise in hindsight a turn to the left would nearly have to lead to the Colosseum National Park- although it wasn't signposted. The last few ks were slightly rough gravel but it was still easy riding.    I hadn't really found anywhere to stop for lunch so when I reached Miriam Vale around 2.30 I was a tad shaky- silly move on my part and my nearest and dearest soundly berated me for my stupidity later. At my age I tend to look for tables and seats to eat a meal on- too awkward on the ground!! So I blew some money I couldn't afford on a meat pie and drinks instead of getting lunch out of my panniers!!      On my way into the pub I stopped to chat for a while with a couple having a quiet drink outside- so nice to just mooch along and enjoy the afternoon. The lady licensee behind the bar had even noted in the diary I would be coming in on a pushbike and gave me a key to the firedoor on the back verandah to make it easier to get the panniers upstairs. I had a great afternoon just wandering around and taking pics- except I forgot a pic of the front of the pub!!        Had decided to cook some tea out in one of the picnic areas up the main street- but when the time came just couldn't be bothered dragging the gear out. So I had noodles in a cup instead and some tinned fish and savoury biscuits while watching the news. Later I yakked with Ross while he watched TV and I wrote up my journal. My cosy room was great- everything was great- but somehow I seemed to wake up in the early hours- the highway one block away never stops and there always seems to be semis roaring past. Last time in the motel was worse- it was right on the highway!! Oh well- still much better than sleeping on the ground in a 2 man tent! I would highly recommend Miriam Vale pub to anyone travelling on a budget- comfy rooms, endless tea and coffee facilities and good shared showers- all for $22 a night and cheap meals downstairs if you want.     "
123,"   Day two started early- and slowly!! A couple of guys who were travelling from Grafton to Townsville from a family wedding surfaced around 5am- I was already awake so I decided I might as well rise too. One up all up!! Ross was already in his work clothes and contemplating breakfast so I joined him on the verandah with a heart-starting cup of coffee and we yakked for a while as we watched trains crossing over in the railway yards in the predawn darkness. It was a treat having access to an electric kettle and toaster for preparing breakfast, and considering the hour I rose I should have been away quite snappily. However somehow I just wasn't in a rush (long weekend fever!!) and it was after 8 by the time I had sent SMS's to friends, showered, dragged all my gear down the fire escape and set the bike up and had a yarn to the lady licensee.  The morning was quite chilly and I stopped by the edge of town to pull on some of yesterday's clothes as well!! Traffic was moderate as I headed down Fingerboard Rd- enough to be noticeable but not enough to be a worry.       As I reached the last couple of Ks which was dirt- sure enough there was Ross in his drilling rig. As he said- ""Be hard to miss it"".           I was shocked when I reached Fingerboard servo to find it had closed. So I parked the bike on a fence post tantalisingly close to the picnic table I had planned to use. Wasn't quite game to duck under the fence and use it- half way through a standing lunch (bit like a horse sleeping standing up!!) the elderly owner of the servo stepped out of his house and called out for me to use the table!! Thanks mate made my life easier!! Again moderate traffic on the Tableland Rd and glad to finally reach Crossroad Rd- well glad to leave the traffic behind but the rough dirt was a nuisance. Actually Crossroads Rd isn't overly long and before too many k's were up I was on bitumen Hills Rd heading for Baffle Creek. Before Baffle Ck is reached though I had to cross Euliiah Ck- a wide expanse of water as it is close to its junction with Baffle Ck. Quite scenic. For pics and some more description check out http://www.crazyguyonabike.com/doc/agnesxmas2003 ride 3-describes this area in some detail. Once over this bridge and into Baffle Creek area there are really quite a few houses- just not all that obvious because they are on acreage. This quiet area will be the next area to ""take off"" in the coming decade. I stopped at Baffle Ck store and caravan park for a quick drink and refill the water bottles- dum dum forgot to fill his water bottles at Miriam Vale didn't he and just had one litre of Staminade to last the morning out. There are 4 caravan parks in the Baffle Ck area- two here as you first reach the area and then the last two past Wartburg near Rules Beach. After Wartburg the bitumen ran out and with the constant traffic boy was the dirt rough!! The front pannier rack was flogging to and fro like a dunny door in a cyclone- Roy and Rosie in Bundaberg picked up that problem beginning of this year when they saw the bike on the car but procrastinator me had done nothing about it. The rack finally put the magnet for the bike computer out of action- lucky it didn't take out spokes!! Anyway showed it to mate when I came back and we have fix in mind- son no 2 is a boilermaker and pretty good with a light welder and a couple of light brackets to secure the flapping rack to the anchor point for the mudguards should do the trick. I was pleased when the turn came up for Camelot near Rules Beach (which is the end of the road)- I had been pushing hard to make it in enough time for my camel ride. So you can guess my disappointment when I arrived to find Eddie and camels at the annual festival at 1770/Agnes Water. No matter we'll be through the area again next Christmas hols. So 2.30 pm and all was quiet on the camel front- plenty of time to chill out. I was the only inmate at Camelot so I dropped my bedding off in the bunkroom and walked the bike to the well-appointed camp kitchen for some well-earned lunch. After that hit the bottom- what better than a kip on my comfy double-decker bed!!         All up an excellent quiet evening. I had intended to buy some meat at the Baffle Creek store but forgot- and I was kicking myself when I saw the good barbecue I could have used!! Miriam Vale I was going to visit the butcher for some snags for tea- and when I tested the bbq in the main st just in case found it didn't work!!        So nice to just read, write up the journal and chill out. The night was very quiet (apart from the occasional coughing camel!!) and I should have slept like a log- somehow I woke up in the early hours- must have been that afternoon kip- so I flicked on the bed light and finished reading the novel I had started earlier that afternoon. First book I have read in ages!
"
124,"Again with an early rise, and brisk movement- and still got away somewhere after 8 am. This time I was talking to Eddie's wife!! After bidding the dogs farewell I set off for Rosedale and the car. The return trip was uneventful- I was so glad to to see Wartburg and the bitumen. Watching the front panniers flogging to and fro on the rough dirt I made a mental note to stabilise them this time and not just talk about it- little realising what was ahead of me next weekend up the  Mary Valley .    Baffle Creek store I called in again- I could feel a ""sugar blank"" coming on- once every few months in the morning I get this sudden weak feeling that if I don't eat pretty soon I'll keel over. Proved in the past it is not good to ignore this one so had a drink and a meat pie and several bars from the pannier.   BELOW- I've heard of microwaveable utensils and food- but not mail!! Note the track in foreground where mailperson (must be PC!!) can whip around in their tiny  (read- fuel efficient) vehicle and pop the mail in the box without getting out of the vehicle.    Finally pushed off again- quite happy to be on the bitumen and enjoying the steady ride back to Rosedale. This time I was following the Coast Rd and Hills Rd right back to the T-junction with the Rosedale-Lowmead Rd. Felt odd to be riding with no bike computer- hope once I sort out the front pannier question the bike shop can fix in time for Monto- really want it back for that ride but can't afford another one.    Finally reached Rosedale around midday I think. Treated myself to an ice block at the store and went around the side for another enthusiastic canine reception as I loaded the bike on the car. Ever tried loading/unoading a bike with one hand and throwing a plastic boomerang for a dog with the other?? Really appreciated the kindness and helpfulness of the folk at the Rosedale store- if you are ever up that way and need anything- refreshments, food, papers etc call in- they have a well stocked store and will do all they can to help.   BELOW- the lovable mutts who went berserk catching boomerangs- well one caught and the second chased him-also there was a feisty brown chihuaha in there somewhere too!!    Some more of Rosedale       BELOW- Some time ago the community banded together and bought the Railway water tank for a community water supply.     BELOW- An old store in Rosedale now sells antiques from memory.    Tried establishing phone contact with Coral and kids at Dallarnil a couple of times but unsucessful- family on the Net took out the fixed phone and the mobile left in someone's car- the best of communications technology still thwarted by the human element!! No matter- good cup of coffee in Childers servo to unwind while waiting. Guess what I read?? Brochure on the Blue Mountains- hmm- good goal for 2005!!
"
125,"We live by the beach in a district which has only two access points- both heavily trafficked and neither of those points emerge anywhere near interesting touring country- still miles of through riding on highways to get anywhere. Scott from Madison in Wisconsin picked up on this very quickly when I sent him some maps a while ago- his first reaction was ""Where do you guys ride??"". So apart from some short local rides- we need to transport ourselves to suitable riding spots. We are a one car family (most times- just have a second car at time of writing as we make the transition to a new vehicle) and if I take the car away for the week-end it leaves the family short-changed for transport. Sometimes I have persuaded riding companions to take one of theirs- but often I ride solo. I was going to take McCafferty's to Miriam Vale and circuit from there- but it was going to cost well over $100 for me and the bike- bike alone was $50. I can get discount train fares for me and the bike to Victoria (two states away) for only double what it would have cost to bus a couple of hours north!! Anyone contemplating  Eastern Australia- check out NSW and Vic rail fares- book more than a fortnight in advance and you get your fares half-price- and only $12.50 each leg of the trip for the bike. Incredible value. Here the Sunlander and Spirit of the Outback will carry bikes- but their times not suitable for me and weekends. So I am still dependent on a car to ferry the bike somewhere- and if I am not doing a circuit then I also need someone in the family to chauffeur me. More lateral thinking needed!! If I ride this circuit again and bring some mates- I would add a day at least and work in Agnes Water/1770- turn left at Fingerboard/Tablelands Rd junction instead of right to to Crossroad and down to Baffle Ck. 4WD operator at Agnes offers great half-day trip through Deepwater National Park to Wreck Rock and camping reserve. The Agnes Water-Wreck Rock road through the National Park is heavy sand and I am sure you would not ride it even on conventional MTB. Very heavy going. However Wreck Rock to Baffle Creek acceptable dirt- and 4WD operator assured me he would carry bikes for the morning to Wreck Rock- so get good 4WD tour and then continue riding.  This would make a magic trip with elements of bush, beach and National Park. For anyone touring Queensland from a distance wanting to do this circuit- Miriam Vale is on the highway and serviced by coach. At the moment the train still stops- altho rumour has it this will cease soon. It would also be possible to coach to Agnes and maybe hire bikes at Agnes and start and finish circuit at Agnes Water. Anyone contemplating any of the above feel free to email me for help making arrangements. A great circuit- and I would definitely recomment it!! Cheers!
"
126,"But of course cricketers aren't the only ones who complete a round of sport in a day. Cyclists have been doing it for the last hundred years- right from the time when immaculately dressed chappies rode around on penny-farthing cycles with dageurrotype cameras and tripods slung over their shoulders. And I think many of these trips are every bit as worth recording as the longer trips of days and weeks. So here are some of mine.
"
127,"Booyal is situated on the Bruce Highway between Childers and Gin Gin. Heavy vehicles often use the Booyal - Biggenden road to access Highway 17- the New England Highway so it is not particularly safe for cyclists. I rode for several ks one day on the stretch between Dallarnil and Biggenden and was sprayed with urine from a passing cattle B-double- I'm not fussy but I don't fancy a dose of Q fever- which humans can contract from cattle infected with brucellosis (technically there shouldn't be any cattle with brucellosis now...)  Of course I soon realised road trains passing beside cyclists at high speed are a more immediate threat than Q fever!! So family dropped me at the Booyal Crossing road and I worked into the lower gears and pulled uphill for the Booyal Hall. It was a pleasure to look around and enjoy the mountains and the views, and after a couple of ups and downs several kilometres later I reached the Booyal Crossing on the Burnett River. This is a causeway crossing and it ponds the river. There are superb camp spots on both sides upstream and downstream and the times we have driven through there has always been families here enjoying themselves.     After the crossing it was low gears pulling up again out of the river. Between the river and the Goodnight Scrub turnoff there is a dirt stretch. After the Goodnight Scrub I eventually came to the Goodnight Scrub Hall. There are many smaller farms in this area and judging by the good repair of the hall there must be a strong community.      The next district shown on the maps is Morganville- although there is little indication when you reach the area. I found this area particularly interesting because there used to be a branch railway from the Mt Perry branch down through Wallaville to Morganville. The  road  here levelled out somewhat as I rode into farmland and the riding became easier.     Finally I reached the highway- and found a young policeman doing speed radar duty- he was a tad amused to see a guy my age wandering around on a cycle. After a brief chat he gave me instructions for Wallaville mostly off-road which suited me. This is all cane country and level riding- a real tourist cruise and open so plenty of view in comparison to the scrub of earlier.      Wallavilleis a compact little town which once operated a sugar mill. There is a major marshalling yards for the cane trains and I am almost positive the building in the yard would be the old Wallaville railway station. Many of these branch lines were sold to sugar mills when they closed- sometimes they were pulled up and the rail re used-elsewhere- sometimes they brought the gauge back to the standard 2'0' gauge for cane trains and the lines became part of the sugar network.  I think some of the Bullyard to Morganville line closer to Wallavile was converted to cane train track and the rest lifted.    The Wallaville to Bullyard road is interesting- the map shows settlements only a few kilometres apart- i don't think I have ever seen railway sidings so close together. Much of this is poor country, it becomes very hilly which makes riding harder work and from memory I pushed a few of the hills. The country is sometimes quite scrubby and in these parts these is little view.     The actual route to Bullyard isn't a straight line to the Bundaberg- Gin Gin Rd following the old railway route like some maps portrays- in fact there are are a couple of major turns in the last few kilometres to Bullyard.     The last stretch from Bullyard to Gin Gin was on a moderately busy main road so some care was needed riding.     I was pleased to see a bike path in the last stretch which ran along the golf course from memory and passed the High School. I finally cycled into Gin Gin in comfortable style past the old museum (which was the railway station and yard). All good rides involve a cake shop and I found a good one down the far end of the main street and wheeled my bike into their outdoor area where I phoned the family for my pick-up. While I waited I enjoyed an excellent cappucino- vive la bike riding!!
"
128,"I started the ride with the kids dropping me at Gayndah Wed night just on dusk- after we bought a new battery for the car. They helped me set the tent up and then headed for home. The camp area was on the edge of the Burnett River within sight of the main road bridge- not a bad possy- so long as you didnt mind sleeping on a lush carpet of khaki burr!! It was citrus picking time at Gayndah and the place was full of fruit pickers who were all pretty well behaved- went to bed early and they were up an hour before sunrise.      I seemed to have a sluggish start- just wasn't in a hurry and then started reading a book!! However I hit the road around 8 am and after purhasing a cup on the way out of town (replacing the one I left behind at the campsite at Queen Mary Falls) I headed out on the highway towards Biggenden. Several kilometres out of town I reached the Wetheron turn-off and headed for the railway line. Some 20ks later I reached Wetheron- one house and a sign!! All that is left of a railway siding. A few more kilometres down the road is Byrnestown- quite a substantial settlement of a dozen or so houses. Again the only trace remaining of the railways siding is the name board and the fencing.     Immediately after Byrnestown a left turn at a T junction saw me heading for Mingo Crossing on the Burnett and Mt Perry- 48 ks from memory. At this point the road became gravel and I discovered for whatever reason I seem to make sluggish progress on gravel- be interested to hear people's comments.    Mingo Crossing had changed dramatically since last year. A huge scar up the hillside at the creek just before and machinery crawling all over the landscape showed where a massive prestressed concrete bridge over 300 m long will span the Burnett River bank top to bank top because the new dam will put many metres of water over the old bridge.     I was vastly amused to see a traffic control guy rush out with his STOP sign as I breasted the previous hill- I think the feeling was mutual. Turned out the young fella manning the sign had grown up in Blackall and I ended up calling lunch break and having a very sociable time yarning with him. As I crossed the current bridge I looked upstream and saw the machinery setting up the footings for the new piles.     The road was dirt now and traffic was reasonable. I noticed there was significant 4WD traffic into the Kalliwa Connection Road- the turn-off to Goodnight Scrub nearest to Mt Perry- and inquiries revealed there is a second mine opening up up this road. At long last this sleepy area is being reinvigorated.  About 18ks out of Mt Perry I breathed a sigh of relief when the bitumen returned. Much of the road is unfenced and I stopped countless times to wheel the bike over cattle grids. The last one I had had enough and slowly rode over- was that impact sufficient to cause the broken spoke next day?? Mt Perry came into view a little after 3 pm and I found riding in on a bike you can really appreciate the size of the town as it once was when the mine and smelter were operating. The town area is really quite spread out and I love riding around Mt Perry and soaking up the old atmosphere. I headed for the store and a diet Coke fix- and as I recovered my breath the store owner obligingly filled me in on the latest town gossip and suggested an itinerary for the next day.       Wolca Reserve- my camp spot for the night- was only a few ks out of town at the old Wolca siding from the railway days. It has been set up as a mountain biking venue and has good camping facilities with showers and toilets (gas hot water wasn't working but I was prepared for that- I had my shower as soon as I arrived!!) There is a canteen with several picnic tables under skillion roofs pitched off the canteen- couldn't turn the lights on but there were power points to charge my mobile phone (no base of course). I spread all my kitchen gear out on one table and my bed on another before dark set and all up I had a comfy camp for the night. Next morning dawned glorious and I was on the road by 7 am. I reached the Wonbah Winery turn at 8ish- bummer they didnt open until 9.30 am. After thinking hard I finally opted to press on for Boolbunda tunnel- around 190 m from memory and carved out of solid rock in 1882-1883- the longest unsupported tunnel in the southern hemisphere. The copper from Mt Perry turned Bundaberg into a vigorous port- although oddly enough by the time the railway opened world copper prices had slumped and the mine and smelter had closed! The line was finally closed in 1962 back to Gin Gin and closed entirely in early 1990's.    It was an unreal experience heading into a dark tunnel on a pushbike. I'd forgotten my headlights- discovered on the return journey they did nothing anyway- and the best I could hope for was to focus on the light at the end and use my peripheral vision as best I could to avoid the walls of the tunnel. I was also hoping no-one had left anything on the roadway since the last car had passed through!! Midway I stopped to enjoy the colony of rare bats that live in the tunnel part of the year. They were quite noisy, not to mention smelly (!) and it was unreal to sense them fly around overhead and squeaking furiously.  Only 17ks from Gin Gin disaster struck not far after Moolboolaman siding. I was fortunate a car was close behind me and offered to ferry me and the bike into Gin Gin. The generous ride was gratefully accepted- but I really cringed when the woman (in her early 40s) was heard to say to a friend- ""oh at the moment I am taking this old man into Gin Gin""...I would be lucky to have been any more than ten years older than her!!... I found the bike shop in Gin Gin and retired to the cafe nearby for a cappucino and meat pie while the bike was fixed. However as I said there were still problems- I used my mobile to contact my regular bike mechanic- and on his advice I aborted the ride.  However I covered the stretch I really wanted to see- Gayndah to Mt Perry- and the remainder of the trip I had already covered in the previous entry in this journal. Just would have been interesting to see what a night in the Wallaville pub would have been like...
"
129,"After a little thought I opted for a ride to Teddington Weir- 11ks from Tinana and then another 20 odd ks through Bidwill to the Tin Can Bay Road and back through Granville- total around 30-40 ks. I emailed Graham- he was happy to ride the full distance rather than return to Tinana to save time. Graham very kindly informed also me of the 4pm practice- so 11 am  arrival in Maryborough for me too.    BELOW- Last steep gully before the weir    Malcolm (MD of Muni 1) and Mark (percussionist extraordinaire) - both guys I have known and appreciated for many years- looked a tad horrified when I rocked up with a couple of bikes on the car and mentioned the ride!! Seems they haven't heard of such  crazy things!! After categorical assurances we would be back in time for practice we took off with light hearts. I found the traffic out to Tinana annoying but Graham was unfazed. Soon we reached the  Teddington turn and peace reigned. We were riding hills straightway but none of them overly  difficult and most of the early country was cane farms. Very scenic and very soothing after a busy week at work. There was a stiff and cool head wind which was annoying but bearable. Gradually as we approached the weir the country changed to scrubland and the hills became more ""interesting"". Soon we found ourselves following the large water main  feeding Maryborough. Although I was out of shape and the hills a tad steep I didn't walk- granny gear was enough and I wasn't admitting my poor shape to Graham after the consistent training he has done lately!! One last steep gully- and there was the picnic area of the weir.   BELOW- to the left of the weir wall is the fish ladder- first I have seen.    My nearest and dearest had thoughtfully packed ham and salad rolls so those and a couple of  juices made a capital lunch while we caught up on the events of the last six months. Time was passing all too fast and mindful of Mark's parting growl ""Well you had better be back by 3.30!!"" we hit the road again. The route through Granville took us over a causway at the foot of the  spillway and then the road  climbed up the far side of the spillway beside the fish ladder.      Once we pulled up out of the dam the country soon levelled out and was most pleasant  riding. The headwind was now more an easy crosswind and eventually we reached a T-junction  and the left turn found us heading for Bidwill.     The road here was incredibly wide and in  top condition and we absolutely flew. There was scarcely a car for kilometres and we had a ball  cycling at top speed side by side and talking as fast as we were riding. We have little idea  of speeds or distances because neither bike had a working computer.      Finally the Tin Can Bay road hove in sight and I knew we had only 5 kilometres to go. It was a  moving experience riding over the Ken Farthing Memorial Way on the Granville Bridge. Ken was a tenor horn player in Walkers Engineering Works Band (now Maryborough Brass) who was killed one afternoon cycling home from work on the Granville Bridge (then with no footpath) only months before we moved to the area and I joined the band.            We took a leisurely ride back through town- I was counting on a coffee at the motel but when the Muddy Water Cafe hove in sight at the Marina- my question was ""What coffee Graham?? poverty or  posh?"" Quick check- 2.30- heaps of time- posh it is. While there we hatched the idea of texting/ talking to Malcolm or Mark on a mobile with a sad story of being lost/falls and busted lips or similar.  Regrettably Graham then realised he didn't have the numbers. (Note facial injuries from cycling are scary for anyone- ruinous for a brass player!!)                  On our way through Queens Park along the river we heard St Pauls bells tolling so we raced through town to the church opposite the Railway Station. For many years I'm sure St Pauls  bells (a full octave peal- from memory the tenor bell weighs a tonne) were the only fully  swung bells in Queensland where the bells are swung completely around on an axle by the bellringers.      There was a wedding party emerging from the church so we locked the bikes up out of sight of the church yard and vaulted the fence to shortcut inconspicuously to the door of the bell tower. A very steep staircase leads to the ringing chamber where the bellringers stand in a semicircle and haul on the ropes swinging those huge bells. One ringer calls the changes as they go. An experience that never fails to give me goose bumps.      >>> Part 2 of this page

130,"Hi, we're Joyce and Ernie Frey.  We're planning on riding the Southern Tier Route from San Diego, CA to Jacksonville, FL with our very good friend Phil Wheeler.  We'll be driving to San Diego and then start our ride on April 22nd. Ernie and I live and work part-time in Jacksonville, FL.  We have been fortunate to be able to retire early and start enjoying some of the little things in life while we're still young and healthy enough to be able to.  Bicycling is one of our favorite past-times, along with fly-fishing and quilting (Ernie doesn't care much for quilting, but is very good at picking out colors).  We've done several long distance rides, but nothing like this one.  One of our goals is to ride in every state, this will certainly check off several! Our plan for the trip started late in 2003 after Phil was diagnosed with leukemia.  He decided to retire and start pursuing some of his life long goals.  When he mentioned riding cross county, we just had to join him.  Our original plan was to have a driver with us so we could just ride every day.  Finding someone to join us in this capacity was a real challenge, but a volunteer from the Leukemia & Lymphoma Society joined up.  Unfortunately at the last minute, family responsibilities forced them to cancel.  We're still planning to have the truck with us, but will each drive half of each day. We plan to stay in motels as much as possible, but have a couple of days planned where camping will be our only option.  Early on, we planned the trip out by each day, considering mileage, terrain and availability of motels.  Since we are all from Florida, and haven't been able to train on any hills or at altitude, our plan may change very quickly at the beginning due to the MOUNTAINS coming out of California.  We are looking forward to this part of the trip though (check the journals out to make sure we're still feeling this way!). Phil here.... Phil Wheeler age 61 from Jacksonville, Florida.  Born in Chattanooga, TN, graduated Tennessee Tech and worked in Chattanooga, TN, Wilmington, DE, and Jacksonville, FL.  Recently retired to do more fun stuff - that's grandparent, get fit, cycle and travel.  The cycle and travel will be started with a cross country trip with great friends, Ernie and Joyce Frey.  We'll leave Jacksonville in their pick-up on April 18, and drive to San Diego then turn around and cycle back.  We had a driver to suppport the trip, but that failed and we want someone to go with us on the adventure - so if you are interested please contact us(click to show email). About a year ago I was diagnosed with leukemia and this ride will be a fund raiser for the Leukemia Lymphoma Society.    We are riding for the Leukemia & Lymphoma Society.  Donations can be made directly to the Society at 9143 Phillips Highway, Suite 130, Jacksonville, FL  32256. "
131,"Y'all have been great in helping us with our training, especially Debbie and Robert who play the music and just make suggestions.  We'll miss you all, but be thinking about you.  See you back in class in June!"
132,"We've finally started our trip!  Everyone kept asking ""Are you ready?""  You betcha! All we've been doing for the last month is ride, either on the trail or at spinning classes.  Let's just go! It's amazing how much stuff we packed into the truck; don't know how those riders without support carry all this stuff on their bikes.  I guess Ern's right - I am a high maintenance babe. We met Phil and Beverly for breakfast Saturday morning, talked to Kevin from the Jacksonville Times Union who is doing a web site on their Community Web Page, finished packing MORE stuff, and headed out at 9:30 am.  We made Houston at 10:30 pm.  It was a long day but felt great to finally get our trip started. April 19  we headed to LaCruces, NM.  This is new territory for me.  The yellow and purple wildflowers in the mediam of I-10 West of San Antonio were pretty.  The weather was overcast(need to get used to reporting on the weather) and LOTS of wind.   Ern says to say it's a long way across Texas! April 20  was a short drive into Phoenix, AZ where we stopped to spend the day with Ernie's brother and sister-in-law.  Many thanks to Bill and Mary for their hospitality and our last home cooked meal for a couple of weeks.  One more day into San Diego.  Looking forward to getting on the bike Thursday. April 21  we finally arrived San Diego!!!  Bike clothes are out, bikes are cleaned of the pounds of east Texas bugs and we're ready to go.  The hills out of San Diego are daunting to us Florida flat-landers.  Hopefully, tomorrow we're still as excited about the ride as we are tonight. Phil here.... The trip is going to be more ardent than I thought.  Time will tell.  The fun part starts Thursday as we leave San Diego.  We'll come back a lot slower than we came out. Phil here.... Well we are now in San Diego and tomorrow is the day to mount up.  For the last two weeks I've increased RAM memory, changed to Windows XP, learned about downloading musid, burning CDs and putting music in files for MP3 use.  Additionally, I've read instructions on a new digital camera and a new digital cell phone.  Tonight I'm skipping the instruction book on how to ride a bicycle cross country. After we got to SD, Ernie cleaned the bikes which had a prolific bug collection with the bottom layer Florida bugs and the top layer as California bugs.  Sandwiched between are Alababa, Mississippi, Louisana, Texas, New Mexico and Arizon bugs.  Joyce and I shopped for food and supplies and we tested the walkie talkies. From back home Beverly tells me that a good friend Cheryl sent a generous contribution for the Leukemia Lymphoma Society.  Thanks to her and to all others who are supporting or will support our cause.  She says that she is fine and the children and grandchildren are fine. Tomorrow we start our adventure.  It is effectively 19 consecutive MS 150 rides or 29 centuries.  Every turn of the wheel we are 22 meters closer to home. We are riding for the Leukemia & Lymphoma Society.  Donations can be made directly to the Society at 9143 Phillips Highway, Suite 130, Jacksonville, FL  32256. "
133,"Flats So Far: 1  Weather/Wind: Partly cloudy at the start, sunny and cool, wind out of the SW. Joyce here.... We finally got started!  After driving from the hotel to Dog Beach we reset speedometers, road out to the beach, took pictures then started out.  Ernie was in the truck first today, so he rode with us back to the truck.  Phil and I then proceeded to miss our first turn and had to backtrack.  Getting the bike setup and figuring out the maps was a bit difficult.  I rode with Phil to just past Santee then got in the truck.  Had a great ride, but need to figure out some other way of dealing with maps and directions, pulling them out of a back pocket, is just not going to work. Ernie here.... It was easier getting out of San Diego than originally thought.  Changed driving responsbilities with Joyce in East Santee.  The scenery was nice, last year's fire left an interesting perspective.  The valleys were really nice and green coming into Pine Valley, compared to all the rocks in the higher elevations.  Had to do some minor maintenance to Joyce's bike, but the other bikes are doing fine.  We toasted our first successful day with Peach Champagne. Phil here.... The day started with fog rolling in over San Diego with a SW wind.  We started at Dog Beach, rode the trail along the San Diego River through the traffic of San Diego suburbs.  The outside temperature warmed and body temperature warmed even more in the climb from sealevel to 4000'.  First flat at 32.5 miles.  Carrying no gear, the climb is tedious but not really challenging.  The scenery was beautiful, but the remnants of the fire and noise of the interstate were depressing.  Exiting I-8, the meadows were green and the sounds improved to singing tires and singing birds.  Drank beer, ate dinner, planned tomorrow, went to bed.  This ride is for the benefit of the Leukemia & Lymphoma Society.  Donations can be made directly to 9143 Phillips Highway, Suite 130, Jacksonville, FL 32256 "
134,"Phil 37 /15.2   Joyce 84 / 14.7 Flats So Far: 2  Weather/Wind: Severe clear (not a cloud in sight), 10-15 mph wind, some tailwinds in the Yuha Desert, but mostly headwinds. Ernie here.... Day started with good conversation and good coffee at the Pine Valley Java Shop.  Mugs sounds like a well travelled person.  The start out of Pine Valley Inn is interesting because its immediately up hill.  Saw our first western jack rabbit and a whole lot of Border Patrol.  For those who say the Patrol isn't working hard, you couldn't prove it by me - they're moving all over the place.  This was an interesting day because of the rolling hills and the AC course takes you within view of the US/Mexico border in several places.  The I-8 In-Ko-Pa pass is almost as exciting as Millinium Force at Cedar Point, OH.  The support through the desert for the second half of the day was fascinating.  Thank goodness for the music CDs.  Words for the day - trust the maps, don't over-anticipate the directions. Phil here.... I echo Ernie's comments about Mugs at the Pine Valley Java Shop.  Then I started driving today from the mountains and through the prairies, but expect it will be some time before we see the oceans white with foam.  We were in the eye of a dust devil which sand blasted everything.  The heat of the desert was thwarted by the SPF shirt recommended by Barlow (thanks Barlow!)  The ride was easy up to CR S29 which is also Drew Rd. between SR98 and Seeley.  That stretch must be maintained by a masochist for bicyclists.  The day ended with pizza and beer and renewed Internet capability. Joyce here.... Duct tape and a baggie solved my map and directions problems.  Afixed it to my aerobars, had Ern put my rear carrier on so there was nothing in my jersey pockets except Powerbars.  I had a super ride today!  Started out really nervous about the downhill that we had to do on I-8 after Ern and Phil told me about the drainage grates and 18-wheelers from yesterday.  Ernie rode with me this morning, we had a great time climbing hills and the 10-mile descent on I-8 wasn't as bad as anticipated.  There weren't any grates, but the wind was blowing hard enough to almost knock me off the bike.  We saw several jack rabbits, horny toad lizards and a snake crossing the road before the desert, nothing once we got into the desert.  Phil kept me company the second part of the day.  Everything was great until we turned onto a really bad road outside of Seeley.  The hotel wasn't a mile too soon, the AC and shower felt great.  The SPF shirts and 2-way radios were worth their weight in gold!   This ride benefits the Leukemia & Lymphoma Society.

135,"Phil 41 / 15.7 Joyce 41 / 13.3 Flats so far: 3 Weather/Wind: Severe clear, hot, 0-10 headwinds Joyce here.... It was like riding in a blast furnace today.  It was hot in the truck, it was even hotter on the bikes.  I was in the truck first today, then rode with Ern from Glamis where it cost $1 to use the bathroom, and $3 for a bag of ice!  I felt bad for Ernie because I was supposed to be his domistique for the second half of the ride today.  My legs were tired from yesterday and the wind was in our faces again, so it was hard for me to even maintain 12 mph.  One of the reasons for riding west to east were the prevailing winds from the west; still waiting for them. Phil here.... At 7 am we left the farm country of El Centro.  Plugged in the music and enjoyed the ride on the flat plains up to Brawley where we enjoyed breakfast even more at Brownie's.  Started into the desert after Brawley and rode steady to Glamis.  Earphones for the music was more pleasant than the roar of the dune buggies on the sand dunes.  At Glamis, I drove and Joyce rode.  Ernie rode the live long day.  Soon after Glamis we met a westbound rider named Edwin who was a true crazy guy on a bike.  He topped a hill on his Cannondale 1200 towing his gear in a trailer.  It was really weird that he wore cycle shorts, socks and shoes, but no shirt.  We were covered with sunscreen and protective clothing to save our bodies from the sun.  Rode into Palo Verde and found no vacancy.  So we drove into Blythe for the night and will backtrack tomorrow. Ernie here.... Today was my day for the full ride.  Phil and I got an early start and had a good quick ride up to Brawley.  Brownie's is highly recommended for breakfast if you're passing through Brawley.  Late in the day I was glad to have had that breakfast!  From El Centro to about 8 miles east of Brawley is all flat farm country, nice roads.  When you cross over the rim canal the terrain turns back to desert and on the horizon you can see the Imperial Sand Dunes which gives an interesting perspective when you get there.  They are higher than what they appear.  Fortunately, or unfortunately, we came through the dunes on a Saturday and they were highly used for recreation.  The riders in dune buggies and motorcycles seemed to be having alot of fun.  Glamis ended up being somewhat of a disappointment, but there was shade there and ice, wonderful, cold ice.  The haul out of Glamis was fairly flat and routine with the wind blowing in our face so the pace fell and my ride started to drag.  But then we came to a rolling section of washes, breaking the manontony of the the flat ride and picked my spirits up.  It was also interesting to see the green of the Palo Verde area ahead and gave me something to look forward to.  Meeting Edwin was also interesting  - to see someone who has picked up such an interest in bicycling in only a couple of years.  It was also interesting to see the Colorado River in Palo Verde as compared to the Colorado River I was familiar with in the Grand Canyon and how it has been much used and abused by the time it gets to California.

136,"Flats so far: 3 Weather / Wind: tidge on the warm side, a little north wind in the morning, quarterly south winds in the afternoon. Ernie here.... I'm glad to know my perceptions from yesterday were wrong - the Colorado River was much more alive than previous thought.  What I thought was the Colorado River wasn't.  It's also interesting that you shouldn't let first impressions change what you should do.  This morning when I drove up to get supplies at the J&J Market in Ripley, CA, my first impression was that the lady sitting at the picnic table wasn't going to be friendly.  It was just the opposite - she was extremely friendly and helpful.  My ride today was HOT and I was lucky enough to not have to ride in the construction zone on I-10.  Today was also a day for thinking about the trash that comes along the side of the road.  What was a house key doing tied to a purple shoelace?  I'm sure there's a story there.  My main hope for today was that I gave Phil some support, but it was HOT and the desert looks like a desert. Joyce here.... The landscape today reminded me of the old westerns - scrub and cactuses.  We made Arizona today!  My half day today was in the morning with Phil.  We crossed the Colorado River out of California right before getting onto I-10.  Unfortunately, the road was under construction and the shoulder was chewed up.  We were trying to balance on the far 6"" of shoulder looking for smooth road.  It got worse, or so we thought.  The eastbound lane was closed and detourned onto the westbound lane.  I scared a Highway Patrol who was sitting at the detour reading the morning paper when I knocked on his window to find out how far we could ride on the closed section.  We rode about 3 miles on new closed concrete before running out of road and having to then run with the rest of traffic in the westbound lane.  The truckers gave us alot of room though.  It was hot again today.  A bank thermometer in Blythe, CA read 87 at 9:30. Phil here.... We spent the nite in Blythe, CA and backtracked to Palo Verde to start today's ride.  Joyce and I were up first and we encountered our first attack dog on the road.  Fortunately we escaped.  We stopped 20 miles up the road in Blythe for breakfast.  I at like a pig.  I followed that by riding like a pig - a pig with a speech impediment that went boink, boink here, boink, boink there.  It was hotter than a pepper sprout on the road after 11:00.  Joyce had moved to the truck by then and Ernie and I suffered together.  Both Joyce and Ernie pulled well so finishing was not a problem.  Once I asked Ernie to stop under an I-10 overpass for a shade break and our chief scout Joyce found two other shade stops.  We drank enough fluids to flat a battleship but passed very little.  Had to eat a large dinner to keep my weight up.  In reflection of the day - a lesson everyone learns sometime is that your mind will quit before your body.  So, if you tell your mind to shut-up, you can do more.  This ride is being done for the Leukemia & Lymphona Society.

137,"Flats so far: 3 Weather/Wind: partly cloudy, headwinds, AGAIN Joyce here...It was my full day to ride today, a short day, into the hotel and showered by 2 pm.  Great road to ride on, but lots of trash along the sides.  Still mostly desert.  Saw quite a few tumbleweeds today and another rider coming westbound.  He was riding a mountain bike with all his gear on his back.  Didn't stop.  Looking forward to a half day tomorrow, then a day off in Phoenix on Wednesday.  The bike seat is getting hard. Ernie here....Started off the morning with a good breakfast at the only restaurant in Salome, so its a good thing it was good.  The ride out of Salome was my half day to start.  The road out was somewhat elevated and with the wind blowing in our face, we didn't make much time.  There was no reason to fight it, luckly today was a short day.  Saw a sign ""BE AWARE OF ANIMALS NEXT 80 MILES"".  Not sure what animals they're referring to because I don't think anything can live out here except rabbits, lizards and road runners.  This country sure makes you appreciate the downhills. Phil here....Just another day in Paradise.  Actually, leaving Salome and arriving in Wickenburg does touch on paradise.  Better restaurants and more civilization.  The road was great.  Was a short haul and the heat was just as intense, but the shorter exposure was a good thing.  We passed farm hands planting the fields - what a job that must be.  We enjoyed a great lunch at Frank's Deli and dinner prospects look terrific.

138,"Flats so far: 3 Weather/Wind: Sunny with light head winds (what else! Ernie here.... GREAT DAY!  Phil and I rode together and it was our first downhill start since starting in San Diego.  It was even cool.  We passed another rider in Wickenburg dressed in a sweatshirt and coveralls.  After all the riding we've done, it was nice to see 20+ mph on the speedometer again.  When we got back down to the valley floor, Phil and I started taking 1 mile pulls and the mileage really clicked off.  Taking Bill's suggestion of coming into Phoenix on US60 instead of AZ74 worked out well.  You could tell when we hit populated areas around Sunrise - the traffic picked up, our speed went down, but we still made good time and had a chance to take care of the personal necessities at Bill and Mary's.  It was a good day to ride a bicycle. Phil here.... We started the day at a fufu coffee shop, grub was sparse.  The road was smooth, downhill and Ernie and I hammered to our limits figuring it was going to be a short day.  It was a short day, but the downhill and quarterly wind let us hit our max trip speed.  We took off the Adventurer Cycling route to spend more time with Bill and Mary and enjoy their hospitality as we did on the drive out.  It was nice to have the flavor of home life enter our adventure.  After a splendid dinner and some communication, including photos and emails, we went to the motel.  I enjoyed a full dose of Biofreeze and slept extremely well. Joyce here... Change of plans today, but we're still on schedule.  The original plan was to ride from Wickenburg into Tempe, AZ which is on the east side of Phoenix, then take a day off.  We decided to split the ride into 2 short days and stay tonight in Peoria and visit with Bill and Mary again.  Thanks so much to them for letting us invade their home, do laundry, cleanup the truck and bikes and get our last home cooked meal until June.  I drove the whole route today, giving me a chance to write some postcards, listen to music and do some quilting."
139,"Flats so far: 3 Weather/Wind: hot, light winds (got VERY windy after we finished the ride. Ernie here... After a good day yesterday, the continuation of my ride was more frustrating dealing with metro Phoenix.  We started out at brother Bill's house where we packed up everything we left there last night.  I can't say thanks enough times for the hospitality.  Joyce and I worked our way northeast to the Arizone Canal Bike Path which is an interesting trail at the northern end and somewhat difficult to follow.  As you get more towards central Phoenix, the trail improves with tunnels for crossing under the main streets.  We also passed a water treatment plant on the other side of the canal - kind of a ""busman's holiday"".  The only wildlife today was ome crazy drivers and ducks in the canal, not the crazy drivers, just the ducks.  Once we left the trail and started towards Tempe, there were some areas without bike paths and were a bit tedious.  Again, it was a short day.  Priceline.com did a good job in finding us a Sheraton to stay where I enjoyed both the hot tub and the pool. Phil here... Today I drove all day, marking a couple of trouble areas along the route.  We got to the Sheraton East about 2 pm, checked in, and went to a Sports Bar for a quick lunch.  We mounted 1 new tire on Joyce's bike, 2 on Phil's and should be good to go over the mountains and hills. Joyce here.... Thanks again to Bill and Mary.  Dinner was great and I have all clean clothes again!  Since it was my day off yesterday, I rode with Ern out to Tempe.  Since we had quite a few areas that were going to be in town, we decided to make it a leisurely ride.  It wasn't very leisurely once we got off the bike path though.  It was lunch time and traffic was bad.  I much prefer riding out in the rural areas!  The afternoon was put to good use getting a haircut.  Forecast is for wind warnings tomorrw, but at least they'll be out of the SW.  Yeehaw!!"
140,"Flats So Far: 5 Weather: Sunny/partly cloudy in the 80's, S-SW winds Phil here.... There was nothing routine about today.  Things were either really good or really bad.  The really good things were nobody wound up on anyone's bumper, everyone stayed off the asphalt, cool temps, our first tailwind (a strong one) and some great downhills following the climbs.  The really bad things were Joyce and I were tarred by Arizona DOT.  Actually, the road was tarred and our bikes and bodies were tarred from the road surface.  Fortunately, neither of us got feathered.  Cleaning bikes and bodies took awhile tonight.  Another bad thing was 2 flats in the 75 mile ride.  The third bad thing happened on US60. Exiting the tunnel east of Superior, wind gusts to a measured 40 mph and probably higher, parts of hay bales were blown completely across the road, dust and rocks pummelled Ernie and me and finally, tight lanes in the hills made riding tense.  On one downhill, my max speed showed 51 mph, something neither my bike or I had ever seen before - yeehaw!  We ended the day in Globe, had a great host, Jay Mistery, at the Super 8 motel, followed by a great meal at Challo's Homemade Mexican Restaurant.  Biofreeze for the knees please. Ernie here.... It was my turn to drive the first half.  By the time I had picked up groceries and ice, Joyce and Phil were already 20 miles down the road in Apache Junction.  We stopped for breakfast which was great and then continued on US60.  I did not envy Phil and Joyce their section of the ride.  US60 had alot of traffic, or at least it appeared so to me and they ended up getting caught in some road construction.  Luckily for me it was right before the switch-out point.  My ride was good, there were several long climbs, one to 2600 feet before coming into Superior and then a climb to 4600 feet after Superior.  We were both lucky and unlucky to have the tailwind.  The wind as it came through some mountain draws did some strange things.  As the area decreased, the velocities increased and my bike was literally blown over one lane.  Thank goodness there weren't any copper-toting 18 wheelers behind me at the time.  At another point while I was standing holding onto my bike, the wind literally picked it up and blew it off the ground.  Phil was more trusting of Arizona DOT, as I only got to 46 mph.  The scenery was great and getting to Globe was wonderful.  I had one extra chore tonight - I had to vacuum out the truck because the wind blew hay in through the passenger-side windows that were down just a little bit for ventilation - most amazing phenomenom. Joyce here... Cross/tailwinds, ah the little things in life.  Phil and I left the Sheraton East in Mesa while Ern went in search of ice and Gatorades.  The course took us through the side roads of Mesa to Apache Junction where we had a great breakfast - 2 eggs, hasbrowns, toast, sausage and coffee for $1.99.  Like I said earlier - its the little things.  The wind was pushing us along US60 and the ride was going great until a section of the road (3 miles of it!) that DOT had just put fresh tar or - it was everywhere.  By the time we got through it there was so much tar on my tires and bike it must have weighed an extra 10 pounds.  Ern and I switched shortly after at Florence Junction where I had to take a Huggie wipe bath before getting into the truck.  Was glad to be in the truck the rest of the day because the winds really came up, gusting over 40 mph in some places.  At one point, the wind blew hay and gravel into the truck because the windows where just cracked for air."
141,"Flats So Far: 7 Weather/Winds: Cool, sunny, partly cloudy, tailwinds Joyce here.... It was a great day for a bike ride.  Back out in the country, cool and a tailwind.  When we left Globe this morning, it was a chilly 64 degrees.  After a short uphill, Ern and I hit what seemed like a 10 mile downhill.  In some long sections, the speedometer said 25 mph, the heartrate monitor wasn't even reading 100 and for a brief moment, VERY brief, I thought, this is kinda boring.  We stopped for lunch under a pine tree in Bylas where Phil served the house special of peanut butter, jelly or honey and bananas on tortillas.  Phil and I rode the rest of the way into Safford with a good tailwind pushing us along.  Saw several different types of cactus in bloom and snow up on the mountains.  Other than some quail we flushed up, there wasn't any other wildlife seen today, not even any cows or horses. Ernie here.... After an uphill start out of Globe, we had some great downhill runs.  One flat tire, some interesting road construction, some great scenery.  By road construction, I mean how the shoulders were prepared.  Some portions had rumble strips all the way across the shoulder, some were shallow strips (kind of like a bulldozer had driven down the side) and some of them were of the new cut version, deep enough to loose your bike in.  The scenery was great because of the high plains flora.  I've continued my streak and saw another roadrunner today.  I would like to see one up close, but you don't get long to look at them.  Actually saw a river with water in it - the Gila River.  Wasn't pretty, but it was water. Phil here.... Joyce and I rod in the afternoon.  If you could read a How-to book on how to ride a bicycle, it would say this afternoon.  We were downhill and downwind in easy rider mode.  The weather was cool, the scenery was great, as was the road to ride on.  A reflection on events - on our way to San Diego, I saw my first roadrunner, leaving Tempe, AZ I saw my first prairie dog.  I encountered my own lying eyes where they told me I was going downhill but my legs told me I was going uphill.  Yesterday I rode drops for alot of new reasons.  I climbed in drops for efficiency, I road there in wind gusts for stability, road downhill in the drops for both speed and stability.  Finally, I both prayed and cursed in the drops.  Day 9 my quads have adjusted to a routine and the pain has gone away.  No Biofreeze tonight."
142,"Flats so Far: 7 Weather/Wind: Severe clear, head winds Ernie here.... Started out in Safford after a reasonable evening sleep, unfortunately I was the only one that got sleep (thank goodness for earplugs).  As good as the day before had been, this day was as bad, at least to start.  The wind was out of the East in our faces down US70 was a struggle.  Turning onto AZ191 we started a long hard climb to our first pass at about 4600 feet.  The first 10 miles of AZ191 was straight and you could see the gentle rise and after awhile my mind made it look almost flat.  Then the climb really started, but the road was good and the climb was almost fun.  The downhill after the pass into Three-way was fast and Arizona DOT pulled a few surprises for us.  It's always interesting when you're at 30+ mph and the shoulder goes away.  At Three-way, we turned onto AZ78 and started the climb to Big Lue Pass - 6295 feet.  This really tested the Florida Flatlander.  The views were spectacular.  Joyce and Phil were a great help getting me over that Pass, the highest I've ever ridden over.  Coming down from the pass, Joyce and I passed an old homestead surrounded by the National Forest.  The fireplace and chimney close to the road had become a shrine where people had left mementos to various saints, family members and even thanking Jesus for a good elk hunt.  I wanted to leave something, so I left my yellow ribbon remembering the 5 riders killed on Hwy 21 south of Jacksonville several years ago.  During that portion of the ride, we had finally gotten back into hardwoods and pine trees.  After crossing into New Mexico, we came through an area of high plains, rolling grasslands which was really a change of pace from a few miles before.  Joyce pulled me into Buckhorn where we had our first camping experience.  We were told the temperature that evening was supposed to get to 34 degrees. Joyce here.... Today was the start of those days we couldn't train for - mountains and high altitude.  We had breakfast in Safford then I went in search of a grocery store.  Tonight was a camping night so we needed some one-pot food.  On the way out of stown, I stopped for gas at one the 3 or 4 stations in town.  For the self-serve price ($1.97) it was a full service station, got the gas pumped and windows cleaned by a very nice young man.  The rest of my morning was spent quilting and supporting Ern and Phil out on some of the highest grades we've seen so far.  Lunch was served tailgate style on the top of a hill east of a town called Three-way.  After lunch, Ern and I rode some more hills, my first 6000+ foot pass, Ern's second big pass for the day.  There were very few downhils and once passing into New Mexico, the road surface got real rough.  We finally made it into the Buckhorn RV park, had a shower, set up the tent, had dinner and were in bed by 8:30. Phil here.... Today was completely opposite of yesterday.  The good news - the temperature was cool, the cacti were in bloom and the road was good. The bad news - it was climbing with wind in our faces. After 43 miles, Joyce came out of the truck to ride and I drove.  The climbing continued and the grade increased.  The rock formation scenery was phenomenal.  Crossed the New Mexico border in the afternoon and went into Buckhorn for our first camping experience.  The night was clear, and the moon was yellow and the thermometer came tumbling down to just above freezing.  As premier campers, we all experienced the event."
143,"Flats so far: 7 Weather/Wind: Cold, clear, headwinds Phil here.... We woke early, had a sparten camping breakfast of oatmeal and cider then Joyce and I hit the trail.  We rode 37 miles uphill into the wind. One of the events for the day was crossing the Continental Divide then rode into Silver City where we eagerly captured a motel and ate lunch.  The Gila Bicycle Tour race covered some of the roads that we traveled, coincidentally it ended today near Silver City.  After cleaning up, we became tourists and went to Lake Roberts.  On our return to Silver City, Ernie spotted an RV with a cyclist beside and other bikes racked on the front.  We stopped and learned that this was Ed Williams who is also riding cross country for the Leukemia & Lymphoma Society.  Ed started from St. Augustine April 1 and we started from San Diego April 22.  It was a coincidence that we met.  We'll meet them for dinner tonight and share our experiences.  Again I would like to thank those who have made donations to the Leukemia & Lymphoma Society.  Also, I encourage people who have yet to make a donation to please do so. Joyce here.... The uphills, headwind and Continental Divide made for a slow day.  The headwinds are becoming routine and all hope for the prevailing west winds are lost.  What scenery I did see today was rolling hills, some covered in yellow wildflowers.  For most of the ride, I only saw the white line on the side of the road.  We changed plans alittle today and decided to stay in Silver City and play tourists for the afternoon. Ernie here.... Today was my day in the support vehicle.  Did cross the Continental Divide, got some great (at least I think they are) pictures of flowers and scenery and happy I didn't have to fight the wind and hills into Silver City."
144,"Flats so far: 7 Weather/Wind: Severe clear, cool.  No wind to start, but then headwinds again Joyce here.... It was a tough day.  Although there were no winds this morning and it was cool (actually wore a jacket and legwarmers), it was mostly uphill.  The quads, which haven't been sore since Phoenix now have a deep ache.  I rode with Ern out of Silver City, then with Phil at the 27 mile mark.  Ern parked up at Emory Pass then rode back down to ride up with us.  It was the highest point of the trip at 8228 feet.  The grade climbing wasn't too bad but there just wasn't any air to breathe.  Most of the scenery was missed as I climbed and watched the white line on the side of the road.  Coming down 9 miles of downhills and switchbacks on the other side of the pass into Hillsboro was a blast.  Got up to 37.9 mph - fastest I've even gone of the bike.  We got into Hillsboro (a semi-ghost town), got the last room in town; the owner of the motel and cafe made us the last of the chicken salad sandwiches (the cafe had closed an hour before we got there) and split our last beer (it's a dry county). Ernie here.... It was my turn to do a half day, the first half with Joyce.  And as it seems to be the pattern, the morning started uphill - a great way to start the day.  US180 out of Silver City had a good shoulder, traffic was heavier than expected.  When we turned onto NM152, we could start to see the activity at the Santa Rita Pit Mine.  It is a huge excavation.  We passed over the Mimbres River which started to get my fish fever up, but I don't think there were any there, or any big enough to catch.  I switched out with Phil at about 27 miles and started driving the support vehicle.  They have great rocks here.  I went up to the Emory Pass, parked the vehicle and rode down and met Phil and Joyce and then rode back up to the Pass with Joyce.  Chef Phil made wonderful rollups for lunch.  From there I came down the hill and started looking for a place to stay.  The last room in town and probably the most expensive of the trip so far.  A wonderfull lesson in economics. Phil here.... My day started in the truck looking for ice in Silver City.  I got gas and ice and drove out to meet Ernie and Joyce.  The weather was clear with less wind than other days.  We stopped at an active copper mine and I was amazed at the vast hole in the ground.  I guess that hole was 30 square miles.  Futher down the road, I got on the bicycle and rode with Joyce.  We climbed for about 12 miles to the highest elevation on the trip, a little over 8200 feet.  Us sea-level creatures heard our lungs scream for air at that altitude.  None of us needed a triple chain ring.  For curosity, I checked my average speed at the top which was 7.7 mph.  The downhill with switchbacks increased that to 12 mph for the trip today.  There were beautiful rock formations on the eastern slope and lots of pines, including Ponderosa pines on the western slope.  We rolled into Hillsboro just before 4 pm and watched them roll up the sidewalks.  As Sierra County is dry, we celebrated our trip through Three-way by splitting our last beer three ways."
145,"Flats so far: 7 Weather/wind: Severe clear, sunny in the 70's to 80's.  No wind until late Ernie here.... Starting off in Hillsboro I was riding with Phil.  We had a short downhill run and then we climbed for several miles and probably gained 600 feet while dealing with New Mexico DOT who were servicing the roadsides.  After that, it seemed to be downhill or flat all the way with Phil and I taking one mile pulls.  It was good to see 20+ mph on the speedometer again.  We left Hillsboro before we could have breakfast because the town was closed, but had a great breakfast in Arrey about 24 miles from Hillsboro (Charlie, you're missing some great food!)  The halfway point was in Hatch and Joyce found shade in front of the Casa de Peregrinos (home for pilgrims)  By the way, its for rent.  Joyce and I rode the second half which seemed to be more rolling than the first half with more dry washes and paralleled the Rio Grande. It was a good ride, I was happy to see Las Cruces again. Joyce here.... We left the semi-ghost town of Hillsboro this morning pretty much the same way we found it yesterday afternoon - nothing open except a very small grocery store which had just opened at 8 am.  I was in the truck this morning, so while Ern and Phil hit the road, I picked up a bag of ice and followed.  Coming up over a rise about 10 miles down the road there was a huge lake.  It certainly was a surprise to see in the middle of the desert.  Sprint PCS service also became available, so I picked up voicemails from the past 3 or 4 days and was able to check in on the conditions at home (thanks again Norm for taking care of my guys!).  The rest of the day was a surprise as well.  Phil and I switched in Hatch, the Chili pepper capital.  Riding from there to Las Cruces was all farm land, onions, alfalpha, oats, peppers and acres of pecan groves.  I was wondering how the pecan trees survived this arid place when we came upon a grove that had just been flooded and still had standing water in it.  We'll spend a day in Las Cruces doing laundry, journal updates at the library (the laptop PC has failed us) and sitting by the pool.  I might even take a nap tomorrow. Phil here.... Ernie and I started on a cool morning from Hillsboro and after a short climb it seemed downhill most of the way to Hatch.  The route paralleled the Rio Grande and was quite scenic.  South of Derry the road got much smoother.  This was a great day for riding a bicycle, clear blue skies, hardly any wind, courteous drivers and downhill or flat.  Joyce started riding in Hatch and I drove into Las Cruces.  We celebrated Cinco de Mayo on the 4th to avoid riding difficulties on the 6th.  Cinco de Mayo will be our first full day off to catch up on many things.  THIS RIDE IS BEING DONE TO SUPPORT THE LEUKEMIA & LYMPHOMA SOCIETY.

146,"Today was off the bicycles and into the stores, library and restaurants.  Joyce updated our journal, Ernie and I confirmed at the Outdoor Adventure Bicycle Shop.  I got a new pair of cycle shorts.  Now I have 2 good pairs, 1 fair pair, and 1 for emergency use, and 1 that's no use at all.  We've lugged our cameras everywhere in hopes of getting a photo of the evasive roadrunner.    After eating alot of Mexican food on Cinco de Mayo eve, we went to Lorenzo's Italian Restaurant.  When we arrived at Lorenzo's, a roadrunner strutted calmly across the parking lot and posed.  No cameras, no roadrunner photo.  The change was good for appetite and asshole.  Tomorrow will be our first deviation from the Adventure Cycling route.  We will leave Las Cruces and travel northeast to Cloudcroft, NM on our way to Carlsbad Caverns. Ernie here.... Today was a day for sleeping in, restocking supplies, and getting information.  While Phil and Joyce were doing their thing at the library, I went to the geneology section and found a G. Frey near Enid, OK at the turn of the century.  Don't know if he was any relation.  There was also a Mary Frey at the same post office.  I'll have to check with the relative when I get back.  Tomorrow's course should be interesting, another high mountain pass just when we thought they were done. Joyce here.... Today was the first day since leaving on our trip April 18 that we spent in the same place as the day before.  For those of you following from the beginning, remember all that stuff we packed into the truck?  Well about half of it comes in with us every night and then gets loaded again in the morning.  I didn't miss that part of our routine.  It felt great to sleep in this morning, have a leisurely breakfast, then spend the day getting all the errands run.  We did get to see alot of Las Cruces, its actually a pretty neat area.  I ate way too much today (since no calories were burned cycling) but expect alot of it to get used up tomorrow on an unplanned climb.  Actually looking forward to getting back on the bike again"
147,"Weather/Wind: Partly cloudy, hot at 4,300' cool at 8,700'.  Winds guartering out of the north. Phil here.... After a day off, we left Las Cruces for a long days ride to Cloudcroft.  Joyce and I started on a great access road by US70.  When the access road stopped, the slight uphill we experienced turned a little more serious and we struggled through a gap called St. Augustine Gap (5,700').  The ride was alittle more fun as we entered the White Sands Military Proving Grounds.  It was downhill to flat and Joyce and Ernie swapped at the 43 mile mark.  Ernie and I rotated into Alamogordo.  Where there as an opportunity, Ernie did most of the work.  Joyce scouted restaurants and on Franchise Row picked Applebees where we were served by a sassy, cute waitress named Mary.  She brought her boss to meet us and he treated us to a dessert to honor our trip.  Ernie and I left the restaurant while Joyce got more ice.  Ernie and I turned the corner at 76 miles into the ride and were a little disappointed to see the sign stating that there would be a 4,315 foot climb over the next 16 miles.  It was a pretty ride, but it was damned hard.  Joyce found a cabin and it was my pleasure to assume the position with feet up on the wall while lying on the bed signifying the end of the ride.  We pushed daylight to the limits today and finished about 7:30 pm. Ernie here.... Today was a ride of opposites.  Started out in the White Sands Flats and ended up in the mountains.  It was interesting that we had to verify citizenship at the Border Station at the White Sands National Park.  Alamogordo was an interesting stop-over - its fun to meet people who can have fun and our waitress Mary could have fun.  Getting out of Alamogordo was somewhat tedious.  In one place, I had to get up on the sidewalk to get away from a Cadillac Escalade.  It's interesting that some people don't know how big their vehicles are.  The climb to Cloudcroft across the Sacramento Mountains - the grade wasn't too bad, it was more the 16 miles at grade and as we got up past the 6,000' mark, air got very thin and was hard to keep control of breathing.  This little side journey is now the highest of our trip at 8,670'.  It was an interesting experience in measuring your energy.  I don't know about Phil, but I kept watching the mile marks and trying to judge what I had left.  Thank God for that 39/28, it got me to the top. Joyce here.... Today was a deviation from the Adventure Cycling route.  Instead of going through El Paso, dealing with I-10 for a zillion miles and in order to see Carlsbad Caverns, we headed northeast to Cloudcroft, NM.  My day was the first half of what was supposed to be an 86 mile ride.  Getting out of Las Cruces was a struggle!  I kept thinking if this is what it feels like after a day off - no thanks, lets keep moving.  Phil and I kept climbing right from the start, and then it flatened as we entered the White Sands Missle Base.  At one of the rest areas on the side of the road, a group of motorcyclists gave us a standing ovation!  Ern and I switched out at 43 miles.  It turned out my part of the day was the easy piece.  The climbs where so steep and long, and the guys were getting tired, and I was getting worried that Cloudcroft wasn't ever going to get here.  When I finally found it, I stopped into the first motel to see if rooms were available.  Another patron who was trying to determine the same thing, told me no one was home.  Since I didn't want to spend alot of time driving around looking, I went next door to a pizza parlor and asked the guy behind the counter if he knew of a place to stay.  His response was amazing!  Mind you this is a very small place, the main part of town was about 4 blocks by 4 blocks.  He told me that he had only been in town about a year and didn't have any idea!  I continued out to the end of town and finally found a place called Buckhorn Cabins."
148,"Flats so Far: 9 Weather/Wind - partly cloudy, cool in the morning up at 8,760'; hot in the afternoon at 3,380'.  Headwinds came up around 11:30 am. Joyce here.... It was my lucky day.  The 90+ mile route for today was downhill to flat.  Ernie and I left Cloudcroft in the cold around 9:00.  After an hour, we stopped in Mayhill to shed our coats and legwarmers.  Our average at that point was over 20 mph because we had been going downhill the whole time.  The road was running next to a small stream in a valley between two mountain ranges.  It was so green compared to the slopes of the mountains.  There were vacation homes, ranches, and fields for what seemed like 30 miles.  We even saw quite a few deer this morning.  Ern and Phil changed out and about that time the wind came up.  We were watching the weather behind us today.  Earlier we had seen rain clouds to the west, over the mountains, that were actually raining, but it wasn't hitting the gound.  These same storms kept growing during the day, but we never got rained on.  The road also improved, in one county it was all brand new paving - so smooth!  We stopped for a tailgate lunch at a roadside park in Hope.  Other than two parks and a post office, there wasn't much to Hope.  From there, Phil and I rode into Artesia where Ern had found us a room. Riding up on the high plains today was almost like being at the top of the world - you can see forever in any direction. Phil here.... The day started in Cloudcroft - it was cool and clear.  After repairing a tube, I drove to catch up with Joyce and Ernie who were miles ahead.  Ernie and I swapped at the midpoint.  About that time the land got flat and ugly.  After 2 flats, Joyce and I rode into Artesia.  It was alittle downhill the whole way and we made pretty good time. Ernie here.... Hurray, 46 miles of downhill.  The first hour was hardly any pedaling at all and still managed over 20 mph average.  The scenery was nice, dropping down from the high mountains to the high plains and watching the change in vegetation.  And also geology, at least what geology you can see from roadside cuts.  Looking forward to seeing Carlsbad Caverns tomorrow."
149,"Flats so far: 9 Weather/Wind - cloudy, cool.  Winds - start assuming headwinds unless otherwise stated! Phil here.... Today's ride started in Aretsia and went a little downhill but into a headwind for the 37 miles that we road into Carlsbad.  We had breakfast in Carlsbad and met Wanda Murddocks, who had worked at Pete's Cafe for 42 years.  Pete's Cafe had a scale - my body weight is down 5 pounds with the trip one-third complete. We left Pete's Cafe and went to Carlsbad Caverns, a huge hole in the ground from which bats fly.  The caverns reminded me of Xanadu from Kubla Kahn.  The caverns were extraordinarily impressive.  We returned to the motel and did the wash.  I enjoyed visiting with some of the maintenance people around the motel.  We rode through Carlsbad looking for a place to eat and fortunately found the Pasta Cafe.  We enjoyed our best meal of the trip here in Carlsbad, NM.  Tomorrow we're off for Pecos, TX. Ernie here.... It was cold grey morning - 100% relative humidity - unusual for us to date on this trip.  The ride was going to be a farily short duration of only 37 miles, but mother nature, wanting to make sure we enjoyed our time on the bikes, made it as long as possible with interesting little rolling hills and a headwind.  The road was good, but you had to be aware of the gravel.  Saw our first live snake, a large non-poisnous type, didn't stick around to find out, making its way across a 4-lane divided highway.  I'm sure the Indians would say its a sign, but I don't know of what.  Luckily we've seen no owls.  Joyce, as usual, found a wonderful hotel.  Carlsbad Caverns was worth the change in course.  Looking forward to getting into the Central Time Zone tomorrow - having been raised in the Central Time Zone, it will be like going home. Joyce here.... It was a short day in the truck.  Since yesterday was my full day, and the ride was so short, we didn't do a switch at the the halfway.  After meeting Ern and Phil a couple of times on the road, I headed into Carlsbad to find a hotel that would give us a room at 10:00 am and have laundry facilities.  The second place checked out OK and by the time I headed back out, the guys were only two blocks away.  After a quick shower, breakfast at Pete's Cafe, some stories from Wanda of her childhood picking cotton in Oklahoma, we headed to the Caverns.  The Natural Entrance to the Caverns is a summertime nesting area for Cave Swallows - they were everywhere and so noisy - and boy did it smell!  The Caverns has a restaurant at 750' deep but we decided to get something to eat elsewhere after a Park Ranger told us they cover everything in plastic at night to keep the bats from pooping all over everything as they make their way out of the deep caves at night and back in in the morning - yuk!"
150,"Flats so far: 10 Weather/Wind: Mostly cloudy to start, clear to thunderstorms in the afternoon Ernie here.... Today started at O-Dark-Thirty, which was probably a good thing in hind-sight.  I was in the support vehicle so my day started finding fuel (in Carlsbad on a Sunday morning wasn't easy) and ice for the drinks which I got from Wal Mart where I met again today, Carlsbad restauranteur, Pete from Pete's Cafe.  I was able to catch Phil and Joyce outside of Loving and went to look for someplace for breakfast.  But there isn't anywhere for breakfast between Carlsbad and Pecos.  I traded out with Joyce at 45 and road with Phil on a very rough US285.  It's an amazing area - you can see for miles.  In fact, I measured one and ridge to ridge was four miles.  My portion of the ride was rolling from ridgeline to ridgeline.  Mother Nature provided entertainment this evening in the form of a thunderstorm.  I eventually had to pull the support vehicle up in a stairwell area to protect it from the hail. Phil here.... Happy Mother's Day to Mom, Lamb, Kristie and Tiffany.  My error started the day early as we left Carlsbad at 6:00 am Mountain Time to go south to Pecos, Tx in the Central Time Zone.  The morning ride had good roads, cool temperatures and a headwind.  Joyce and I saw a jackrabbit, a coyote, llamas and goats.  At the Texas border we stopped for photos.  When we resumed our ride, the road surface was rough.  From the Texas border to Pecos it was a true pain in the butt.  The monotonous scenery gave way to reflections on the matriarchs in my life commemorating Mother's Day.  Pecos, Tx is not a tourist mecca.  We did see rain for the first time on our trip, accompanied by thunder and lightning and mothball size hail.  For dinner tonight we puddle jumped to the motel next door.  While we were there we met two cyclists, one from New Zealand, the other from north of Amarillo, Tx who were riding to raise funds for eliminating partial birth abortions.  Their trip started in San Francisco and we've traveled some of the same highways on our trip.  Before we left the restaurant, nearly everyone there had gotten involved in our conversation.  The day ended with Ibuprofen and Biofreeze. Joyce here.... Anyone that knows Ern and I knows that it was a real chore for us to be up and gone by 6:00 am.  The way the day went though, it was a good thing we did leave early.  Unlike the past several days where the wind didn't come up until afternoon, it was blowing in our faces as we left the hotel.  The road was good and smooth though so that helped.  The section between Carlsbad and the Texas border was full of road gators that we had to dodge and was not good for skunks as we saw several dead ones.  We came past a farm with goats that came running to the fence to see us as we passed.  The roadside up to the Texas border was covered in purple, white and yellow wildflowers - it was also very green compared to what we have seen in the past couple days and what we eventually rode into.  Since we're going to be on US285 for another two days, I expect the road will be a tough one for two days.  It was quite a storm that blew up - I'm used to the thunder and lightning, but have never seen hail like this.  It was piled up against the door when we opened it after the storm passed."
151,"Flats So Far: 10 Weather/Wind: Mostly cloudy, 70's to start, watching rain clouds to the east. Joyce here.... We left the very depressing town of Pecos this morning for Fort Stockton.  We stopped at the Flying J Truck Stop for a quick breakfast because there is literally nothing for 50+ miles between these two towns.  Breakfast wasn't so quick though - the cook didn't know how to do poached eggs and had to find out how.  Once on the road, Ern and I made pretty good time because the road surface was good - for awhile.  It was rolling with not awhole lot out there besides scrub and wildflowers.  The ellusive roadrunner showed himself again this morning.  Ern and Phil switched at the 30+ mile mark, unfortunately about that time the road got bad and the headwinds came up.  We made Fort Stockton about 1:00 pm, leaving us plenty of time for a trip to the library for journal updates and then back to the motel for a nap.   We finally got a picture of the ellusive roadrunner.  Fort Stockton has a statue 20 feet long and 11 feet high of a roadrunner they have affectionately named Paisano Pete. Ernie here.... We got off to a good start today, but then we couldn't find our way into the Flying J Truck Stop.  Once we did get there, I confounded the cook by ordering poached eggs.  I'm not sure what they had to look up to find out how to cook poached eggs, but I eventually got them.  There was alot of water standing and humidity in the air from the rain the previous night.  The ride was good, the road was pretty good, the scenery was the same.  The conversation was good and the traffic treated us well, and I was lucky that my shift ended before the Texas DOT construction started.  Unfortunately, Joyce and Phil got to deal with the road contractor.  Fort Stockton was larger than I expected and we had a good dinner at K-Bob's Steakhouse and a comfortable room. Phil here.... It was a pleasure leaving Pecos, but it didn't come easy as we were temporarily held hostage at our breakfast stop, the Flying J Truck Stop.  While there, the New Mexico University women's track team came and left - they're faster than we are.  I drove the truck to Wal Mart (this stop and Dairy Queen are becoming pretty routine as we travel).  Down the road I met Joyce and Ernie on the road toward Fort Stockton.  At midpoint, Ernie and I swapped and Joyce and I rode over hill and dale into a headwind and reached Fort Stockton about 1 pm.  Ernie had us a room, we had a light lunch at the Subway and returned for a short nap.  Dinner at K-Bob's Steakhouse was a good west-Texas meal of steak and potatoes.  It rained again this afternoon and the temperature dropped to the low 60's.  Looking forward to a good ride tomorrow on the happy trails."
152,"Flats so far: 10 Weather: Severe clear, cool to start, heated up quick Ernie here.... Today was my day and I was not metnally prepared for it.  The scenery was more west Texas at the beginning and changed into mesas and valleys towards the end.  The roads proved to be a little rough for bicycling today, but probably great for 18 wheelers.  Today we found the major truck route through Texas, I believe.  I have to thank Phil and Joyce for pulling me through this day.  The only major occurrence was having a spoke pull out in my rear rim.  A call to the bike shop in Del Rio has been made and a rim has been found and will be waiting for me day after tomorrow.  We still have to figure out how that day will work, but with the planning skills of my two partners, I'm sure we'll work it out.  Cows and jack rabbits, that's all we saw from the bikes, but the wildflowers are in bloom so the roadsides are pretty. Phil here.... Wildflowers and cacti blooming along the roadsides made the trip tolerable.  Adding to the difficulty was a rough road surface and the traditional headwind.  Ernie and I pedalled together for 33 miles and Joyce had prepared lunch and we swapped, so I became the driver.  While photographing a bloomin cactus, I inadvertently encountered a live skunk.  Photo includes the cactus and the business end of the skunk.  Thank God the skunk didn't spray.  We rode into Sanderson had lunch, visited the library and prepared for tomorrow. Joyce here.... My day started in search of fresh fruit, ice and a Texas map.  Once all were found (am amazed that we've found a Wal Mart in every town so far - even the smallest ones), I headed out to find Ern and Phil.  Before finding them though, I found that Texas DOT had been at work ""improving"" US285 by regraveling and tarring it.  It was so rough that not even riding in the car lane gave much relief.  The new section ran out about the day's 15 mile mark and turned into just rough road.  Phil and I switched out at the midpoint where the tailgate special had been prepared alongside the powerline right of way.  It was hard riding - the rough road, watching behind for trucks (they are on you before you can hear them) and the stiff headwinds.  Once we determined Ern's wheel wobble was because of a broken rim, we slowed down even further in order to make it into Sanderson without racking the bikes.  It was a nice downhill into town though.  AS A GROUP, WE WANT TO THANK ALL THE LOCAL LIBRARIES WE HAVE USED SO FAR, AND WILL CONTINUE TO USE FOR UPDATING OUR JOURNAL.  THEY ARE A GREAT RESOURCE TO THE COMMUNITY AND PEOPLE PASSING THROUGH "
153,"Flats so far: 10 Weather: cloudy in the morning, sunny and breezy in the afternoon Phil here.... We left metropolitan Sanderson at 8:15 am with Ernie and I riding under cloudy skies, high humidity and gentle breezes.  Morning ride conditions were good.  I'm sure the scenery changed but it all appeared to be the same, cacti, scrub brush, sand and rocks.  Joyce and I rode in the afternoon where the conditions toughened as the sun came out, and the wind was in our face.  The course had more rolling hills as we approached Comstock.  It was nice to see a west Texas river that had water instead of sand and rocks.  It is the Pecos River.  The west Texas highway US90 is a rough road and tonight I feel as though I was rode rough and got put up wet. Ernie here.... I rode blind today, having to use Joyce's rear wheel on my bike for the first half of the day.  My speedometer didn't work.  So, basically, Phil and I played tag up and down the hills, not knowing how fast I was going up or down, just hanging on.  This may not be a bad thing.  I also didn't know how long we had been riding, so it was a surprise when I found out we had been riding for almost three hours.  The road was the same as we came into Texas on.  Texas DOT has not changed.  The asphalt in the town of Sanderson was different and it seemed to be like riding on glass - smooth.  It only lasted to the city limits.  After the change out, I supported Phil and Joyce for awhile and then they released me to blast into Del Rio to pick up the new rim.  And, as this is being written, I'm in the process of rebuilding the wheel, truing the wheel, and tensioning the wheel.  Any wheel builders out there who read this understand when you're on the road, you have to make due with what you have.  I had to use 14/15 butted spokes for the drive side.  We'll see how this works on down the road. Joyce here.... Today was tedious but routine.  We started at the No Name Cafe for breakfast.  In order for Ern to pick up his rim in Del Rio this afternoon, he and I switched riding sequences, he would ride first with Phil then after the switch and a couple of water stops, he'd head to the bike shop while Phil and I continued on to Comstock.  The rolling hill country of Texas is covered in cactus and scrub trees.  And since there appears to be more moisture, bugs.  While sitting in the truck waiting for the guys, I had to continually chase flies and mosquitoes away.  And, while riding, I was beginning to feel like a windshield on a car.  Phil and I weren't a good match for riding the hills and unfortunately, I couldn't help him much with the second half of the ride.  He would fly down the hills and then I'd trudge past him on the next uphill.  The hills were all pretty much spaced without alot of flat between.  About 10 miles from the end, we approached a large bridge with a sign - Pecos River and No Diving From the Bridge.  I said to myself - you have to be kidding - who would dive off a bridge into three inches of water (the most we've seen in any river for weeks).  It turned out that the Pecos River has alot of water, and at the bridge is very deep.  It was actually beautiful riding across it.  Phil and I went back to take pictures and saw a herd of wild goats grazing on the shoreline about 150' below.  We've stayed in some small towns so far, and Comstock is probably right there with the smallest, but this hotel is the worst yet.  The beds are comfortable, but it's not a very clean place."
154,"Flats so Far: 10 Weather: Mostly cloudy, light rain Joyce here.... The good things about this morning were we were still on the bikes heading east, it was cool and we could see the truckers because they had their headlights on.  The bad things about this morning were a VERY strong headwind, the rough roads, drizzling rain and the rolling hills of west Texas.  The road surface and the rolling hills smoothed out though after about an hour and half when Ern and I came into the Amistad Recreation Area.  They stayed that way into Del Rio.  Ern and I made our way into Del Rio where Phil had found us a stop for lunch at Chili's.  When we went in, they told us they weren't serving lunch yet, but had stopped serving breakfast too.  As we started to leave, the manager told us to come back in, they'd be able to do breakfast for us.  Phil and I left for Bracketville - the roads got rough again and we were riding in the traffic lane watching for traffic behind and in front of us.  We ended the day at the Fort Clark Springs Inn, just outside of Bracketville. During the riding part of the day, no wildlife, only road kill - buzzard, owl, cardinal, swallow and a big snake.  After dinner at the country club, we did see deer, turkey and rabbits.  We also went to check out the community pool which was being filled with water from the spring.  This pool was huge - 50' x 150' at least with most of it in the 6' to 9' depth. Ernie here.... It appears we have gotten out of west Texas.  We have crossed the Pecos River and it's turned wet.  We started out under grey skies but that was the only difference in the view, it was grey, the terrain was the same.  I had seen it the day before on my drive into Del Rio, so I knew what to expect.  The trucks were easier to see, they had their lights on and the light mist was cool.  I only rode 30 miles which was good because it gave the spokes in the rebuilt rear wheel a chance to do whatever they were going to do.  In Del Rio, we had a great breakfast at Chili's while we watched the Sheriff's Department bring in charity arrestees and put them up in the mock jail.  Yes, in Texas Chili's is open for breakfast.  I then was lucky enough to make the Wal Mart run and then I had to dash to catch Joyce and Phil who had 8 miles of smooth road and made great time.  I got us a room at Fort Clark Spings which is a gated community in an old army base dating back to the 1840's.  The bikes were cleaned up in front of our room, which was in the old barracks where the horse soldiers stayed.  After dinner, we actually walked along a flowing stream with fish.  We have left west Texas. Phil here.... My morning started as the truck driver.  The only supplies needed were a bag of ice.  On this overcast misty morning, I met Ernie and Joyce down the road.  There is one danger point approaching Del Rio - a long two lane bridge.  The drivers were courteous as Ernie and Joyce rapidly crossed the bridge.  Breakfast at Chili's was a hoot as local law enforcement teamed with three professional actors provided the comedic relief from the rough roads of yesterday.  Joyce and I rode out of town on a smooth road that was pretty heavily travelled.  US90 eastbound to Bracketville was heavily travelled.  The road surface was rough enough so that at some point my watch fell off the handlebars and is lost and gone forever.  Bracketville ain't much of a town.  People should be proud to say they are from there instead of they live there.  A retirement community suburb of Bracketville is Fort Clark Springs.  Our lodging accomodations are the most expensive we've encountered yet.  This was offset by a well prepared dinner at the local country club.  After dinner we saw deer, turkey and bunnies along the roadside.  Tonight we'll be in bed early as counting lightning bugs seems to be the biggest entertainment.  According to the folks ahead of us on the eastbound route, the next two days on back roads will be testy."
155,"Flats so far: 10 Weather: Mostly cloudy in the morning, sunny to partly cloudy in the afternoon. Ernie here.... In Texas, it's surprising where you find good food!  Of the three choices for breakfast this morning, one was a small Mexican place but you could tell it was the place because there were no parking places out front and the trucks were stopped out on the highwgay, even two State Patrol cars.  Needless to say, it was a good breakfast.  TX 334 out of Bracketville was a country road and a pleasant ride.  Phil and I flushed up a number of quail and dove and even a turkey.  And the wildflowers were in bloom which made even the rough road tolerable.  Phil and I forded the Nueces River.  I took my shoes and socks off and walked through the water.  It's a beautiful river right now.  The water is crystal clear and got my fishing fever up.  After lunch it took awhile to get going again.  TX 337 out of Camp Wood was pretty torn up and DOT was putting in a couple of new bridges, so we had to bypass some roadwork.  But all the streams were running clear.  I was expecting a climb today, but I got more than I expected and the speedometer was back down to 6 mph.  But we made it and had a good ride into - where are we? Oh yeah - Leakey.  There is a bicycle tour group staying at the same motel.  The tour leader is Lawrence Walker who claims to have set up the Adventure Cycling route through Texas (www.coyoteguy.com).  He gave us more information on the ride tomorrow over to Kerrville and really got my interest up about the Guadaloupe River - we will cross it several times tomorrow.  Tomorrow I will have to break down and buy an out of state fishing license.  I can't pass up this much pretty water. Joyce here.... It's green again!  Instead of small scrub and cactus, rocks and sand, the hill country is tall trees, grasses and roadsides covered in yellow flowers and Indian Blanket.  The road surface hasn't improved any, but we're back in the country (deeper) there has been very little traffic today.  My morning in the truck was enjoyable watching goats, sheep, antelope, ostrichs and the rain clouds moving through.  We never got rained on, but in some places it had rained shortly before we got there.  At the lunch and switch out point in Montell, the sun came out.  Ern and I rode the last 30 miles for the day at an easy pace, enjoying the scenery, company, friendly bantering and climbing hills.  One of the hills past Camp Wood was a challenging climb, but had a great downhill run into Leakey. Phil here.... Today was about as good as it gets.  It started in an orange plywood building with breakfast.  Ernie and I rode the country roads and saw the Texas hill country wildlife.  Penned in were cattle, sheep, horses and goats.  Free-range were dove, quail, turkey and mule deer - a herd of about 20.  The Nueces River flowed about 8 - 12"" over the road surface so we forded it.  While Ernie put his shoes and socks back on, I found rocks for Sam & Charlie (special grandchildren).  We turned north on TX 55 into a fairly stiff headwind but soon after, stopped for lunch at Montell.  Joyce had parked in front of an abandoned, collapsing, old country store.  As we finished our tailgate lunch along came one of the wierder characters we've met on the trip.  She drove up in her big white pickup with the animal shield on the front and two Australian Sheep dogs in the cab.  She immediately asked if we wanted to buy the place as her father had been the owner and had recently passed on.  It seemed her and her brother have a disagreement on what to do with this portion of the estate.  She wants to sell and he wants to keep it.  Only this morning she had spun donuts in his front yard in her fine white pickup and he had called the sheriff to place her in custody.  She came to photograph this worthless piece of property but her camera didn't work.  So Joyce and Ernie gave her two AA batteries.  She took the photo, screamed at the dogs, said a pleasant good-by and left the scene.  In the afternoon it was easier to drive the truck than it would have been to ride up TX 337 from Camp Wood to Leakey.  Leakey, with a population of 357 has two motels and compaground nearby.  We got the last room in town on this Friday night where the big drive is a local wedding, a Christian motorcylce group ride and bicycle tour hosted by Lawrence Walker of Kerrville, Tx.  We had a good Italian dinner then came back to listen to an accoustical guitar player and campfire.  This was a good day to mark the halfway point of our adventure."
156,"Flats so far: 10 Weather: Mostly cloudy, 70's, NO WIND! Phil here.... Today was a good day to ride.  It was heavy cloud cover, light traffic in the beginning and for a change, no wind.  Joyce and I started in the morning on TX 337 out of Leakey.  We rode up and down three hills that were not very long, but I think they were the steepest grades we've met.  If we grade the roads for riding a bicycle, Bandera County has my vote for the worst.  After expierincing rough roads in west Texas, I wore two pair of padded shorts today and I'm glad I did.  After a switch out and no lunch, Ernie and I road the rolling hills along the scenic Guadeloupe River.  This was a big change in scenery from the desert high plains and even the rocky hills of this morning.  It's nice to see the deep green color of grass and water landscape.  The small towns of Hunt and Ingram along the Guadeloupe River were quaint and enchanting.  Passing through them peaked my anticipation for Kerrville, the suburbs are better than the urban area of Kerrville which has a population of 20,000 people.  We'll stay in Kerrville tomorrow with a day off to visit the Guadeloupe and San Antonio. Joyce here.... Our moring started at the local breakfast restaurant where we ate with some of the bike tour group.  They were doing a 100 miles today - back on some of the same roads we had already ridden.  It was nice and cool to start this morning, but the first set of hills heated me right up.  I lost count of the number of big climbs we did today, just kept looking for the top.  The roads, which we thought couldn't get much worse, did in Banderas County.  On a long straight downhill, the bike started shaking so badly I thought the front wheel was going to come off.  I got scared when I couldn't slow down and instead of crashing on the rough pavement, I put it into a controlled crash.  Thank goodness no traffic was coming and I was just about stopped when I fell over.  No major damage to either of us.  We continued the ride over some more hills and through some big ranches before switching out with Ern.  My job while in the truck today was to get some picutres of the Guadeloupe River and surrounding area.  In some places where it crossed the road and it made for great photo opportunities, I had to double back just to find a place to park.  I arrived on the Main Street of Kerrville on Saturday afternoon with just about everyone else in town.  It was so crowed and unfortunately the only hotel close to the route was $100 a night.  We hade to go off course about four miles to find the other hotels in town which are situated around I-10.  Ern wants me to paddle him around in a canoe tomorrow while he fishes, so I guess my arms will get a workout and my butt and legs a rest. Ernie here.... This morning was my day to start in the truck.  After breakfast this morning, in what town? Lawtey? no Leakey, I chased around town to find a fishing license.  Having accomplished that, I filled the truck with gas, got two bags of ice and went out to find Joyce and Phil.  They weren't as far away as I thought because they ran into hills early on.  I supported them through the first half of the ride where they ran into more hills.  There was great scenery today.  My ride was the second half with Phil and he and I played on the rollers trying to keep our energy levels up so we could make the top of the next hill.  When we got to the Guadelope River I somewhat lost concentration and started looking at the water.  I noticed that the land owners in Texas are very protective of their water rights.  The whole river is fenced and private property, so access is limited.  We crossed the Guadeloupe several times on our way to Kerrville today and each time the river got larger.  I think tomorrow may be a day off and I'm looking forward to finding someplace to go fishing, now that I'm Texas legal."
157,"Today was the first day since our journey started that Ern and I beat Phil out of bed.  When we left at 6:45 am to go fishing, he was still sound asleep.  We found a spot for fishing at the La Casita Crossing of the Guadeloupe River - it was about 10 - 12 miles back on TX 27.  It took alot less time to get there in the truck.  I watched and read while Ern had a successful morning.  We came back to the hotel, changed and tried to find some place quick for breakfast at 11 am on a Sunday morning - not possible.  After a Crackle Barrel experience, we headed down to San Antonio where we toured the Alamo and the River Walk.  The River Walk is a very pretty area, and well used.  I was amazed at how busy it was on a Sunday afternoon.  Once back in Kerrville, I cleaned up the grear cluster on my bike while Ern replaced a sopke that had broken yesterday.  Phil and I then went to dinner at Chili's and then made the traditional Wal Mart stop.  We came back and picked up Ern for the traditional Dairy Queen stop. Phil here.... I slept in until 7:00, ate a small breakfast of three pancakes, read, talked on the phone and caught up on the news.  This afternoon we became tourists in San Antonio.  The Alamo is a well preserved shrine with interesting history.  Our tour of the River Walk was most enjoyable and a delight to see what a city can do for downtown tourism.  We had a small snack by the San Antonio River.  After returning to Kerrville, we had dinner, shopped, prepared for tomorrow and went to bed. Ernie here.... I CAUGHT FISH!  Bass and bream, small, but on a 2 pound leader even they were fun.  The water was so clear that you could actually see the fish take the fly.  As far as the visit to San Antonio, a person would be hard pressed to try to vizualize what the area looked like in 1836.  The River Walk is an interesting attraction, but I can't say too much for the water quality of the poor San Antonio River."
158,"Flats so far: 11 Weather: mostly cloudy in the morning, partly cloudy in the afternoon, 65 - 85 Joyce here.... Ern and I left Kerrville this morning the traditional way - uphill.  The wind was blowing already, but since the roads are so rough and the hills spaced as they are, it didn't really make any difference.  We were riding on TX 173 and missed our left hand turn (but didn't know it yet).  We hit a section of road that was so smooth, we just kept going and actually climbed two more hills before we came to Turtle Creek and realized we were off course.  So we back tracked and climbed those two hills again, found our turn and went back into the country.  This section of the hill country is more working ranches - horses, goats, sheep, cattle (even longhorns) where the past couple of days were ""exotic game"" hunting ranches.  Ernie and I had to take our shoes and socks off to ford the Guadeloupe at its first crossing for the day.  We crossed it several more times, but it wasn't over the road in those places.  We were starting to get worried about Phil when we didn't find him in Center Point.  We turned out onto US27 and shortly thereafter heard the walkie talkie buzz.  Ern couldn't ever get voice, so we rode into Comfort and waited at a convenience store.  I ended up using the cell phone to call because the walkie talkies still weren't working.  After meeting up with Phil, we got back on the road.  We had our traditional tailgate lunch of peanut butter rollups and then Phil and I headed out.  At this point the road surface smoothed out some and let us really start working the hills by going as fast as we could down to get up as far as we could before coming back off the big chain ring.  When we started to approach Wimberly, the traffic was steady and the road didn't have a shoulder.  It was really alittle stressful.  We eventually found a place to stay at the Wimberly Inn.  For a small motel, they have done a great job with all the gardens and the rooms are very nicely done.  There is a moving wall partition that can be used to separate the sleeping area from the sink and closet area.  Today, in addition to the horses, sheep, goats, longhorns and cattle, we saw deer and even had a turkey fly across the road in front of Phil and I. Ernie here.... It was my day to ride half a day with Joyce.  It was cool, cloudy, a good day to ride.  Still dealing with the Texas ""chip and seal"" roads and probably will for awhile, in fact we went out of our way when we got onto a smooth road.  We were lost in the smoothness, but crossed a creek we shouldn't have then turned around to find our road.  We forded the Guadeloupe which is really a pretty river.  We got turned around again in Center Point, but got ourselves back on course with the help of a friendly Texan and caught up with Phil in Comfort.  I'm beginning to think that Lawrence Walker has a thing for these Taxas roads and hills.  I changed out with Phil at the halfway point and supported Joyce and Phil into Wimberly. Phil here.... I started the day as the truck driver, brought ice and met Ernie and Joyce at an intersection.  I drove ahead 8 miles and waited for them to come but it didn't happen.  I back tracked and didn't find them, raced forward off course and didn't find them, turned down an alternate route towards Center Point and hunted for them on some back roads.  By now I was really panicked.  I got some call signals on the walkie talkie but we couldn't establish voice contact.  The calls themselves were a relief.  Soon Joyce called on the phone and said they were in Comfort which meant I was 9 miles behind them.  I raced to catch up and we spent the rest of the day scouting the route more carefully.  Today's course twisted and turned and the directions were difficult.  The course took us through beautiful country and down country roads and lanes with very little traffic.  The Guadeloupe River in the morning and the Blanco River in the afternoon were beautiful sights.  For the afternoon ride my rear tire had a slow leak so it was pumped every five or ten miles.  We hade many directional changes and the light winds relieved the heat.  It was a blessing even when it was a headwind.  Tonight I took both tires off and put super-glue in the cuts and duct tape as a barrier between the tire and tube.  I hope this works.  Besides the beautiful hill country, I believe we've hit the BBQ belt of Texas, a welcome relief from Tex-Mex.  Something you can really sink your teeth into.  After a large BBQ dinner, we made the traditional Dairy Queen stop.  I sat on the bench and watched the lightning bugs."
159,"Flats so far:  11 Weather: Mostly cloudy, rain in the AM, partly cloudy, hot and humid.  We are in the southeast again! Ernie here.... It started out grey with a hint of rain in the air and it took me awhile to get going because of bad roads and lots of traffic.  At 5 or 6 miles it started misting rain, nothing uncomfortable, but it was wet.  I found out something new about Texas chip & seal roads today - when it rains the smooth spots get slick.  Nothing critical happened like Joyce's controlled crash of a few days ago, but it made me be more cautious while the roads were wet.  As the clouds thinned and the traffic calmed down, I warmed up and my ride got a whole lot better.  I felt good and was able to push the hills during the day.  We had an interesting breakfast at a little Mexican restaurant in Kyle where you got your eggs anyway you wanted, as long as they were scrambled.  But the food was good.  The roads improved during the day.  I got alittle lost in Lockhart, TX at the switchout, but luckily I recognized my mistake before riding too far.  I could tell we had changed into east Texas by the change in the streams that we crossed.  We went from the clear creeks of the hill country to streams that are more silty.  The ride ended in Bastrop.  Phil found a wonderful motel and we enjoyed the rest of the day in the historic district.  It appears to be a nice little town. Joyce here.... While coming back from the Dairy Queen last night I spotted a coffee bar.  That was my first stop this morning since I was in the truck first.  That latte was so good - my last one way in Arizona someplace.  I found Ern and Phil out on FM3237 dealing with the Wimberly rush hour traffic.  The commuters didn't feel too good about us being out there as there were several blown horns.  After a couple of climbs and gradual descents, we left the hill country for east Texas.  The route today was on fairly busy roads, but farm country - and relatively flat compared to the last several days.  The weather has changed too.  On one of my first stops in the farm country, I noticed the high humidity, heat and mosquitos.  We are in the southeast again.  Since there were several route number changes today, I parked at each to make sure the guys got turned the right way.  The switchout was in Lockhart which appeared to be a quaint little town, but we were just passing through.  Phil and I switched at the Dairy Queen (no blizzards this time) and I met Ern up the road.  This part of the course had some rolling hills which gave me some trouble since my legs were tired from yesterday.  We arrived in Bastrop around 1:00, got showered, did some laundry, went for BBQ then went to the historic section of town.  I found another coffee bar, and yes, had another latte (it could be weeks before the next one!)  Later in the afternoon, I talked to Karen, then Phil and I went to the library to update journals.  Dinner was great at the Yacht Club, sitting outside on their deck overlooking the Colorado River.  We then made a Wal Mart stop and came back to prepare for tomorrow. Phil here.... Today marks the one month anniversary of our adventure.  We left Jacksonville April 18 westbound for San Diego.  Since April 22, we've been on the road on our bicycles.  It occurred to me today that traveling this mass country by bicycle adds new dimensions one does not experience by any other mode of travel.  Immediately, the physical effort is different.  The scenery changes slower and the sounds and smells enhance the experience.  A few days ago, the scenery changed to green grass from the burnt stubs of grass and shrubs.  Today it was time to breakout the gills again as the humidity is back.  The roads got smoother and flatter. The morning traffic and limited road shoulders made for tense riding.  18 miles down the road we stopped for breakfast in Kyle.  After that, traffic thinned as we rode on farm roads.  Joyce and I swapped in Lockhart and I drove.  Got to Bastrop, TX shortly after 1:00 PM and to celebrate being in the BBQ belt we all ate ribs for lunch.  This afternoon I shopped in Bastrop, a rare experience for me because Beverly does most of that in our household.  We enjoyed a great dinner at the Yacht Club.  We supplemented the Walton family income by going to Wal Mart."
160,"Flats so far: 11 Weather: Overcast until late morning, hot and humid Joyce here.... We left Bastrop after breakfast at a great home cooking restaurant down in the historic district, Maxine's.  Phil and I were on bikes, Ern in the truck to start the day.  The course took us through the Bastrop and Buchner State Parks.  For almost 15 miles we saw only two cars.  The road was shaded by tall pines and hardwoods, but had several steep climbs that required me to get off the seat to climb them.  My legs are still tired from Monday's 97 miler.  The rest of my part of the ride was on country roads where we saw cattle, horses and corn fields.  Ern and I did a quick switchout (no tailgate lunch) and then I started to mark the numerous turns.  Our stop today was supposed to be Burton, but the only place to stay in town was a B&B that's only open Friday and Saturday.  I talked with the clerk at the City Hall about camping alternatives and then went out to meet the guys at the turn.  We did stop in for lunch at the Burton Cafe, owned and operated by the Mayor.  Three big plates of roast beef and gravy, french fries, black eyed peas and peaches came to $17, tax and ice teas included.  We talked with one of the waitresses which gave us more information on the camping sites - specifically, yes, they did have showers.  So, off course we went to Rocky Point Campground (managed by ACOE), pitched tents, read, did some quilting and settled in for the evening. Ernie here.... My day started in the truck.  The truck is always interesting duty.  Today was gas and ice after a wonderful breakfast.  The truck is also interesting because after the supply duties are done, you have to find the riders.  Today I was on course, they were not.  I drove out to the switchout point and couldn't find them, so I doubled back.  Luckily I caught up with them as they came out of the State Park, they had missed a turn.  Today I also saw two more riders with trailers negotiating their way through the State Parks.  It didn't look like they wee having fun.  After finding Joyce and Phil, it was pretty standard support duty.  After Joyce and I switched out, Phil and I had a good ride.  The pace was quick, the roads smooth and the scenery interesting.  Had a great lunch in Burton and then headed to a local lake to camp.  Phil said this was the only lake he's been to that you had to ride uphill to get to.  Broke the fly rod out and taught the bream on how to be a bit more selective in their eating habits.  This was a good day. Phil here.... As we left Bastrop, we had breakfast at Maxine's where alot of locals eat.  The food was good and the waitress was also.  Joyce and I rode into the State Park, fortunately she had the cash to cover our entry fee of $1 each.  It was a shady ride but there were lots of short steep hills.  Some of them really made you gasp for breath.  We left the park and encountered the heat of the open road as we made our way through Winchester to the exchange where TX153 and US77 intersect.  The ride smoothed out with fewer hills and traffic increased.  We met Joyce for lunch at the Burton Cafe.  We were introduced to Leslie by the Mayor who said she'd been kicked out of most campgrounds so she should be a good advisor.  We took Leslie's advice and ended at Rocky Point campground on Lake Somerville.  Ernie fished, I swam and read, Joyce quilted and read.  Joyce prepared chicken and dumplings for dinner which were complemented with applesause and tortillas.  After dinner the winds calmed, the lake layed down and we had a pretty sunset.  God Bless Texas."
161,CELEBRATION PARTY! There will be a party at the Wheeler's home: 1953 Greenwood Ave. at 3:00 pm on June 5.  This is to honor those who have made donations to the Leukemia Lymphoma Socity.  Please plan to come and RSVP with a reply in the Guest book.
162,"Flats so far:  11 Weather: Hot, humid, some rain in the AM Ernie here.... It was tough getting started this morning after camping at Somerville Lake.  Sleeping in the tent and sleeping bag is not quite as restful.  Also, having to pack up all the stuff from camping took alittle longer.  But, we got off and had a good ride.  Roads were probably normal Texas, so I must be getting used to them.  The hills are getting smaller, but just as steep.  Lunch was in Navasota and that's where Phil and I changed out.  Phil found a great little diner - The Filling Station Cafe.  There we ran into three more riders who were going cross country eastbound.  After we changed out and I was in the support vehicle, I saw two more riders and stopped to talk to them.  They were local and just out for a long ride.  New Waverly was the end of the ride but there was no motel and Joyce had said she's staying in a motel tonight so we packed up the bikes and headed to where? Hillsboro?, no Huntsville.  It's my turn to ride tomorrow, so we'll drive back down to New Waverly for the start.  Tonight was spent tuning up the bike. Phil here.... Last night we camped at Rocky Point campgounds near someplace, not Burton, whatever.  The lake was beautiful and our second camping experience improved over the first because the temperature was reasonable and the scenery more beautiful.  My half day in the truck was uneventful.  After a great lunch, I started with Joyce for the second half of her ride.  We encountered the best road in Texas to ride on in Montgomery County in Sam Houston National Park.  This was followed by the worst road in Texas in Walker County.  The Sheriff of Walker County should arrest the road crew for producing such an abomination and calling it a highway.  Leaving Richards, TX we encountered our most persistent dog attack of the entire trip.  A white lab came after us seemingly intent on taking my right leg off.  We escaped unharmed.  We finished the ride in new Waverly and rode on up to Huntsville in the truck.  Somewhere on the Texas highways my front bearings had gone bad.  Ernie repacked them and showed me that I have one rough race and another one that is just fine.  That wheel will roll smoother tomorrow.  It was another BBQ dinner and early to bed. Joyce here.... The mockingbirds and doves woke us this morning.  We had a quick breakfast then packed up the camping gear.  I took a shower and headed out with Ern.  It was cloudy and we were rained on lightly twice within the first hour.  The roads were varied today, some great ones that were smooth with wide shoulders, normal Texas chip & seal and some that were even worse.  The Adventure Cycling route had us on TX105 then took side country roads over to Washington and then back on TX105 into Navasota.  TX105 was one of the good roads today, so smooth with a wide shoulder.  Ern and I were making great time when we got to the Washington turnoff - it was a no brainer - we stayed on TX105 into Navasota where we met Phil for lunch.  While there we met Howard, Bea and Scott who are also riding eastbound and journaling on ""crazyguyonabike"" under Ocean-to-Ocean.  Scott is from Buffalo, NY, it's such a small world sometimes.  Shortly after lunch, Phil and I entered the Sam Houston National Forest where the roads where great.  We had about 10 miles of it and just as I was thinking we had more good miles than bad today, we entered Walker County.  It was so rough we had to slow down to 7 to 10 mph.  This section was about five miles into New Waverly.  Both of us were glad to get off the bikes.  I was feeling great up until that road, by the time I got finished, my butt and shoulders were so sore.  While riding today, it was hard to believe we were still in Texas.  The weather and surroundings were just like riding in Ocala.  I only took one picture today.  We're in a motel tonight (yea!) in Huntsville."
163,"Flats so far: 11 Weather - Hot, humid, cloudy to start, then partly cloudy in the 90's Phil here.... Our day started in Huntsville as we drove to New Waverly to resume our journey.  Before mounting up, we had breakfast at the New Waverly Cafe.  Ernie and I started the day on bicycles with Joyce in the truck.  Today was the first day I felt like the hills are behind us.  We coastal riders should be right at home for the rest of our journey.  The animal life along the road was lifestock and guineas.  Today's roadkill changed in popularity from skunks to armadillos, another reason to feel at home.  The roads were good up to Libery County where the tar and gravel once more shook us relentlessly.  Joyce and I exchanged at Dolen where the general excitement was the single wide trailer owner mowing his yard with a weed-wacker.  After the ride we celebrated our last night in Texas with beers and snacks.  We ate dinner at Mama Jacks and tried to visit the library but it had closed at 5:30.  Tomorrow we are out of Texas - yee haw! Ernie here.... Today was my day for a full ride.  Because New Waverly had no place to stay, we overnighted in Hillsboro? Hillsboro?, whatever.  Got up, repacked the vehicle and headed for New Waverly.  Great little restaurant with good service and good pancakes.  After about two hours we were definately into the swamps of east Texas.  The humidity was back, the flora was very similar to North Florida and there were very few hills.  There's more population around too.  There were very few spots that were without people.  There were also alot more dogs than I had noticed previously, but they were all controlled by leashes or fences.  Good roads outnumbered bad and tonight there was a Dairy Queen.  Joyce and Phil were great riding partners today.  Joyce pulled me in for the last half and Phil set a good pace for this morning.  The bicycle seat got hard about 60 miles and I was glad to see Kountz, TX. Joyce here.... While preparing for the ride today, I met another rider from California heading east to St. Augustine.  He had originally started with Howard and Scott (who we met yesterday in Navasota) but had stopped near El Paso to visit relatives and then started out again by himself.  That makes about 12 people we've either seen or talked to that are out here too.  After stopping for ice, I waited at the route turns for the guys.  The quilt block I've been working on needs one more piece to be completed.  I brought eight blocks with me, just in case, but it looks like only one will be completed.  At the last water bottle refill stop before lunch and the switchout, I stopped in a store for ice and asked if there was a place to buy lunch in Dolen.  The cashier responded ""Honey, there ain't nothin' in Dolen!""  Well nothin' wasn't exactly right - there was a church, a small plant nursey and a couple of single side trailers around a lake.  Lunch was again the tailgate rollup while we were parked under two big cedar trees in the church yard.  My ride with Ern today was a good one.  There were more good roads than bad (by a long ways) and only 2 small bumps in the road to climb (won't even call them hills).  The only wildlife I saw today was two box turtles on the side of the road (couldn't tell if they were alive or dead) and a couple of egrets.  The birds have changed since we hit east Texas.  There weren't any of the swifts or swallows today that we've seen for what seems like weeks.  Mama Jacks was the only ""real"" restaurant in Kountz and it also sold all kinds of chotzke stuff - it was everywhere.  The Friday night special was a seafood buffet for $15.99, but we all ordered off the menu.  After dinner we came back to the hotel, retrieved the last load of laundry from the dryer, then went back out in search of the library and the Dairy Queen.  Once back in for the night, Ern and I went down to the hot tub for a soak."
164,"Flats so far: 11 Weather: Hot and humid, partly cloudy Phil here.... As we left Kountz, TX we knew that today would take us into Louisiana for our overnight in DeRidder.  Joyce and I left at 8:05 and rode up TX418 where the shoulder was a better surface than the highway.  Lots of log trucks and chip trucks passed us today along with a few tankers.  We caught a tailwind and rougher road surface on US92.  This part of east Texas has small farms instead of large ranches.  Our lunch stop in Kirbyville was at the Texas Rose Cafe where next door the livestock auction was in progress.  There were lots of cowboys at the Texas Rose Cafe, most of them probably thought we dressed funny.  Ernie and I left Kirbyville and about 20 miles later we crossed the Sabine River and finally left Texas - YEEHAW!  The road into DeRidder was smooth and straight and we made pretty good time.  The shoulder was wide with a deep cut singing strip and at one point a small pickup pulled off and completely blocked our lane, he didn't know or he didn't care.  We pulled into DeRidder where Joyce had arranged lodging at the Stagecoach Inn.  At 3:00 we thought a refreshing swim would be enjoyable.  We discovered the water was hotter than 40 hells.  So as a backup plan, everybody cleaned up and Joyce and Ernie made the Dairy Queen run.  Good habits are hard to break.  For dinner, we went to Mama Rosa's for Italian food.  Our next stop was the Wal Mart shopping trip.  We returned to the Stagecoach Inn for an exciting Saturday night of sleep. Ernie here.... Today I started in the support vehicle.  After four weeks, that duty is getting rather routine - make sure we have Gatorade, make sure we have ice, make sure we have clean water, then catch up to the riders on the road.  The countryside looks very familiar.  We are in the Gulf Coastal Plain.  Today while driving I did see another rider on a recumbent heading west.  We each gave a high five and went on our ways.  At lunch at the Texas Rose it was interesting to listen to the other tables talking about their animal husbandry.  I don't think PETA would be popular here.  They buy, sell, use and eat animals.  Hurray for Texas!  As in the famous joke ""they're doing their bit to prevent global warming by eating the cows""  My day of bicycle riding was fast and furious.  Phil was setting a blistering pace and with good roads it was fun. Joyce here.... I slept so hard last night that I never heard Phil leave this morning for breakfast.  He was coming back in when we woke up.  It was a great sleep, don't know why, but wish there were more nights like that.  Ern and I had a quick breakfast at the hotel Super 8 then packed up and off I went with Phil.  The first road, TX418 was wonderful, wide shoulders and smooth.  After about 6 miles though, the road got rough.  There were even a couple of small climbs today.  There were farms of horses and cattle along the way and you could tell they've had alot of rain here because the grass in the fields is such a bright green it's almost flourescent.  It was tough keeping up with Phil today.  He was riding really well and fast, I just tried to keep up and not get beat up too bad by the road.  It was one of those days though where the seat was hard and the chip & seal was making it harder.  When we stopped at the Texas Rose for lunch I changed into my normal support garb of denim jumper.  The waitress must have seen the look on my face both when I came in and after changing because she told me ""I bet that fells better, doesn't it!""  I couldn't have agreed more.  Today was the first day since we started riding that I was really glad to get off the bike.  The auction house was pretty busy - you could hear all the cows from the road.  We didn't go in, but headed on down the road.  Since the guys were moving so fast, support duty today was quick.  We did stop for pictures at the Louisiana border and I even did a little leaving Texas dance.  The hot tub was still to hot after dinner, so Ern and I used the pool which was as warm as a hot tub should be.  It felt great."
165,"Flats so far: 11 Weather: Mostly sunny, 81 degrees to start, 91 at the finish Joyce here.... Today was a much better ride than yesterday.  Ern and I started off on some great roads, little traffic, no trucks and a slight breeze.  The wind picked up as the miles went by though.  I think by the end it was blowing a gale from the southeast.  Of course today's route was alot of northeast!  It really was a great ride though.  We stopped in Mamou for lunch at the Mamou Seafood Restaurant.  We met Dale, a regular who was a crawfish truck driver.  He explained to us about how the rice paddies are done one year and then done in crawfish traps the next year.  Also the crawfish season will be over by the beginning of July.  He took me back to see how the crawfish are bagged as they are emptied from the traps each morning and then the owner, Chris, showed me some that had already been boiled up.  The crawfish in the bags were still alive and can stay that way four or five days as long as they're on ice or in water.  Ern had a crawfish Po-Boy sandwich which I tasted.  I think I like shrimp better.  The first section of the course was horse and cattle farms with a few hills and then it flattened out into rice paddies.  The drivers in Opelousas weren't very friendly to us.  Coming into town on US190 the road was one way, two lanes, no shoulder.  The right lane was very rough and the cars weren't giving us much room.  At the motel we met a construction worker, Pooh Aronahtay, who had been here several weeks working on the new Lowe's.  He was grilling corn, steaks, and chicken right outside our romm and ended up giving us two big plates full of home cooked food - it was great.  Saw lots of egrets and several types of herons today.  The gardenias are in bloom and can be smelled for a long way off. Ernie here.... It was an interesting pool at the Stagecoach Inn.  Last night Joyce and I had a refreshing soak in the pool which I judged to be about 104 degrees.  The hot tub part of the pool was almost ready for a crawfish boil.  A pool sized hot tub - now there's decadence.  We told the night management.  Hopefully they had it fixed, but it still wasn't cooled off by this morning.  After breakfast at the motel and packing up all the gear, Joyce and I started our ride.  The roads were fair in the beginning and then on LA28 the shoulder improved and it was good riding to the switchout - 7 miles east of Oberlin.  The road out of DeRidder was basically rolling hills but then leveled out into rice fields and crawfish paddies.  The second half of the day I was in the support vehicle, pretty standard duty, but on LA104 there isn't much shoulder so finding a place to park was sometimes difficult.  We washed the truck today and vacuumed out three weeks worth of stuff and got most the dirt off the outside.  But I think to get it back in good shape will take several weekends once we get back home.  Looking forward to tomorrow's ride, we're heading for the Mississippi River and the Atchafalya Swamp. Phil here.... Our day started with a sparse breakfast in the motel lobby.  At breakfast we met a westbound rider following the Adventure Cycling southern tier course, but he was doing it two weeks at a time.  Some people still have jobs.  He gave us advise on Opelousas lodging and in turn we convinced him to go to Kountz, TX instead of Silsbee.  These exchanges with other riders are productive.  I started as the truck driver and bought ice.  I met Joyce and Ernie down the road about 8 miles for their first stop.  We passed several Pentecostal churches and alot of dead snakes on the roads.  At the exchange point, the rice fields and crawfish ponds became the standard terrain.  Joyce and I rode about 20 miles to lunch.  The weather was mild and the breeze was gentle.  I had a shrimp Po-Boy and half a gallon of ice tea along with fried onion rings.  The fried food for lunch was like a lead lump in my belly.  I had noticed how the wind had picked up.  It really whips across the rice paddies. About every two miles the road had a 90 degree bend.  The wind was always in our right ear, sometimes from the front, sometimes from the back and it was hard to find a gear for comfort.  The farm drivers are more courteous than the urbanites who live in big cities like Opelousas, LA.  A late model Caddie almost leveled us.  After we got to the motel, things turned alot more pleasant.  Throughout the ride we had enhaled the odors given off by the Cajun cookers.  When we arrived at the motel parking lot, charcoal grills were at work and a nice young man gave us ribs, chicken, corn and rice from his grill.  Desert was another Dairy Queen delight.  I can only hope we're keeping our weight up on this trip."
166,"Ernie - 59 / 17.6   (3 hr 21Phil - 28 / 17.8Joyce - 31 / 17 Flats so far: 11 Weather: Partly cloudy, hot, humid, 90 at the end of the ride at 11:45 am Phil here.... Ernie and I left Opelousas on rough roads with moderate traffic.  Once we got far enough out of town, the road shoulder improved and we had the south wind at our back.  The road surface, terrain and wind made this an easy day to pedal.  The ditches, bayous, creeks and rivers are filled or overflowing their banks.  Louisiana had lots of rain last week.  The sun god continues to smile on us as the weather forecast along our route appears good through the weekend.  We met Joyce at the exchange point at a chicken yard by a bayou.  Driving the truck this afternoon was pretty routine, except for marking some route changes in the small town of Moreauville.  I found a Sportsmen Inn where the good news is we have a room at the only motel in town.  The bad news is it really isn't much of a room.  We ate well at lunch and dinner, did the wash and Joyce updated the journal.   Ernie here.... It was my day for the full ride.  It ended up being a short day, thank goodness, because it allowed us to get alot of things done.  I try to keep my comments positive, but I have no reason to ever go back to Opelousas.  It's frustrating to see a town with so much history in such a condition.  After the town of Washington, the roads improved, the traffic improved and my attitude improved.  Phil and I were able to carry a fast pace - we had most of the stars aligned and the ride went well until we got on Old LA1 into Simmesport.  The scenery was interesting with the levy and fields and livestock.  Something I noticed yesterday and noticed again today was that Louisiana has a distinctive odor of earthiness.  This is even more apparent in coming from the west where its so dry.  And, its not bad, its just an interesting characteristic.  While Joyce and Phil were in ""town"", I stayed at the motel and cleaned up the bikes.  Tonight at dinner we went to Rosie T's Diner adjacent to the Mattie Truck Stop.  The diner is in conjunction with a small        which we didn't visit.  The waitress and cook were working hard.  When we stopped for ice cream on our way out, we started talking with the cook who turned out to be Tommie Mattie, owner of the whole complex and also President of the Economic Development Council.  He talked to us about their efforts to bring industry into a 3,000 acre area on the Atachafalya. Joyce here.... We only needed ice and gas this morning.  So after packing up, my first stop was the Shell Station up the road.  I then headed out to find Ern and Phil prior to the turn onto LA103 in Washington.  The map addenda sheet had a note about a bridge being out and eastbound riders should stay on LA10.  I stopped at a pharmacy and found out that the bridge was recently opened and headed out that way to wait for the guys.  They never came by, and never responded to my call on the walkie-talkie.  I found them on LA10.  The rest of my support duty was uneventful.  The ride with Ern was quick until we hit Old LA1 - it was pretty rough.  The terrain today was alot of horse and cattle farms, corn, grains and sugar cane.  All the creeks and ditches were filled with water.  Old LA1 ran along the levy where cows and horses were fed.  As we came up to a herd of 20 or so cows, most lying down, they got spooked and started to stampede.  They all ran down the length of the road (on the other side of the fence) trying to stay ahead of us.  We finally passed them and they stopped.  Most of the cows or cattle that we've seen on this trip must not be accustomed to bikes.  We must make a different noise approaching because they have always stopped what they were doing and watch us go by, or run the other direction.  Simmesport appears to be a very poor town, just by the looks of the neighborhoods.  They did have a small library with two Interent stations.  This has been the only library on our whole trip that didn't have anyone it in.  Not even kids using the computer.  I sat for almost three hours and one young man about 12 or 13 came in to use the second machine for about 30 minutes, then right before I left, a young lady about 15 or 16 came in.  This motel is the second worst place we've stayed, but only by just!"
167,"Phil - 61 / 15.4   (3 hr 58Joyce - 33 / 15.9Ernie - 28 / 15.3 Flats so far:  11 Weather: Mostly sunny, hot and humid Joyce here.... Our day started at Rosie T's for breakfast.  That makes breakfast, lunch and dinner in the same place, good thing the food was good.  We found out how many trains run during the night on the tracks right behind the hotel - Phil heard two, I woke up for one, Ern didn't hear any - he's still wearing ear plugs every night.  Phil and I crossed the Atchafalya River then turned onto LA418 which ran along the levy.  The Mississippi was back there somewhere but we couldn't see it.  The road was OK and there was almost no traffic.  On the right side of the road were farms, miles of them with corn, beans and grains.  Some cows, too but less than the past couple of days.  The roadside for the past couple of days hasn't had many wildflowers.  Today it was loaded with Black-eyed Susans, large hemlocks in bloom and a purple flower I'll have to look up when I get home.  We crossed a large bridge with flood control gates right before coming into Marganza.  I wonder if the guy in the trailer on the other side of the gates gets any warning before they change the water level?  As Phil and I were approaching Morganza for the switchout, an 18-wheeler came by making a strange noise.  About 50 yards in front of us his right rear tire exploded.  Pieces of rubber went everywhere and really scared me.  I've never seen that happen before.  The driver parked his rig right across from where Ern was waiting for us.  As he walked by, he chuckled and asked if he scared us - YES!  My support duty in the truck was pretty standard today except for one thing.  We passed some big plantation homes and farms and CROSSED THE MISSISSIPPI RIVER in a ferry to get to St. Francisville.  We stopped there for lunch, then I headed into Jackson to find lodging.  The only thing available was two B&B's (they were open at least) but way too expensive.  We racked the bikes and came back into St. Francisville to stay at the Best Western. Phil here.... Today started earlier than planned.  The Sportsmen Inn in Simmesport is nestled between LA1 and a train track.  Two trains came through our motel room in the night.  I heard both, but didn't see either one.  After day break, we went to Rosie T's for breakfast where Margaret filled our bottles with ice and asked if we had a webpage.  Joyce gave her our webpage address and we promised to make her famous.  Margaret - here's your moment of fame.  Joyce and I rode across the Atchafalya River and turned into a headwind.  My lack of sleep and a rapidly developing sore butt degraded my attitude for the day.  The route came close to Angola State Prison where I think Cool Hand Luke was filmed.  We passed some beautiful homes, one reminded me of the homested in Cat on a Hot Tin Roof.  Soon after, we saw a sign for Big Daddy's Bar & Grill, nothing about Maggie the Cat.  As Joyce and I approached the switchout point, we experienced the most dangerous incident on our ride.  An 18-wheeler passed us and blew the tread off his right rear outside tire 50 yards in front of us.  The tread could have put us in a ditch, hospital or cemetary.  Timing is everything!  Ernie and I started our ride and I shared my miserable mood with him, but said I would do my best and try to keep it to myself.  Today's stage took us across the Mississippi River on a ferry.  Joyce found us a nice lunch spot at the Magnolia Cafe in St. Francisville, LA.  When we left the cafe there were only 11 miles remaining.  This was the prettiest 11 miles since the hill country of Texas.  We arrived in Jackson where we planned to spend the night but the two B&B enterprises wanted us to pay their mortgage for one night's rent.  So we racked the bikes and returned to St. Francisville for an affordable night's rest at the beautiful Best Western motel. Ernie here.... Thanks to foam earplugs, I didn't hear either train!  After a wonderful breakfast at Rosie T's, I started my truck duty by going next door to Mattie's Truck Stop and getting our normal 20 pounds of ice.  As I was finishing up, Tommie Mattie came by and asked how everything was going.  He said I should have come by the restaurant and they would have given us all the ice we wanted.  Nice guy!  I caught up to Joyce and Phil as they were going over the bridge at the Atchafalya River and marked LA418 for them.  LA418 runs along the levy that holds out the Mississippi River.  With Angola State Penitentiary across the river, I put the O'Brother Where Out Thou CD in the player and listened to the chain gang music.  Alot of agriculture in the bottomland and cattle on the levy.  The main wildlife today was a large field rat that crossed the road while I was driving the truck.  The switchout was in Morganza where I found some shade on the side of the road and waited for Phil and Joyce.  I saw them coming into town down the levy bridge while they were being passed by a large truck.  Then all I saw was a large cloud of dust and I thought the truck had run off the road.  But as Phil explained, it was much more exciting than that.  Phil and I rode LA420, which is another levy road, to the ferry crossing.  The timing on the ferry was perfect. It's good to be lucky, we were the last group onboard.  Their technique for loading the ferry was different than what I'm familiar with.  The cars circle on the ferry around the superstructure instead of lining up parrallel because it's side entry and exit.  There were a number of huge spent Mayflys on the ferry deck that would have caused a fish feeding frenzing on any other body of water.  But I don't know about the Mississippi.  St. Francisville, where we had lunch, is a pretty little town and seems to be doing quite well.  LA965, which is the road up to Jackson, LA was an exceptionally pretty ride with large canopy trees and rolling hills.  I was happy not to stay in Jackson, B&B's are not my thing.  I had to replace a broken spoke this evening on the rear wheel drive side (for those of you keeping up with bike maintenance) and it trued up nicely.  We couldn't fine a Dairy Queen tonight."
168,"Joyce - 83 / 16.2   (5 hour 6Ernie - 44 / 16.2Phil - 38 / 15.9 Flats so far: 12 Weather: Partly cloudy, hot, humid Joyce here.... The day started by changing a flat on my bike, repacking the truck, racking the bikes and then driving out to Jackson to start where we left off yesterday.  We had breakfast at the only place in town, but the pancakes were good.  While there, we met George Travis, a local, who helped us out with some route suggestions to get from Wiggins to Bayou La Batre, AL.  He had a Mississippi map which he gave us.  He is a descendent of Col. Travis from Alamo fame.  Ern and I then started out on the bikes on a different course than Adventure Cycling - LA10 to LA68 to LA10 to back on couse at LA422.  It was a beautiful course with large trees shading the road and great pavement.  LA422 was such a nice ride that we missed our turn.  We took alternate roads and finally met up with Phil at our turn at Woodland.  There were hills again today and some even caused the speed to drop to single digits.  Phil had lunch for us in Easleyville where he decided it was time for a change - pimento cheese spread and Orange Crush were added to the menu.  Phil and I then took off for Franklinton.  This section of our ride is a very poor area.  In most cases, the houses we passed all day were not much more than shacks.  We did however see one large plantation, Glenco which was started in 1870.  When we arrived in Franklinton, there was no motel in site and no Ernie on the radio.  I found a seat on a step by the side of the road and we waited.  He had gone back out to find us and somehow we missed each other.  Our stay tonight is at the Best Southern Motel that ranks pretty close with the worst.  It has a smell, it's warm and to flush the toilet you have to take the top off the tank and pull the chain.  Dinner was pretty sparse, but we did get milkshakes from Sonic.  I'm really getting tired of all the fried food, that's the only thing available. Ernie here.... We drove back over LA965 this morning on our way back to Jackson.  It was as pretty in the truck as it was on the bikes.  Breakfast was interesting, epecially talking to Mr. Travis and since we were already in Jackson it made sense to continue east instead of backtracking to LA421.  LA68 was also a pretty ride.  LA422 out of Norwood was a nice road and as Joyce said, too nice because we missed our turn.  LA38 and LA432 into Easleyville were also good roads for both scenery and pavement.  Alot of chip trucks and log trucks on the road, but the drivers were good to us.  At Easleyville, I changed out with Phil and started to drive the truck.  It was pretty routine duty in the truck marking route changes and providing liquid refreshment when necessary.  Franklinton is an interesting town with lots of truck traffic.  I think all the stop lights frustrate them because I've seen them on all the side streets trying to bypass LA10.  There is a large grain mill in Franklinton whose major product is dog food.  You can smell it all over the downtown section.  But interestingly, we saw very few dogs.  Tomorrow we will probably deviate from the Adventure Cycling course and take LA10 into Bogalusa and then LA26 to Wiggins, MS in search of a good motel.  I'll let y'all know how it goes. Phil here.... Last night's sleep was a masterpiece.  I enjoyed it so much that I slept until 6:30.  We racked up all the bikes and repeated our cycle route into Jackson to start our eastbound journey.  George Travis helped us out with local knowledge and provided us with a Mississippi map which helped us make decisions for the next two days.  I bought 10 pounds of ice which completely filled the cooler, but it wasn't enough for the day.  After lunch in Easleyville, Ernie and I swapped out and I got on my bicycle.  Ernie had the pleasure of buying ice in the town of Tangipahoa.  While Joyce and I rode, two people asked where we were headed today.  Although we invited them to come along, they seemed content with their livestyle in Louisiana.  This section of the ride is unique in that it has shade and hills while western Louisiana was as flat as a pancake.  For the cyclists considering an overnight in Franklinton, I recommend staying in Bogalusa or crawling in a culvert somewhere."
169,"Ernie - 82 / 15.7   (5 hr 12Phil - 49 / 15.9Joyce - 33 / 15.4 Flats so far: 13 Weather: Mostly sunny, hot, humid in the high 80's Ernie here.... It was my turn to ride all day.  We left out of Franklinton on LA10 deviating from the Adventure Cycling course to Bogalusa.  LA10 is a good road with shoulder, however, there are some logging and chip trucks. But there are logging trucks and chip trucks everywhere in eastern Louisiana and Mississippi.  It was a good ride to Bogalusa.  We stopped for breakfast at a cafe in Bogalusa right before the Pearl River Bridge.  As I said yesterday, we were going to try to take MS26 to Wiggins, but one look at it and we decided descretion was the better part of valor and got back on the Adventure Cycling course.  There was no shoulder on MS26 and the logging trucks and traffic was heavy.  The Adventure Cycling course is tedious with many twists and turns so you have to keep a close eye on distances and road signs.  In this section of the course, I saw more dogs than the whole rest of the trip - maybe we were just lucky.  Lunch was in Poplarville at a Wards near the course.  I think they have great root beer.  Phil checked with some tree trimmers at Wards about MS26 into Wiggins and they suggested not going that way.  So we stayed on the Adventure Cycling course which was tedious and we had to be careful with road signs, especially near the end at Perkinston.  There is roadwork going on on US49 and we will check out roads tomorrow to find the start of our course on Sunflower Rd, which didn't appear to be right across US49 where we stopped.  We racked the bikes at US49 and drove to Wiggins to say in a palacial Best Western. Phil here.... Ernie and I were first up today and we left Franklinton on LA10 (off course) with a wide shoulder all the way to the Bogalusa city limit.  On that ride we saw signs of Louisiana's governor sponsoring a statewide cleanup.  Inmates were providing the labor.  Since they had not cleaned up a piece of truck tire tread, a wire punctured my rear tire tube - its always the rear tire!  This provided us the opportunity to get up close and personal with the inmates.  Repairs made and back on the road we made pretty good time until we got to the Bogalusa city limits.  The shoulder narrowed, but the pulpwood trucks kept on hauling.  With the shoulder a half the width of a canteloupe, a log truck driver was revving his engine and blowing his horn.  He must be in training to be a New York City taxicab driver.  Joyce found us a good place to eat breakfast on the Pearl River at Duval's Restaurant.  We talked with a motorcycling couple and shared experiences.  We stopped for a photo shoot at the Mississippi state line where on MS26 there is no road shoulder.  We went back on course where Mississippi names their roads for people or sites instead of using numbers.  The Archie Wheat Rd. is a real nut buster.  I think every nut and bolt on my bicycle got a severe test.  Riding here made me feel like someone had strapped a concrete vibrator to my saddle.  To follow today's course, a well trained bloodhound would serve as a good guide.  I stopped riding in Poplarville and Joyce informed me how easy it would be to follow the route in the afternoon.  However, I needed the      hound.  We thought we were lost once, but were on course.  Moments later we thought we were on course, but found we were lost.  Apparently this is not unusual as a lady at the General Store had printed a local map specifically to help lost cyclists.  With her advise and the local map, we were able to make it to our destination where the course crosses US49.  Just beyond the road closed sign at the end of Ten Mile Rd. we racked the bikes for a short jaunt up US49 to Wiggins, where we have a high rating for our lodging experience.  Our last four evening experiences on lodging have been low, high, low, high.  Our destination tomorrow is the Gulf Coast city of Moss Point. Joyce here.... We didn't waste any time leaving Franklinton this morning.  It wasn't a very restful night and I was actually awake before Phil.  Not to break tradition though, I was the last one up.  The guys pulled out at 7:30 while I went in search of gas, water and ice.  The water at the hotel was so softened that none of us would even drink it.  The grocery store had ice, but no machine for water so I used a gallon that we had in the truck.  McDonald's provided a well needed cup of coffee and down LA10 in search I headed.  I was just starting to get nervous about not seeing them when about 1/2 mile up on the next hill, I spotted them changing a flat.  From there to Bogalusa it was pretty standard.  After breakfast at Duval's Restaurant we crossed the Mississippi state line - five states down, two more to go.  MS26 was         alley so back to the Adventure Cycling course we went.  The map and instructions were very difficult to follow because there are not road numbers, but names.  The directions went - 2.5 turn right onto Buck Branch School Rd.  3.5 turn left onto Humphrey Blvd and the 3.5 is not 3.5 miles from the turn on Buck Branch but from the start of the map sequence.  This meant turn in 1 mile.  The whole rest of the day went like this, and the roads were not very good either.  I think they hired someone from Texas.  Most of the course today was timberland.  Lots of pine trees and logging trucks.  There wasn't anywhere to stay in Perkinston so we racked and packed and headed for Wiggins.  We did laundry, got dinner at the Pizza Inn, came back to the hotel and prepared for tomorrow."
170,"Phil - 42 / 17.1   (2 hr 27Joyce - 25 / 17.1Ernie - 17 / 17.6 Flats so far: 14 Weather: Mostly sunny, hot, humid, high 80's Joyce here.... After a continental breakfast at the hotel, we packed and racked the bikes and headed south to Perkinston to begin the ride today.  At the corner of Sunflower Rd. we found an 18 wheeler loaded with beehives.  There was a netting over the entire flatbed load and bees clinging all over it.  The course today was similar to yesterday, in that we had to watch for mileage and road signs.  The first part of the ride, Phil and I rode through the Desoto National Forest.  There were also some very nice neighborhoods.  The terrain started out rolling but as we got further south, the hills kept shortning.  It was a short ride to Larue where Ern and I switched and I started marking route changes.  The plan was to ride to Moss Point (off course) from Vancleave providing MS57 had a shoulder.  If not, rack 'em again and drive to a motel.  Mississippi apparently doesn't believe in shoulders.  MS57 was newly paved, but the shoulder was about 15 inches wide and filled with a deep singing strip.  Rack 'em we did.  The motels in Moss Point (those that were available) were too expensive so we went to Ocean Springs where we found a Super 8 for $80 on Memorial Weekend.  We headed to lunch, the library for journal updates, back to the hotel to cleanup then relax before heading out to dinner.  Grilled shrimp and vegies tonight - nothing fried!! Ernie here.... Truck duty to start.  It was fairly easy to follow the map for this portion of the course.  The scenery was good but very little in the way of supplies was available.  Luckily we picked up ice and water at the Wal Mart in Wiggins before heading down to Sunflower Rd.  Joyce and I switched out at Larue which was basically an intersection with a church and a house.  I rode with Phil.  The roads were good and seemed to be fairly well marked.  We did see a racoon crossing the road - they have a very unique siloutte.  We'll start again tomorrow where we left off at MS57.  I had a broken spoke and flat tire today - the flat was due to a small piece of wire, probably from tire belting. Phil here.... My day started with a reflection of yesterday.  We crossed a river where kids were swimming in an old swimming hole.  It was like a Normal Rockwell painting.  A unique experience was seeing an 18 wheeler loaded with beehives and bees where we unracked the bikes this morning.  The roads were good today, pretty farm scenery and a number of attack dogs - big ones.  Today's ride was only 42 miles and the weather was mild.  Neither lunch nor dinner was dominated with fried food.  I believe somewhere in eastern Louisiana or western Mississippi someone is working on a way to fry every food known to man.  We're on the Gulf Coast on Memorial Day weekend and people have flocked here to celebrate.  Hopefully tomorrow's ride will avoid most of the tourist traffic."
171,"Joyce - 49 / 16.1   (3 hrErnie - 23 / 15.8Phil - 26 / 16.3 Flats so far: 16 Weather: Rain to start, partly sunny, high 80's Ernie here.... The morning started in Ocean Springs, one I-10 exit west of our starting point.  We racked the bikes, hauled them back to Vancleave where we found some shade to prepare ourselves for the day's ride.  I rode with Joyce this morning for the first half of the route.  The course was good, easy to follow, but we did have problems with a few dogs.  Nothing major, they where just expressing their territorialism.  There was quite a bit of traffic, but not as much as the second half of the ride.  We went through the Pascagoula River Wildlife Management Area which was pretty with alot of swampy river crossings.  It was also about that time we got caught in the rain storm.  It rained long enough to get us soaking wet, but no lightning.  We met Don Pulley at the turnoff of Old River Rd.  We passed one another several times during the ride.  I encountered one mechanical problem today - the rear tire did not want to stay on the rear rim.  I just hate that when it happens!  I changed out the tube and it seems to have fixed the problem, find out tomorrow for sure.  Phil and I changed out at the Mississippi / Alabama border when we did our photo op.  Truck duty was routine and our reservation in Bayou La Batre was surprising.  I searched for a dumpy motel, but found that we had reservations at a somewhat palacial abode.  Hurray for Joyce! Joyce here.... The clouds were already building and moving onshore as we packed the truck this morning.  When we got to Vancleave to start the ride, the air was pretty heavy and looking in my rear view mirror was dark.  The ride took us through country neighborhoods and the Pascagoula River area on smooth roads, only one of which had a shoulder.  The rain started while we were changing Ern's rear flat.  Since there wasn't any lightning, we continued to ride - everything was soaked, even shoes.  It only lasted about 30 minutes.  While at the Mississippi / Alabama border photo shoot and switchout, we met Don Pulley from Colorado who is riding the same eastbound course.  He's raising funds for a friend who has terminal cancer.  He's doing the camping thing, fully packed and doing 100 to 120 miles per day.  The second half of the ride was also on good roads, but Alabama doesn't believe in shoulders either.  The traffic was really bad.  Saturday's have been a tough day to ride, but the holiday is making it worse.  Phil and I had to stop to fix his rear tire flat, then we blasted the remaining 9 miles into Bayou La Batre.  It was good to get off the roads.  It was a nice afternoon - we got lunch, showered, I quilted, then cleaned up the bike.  Dinner was late, then we came back to prepare for an early morning. Phil here.... My day started in the truck as we all left Ocean Springs for the start point at Vancleave.  Ernie and Joyce rode off and I bought ice and caught them about 5 miles down the road.  Today's route was easier to follow than yesterday and the day before.  We switched out at the state line and after our group shot we photographed Don Pulley, a Colorado biker who's carrying 60 pounds of gear and has raised over $12,000 for his best friend who has terminal cancer.  Joyce and I rode after the rain shower.  I had a flat after about half way through the second part of today's ride.  After the repairs we crossed I-10 and traffic increased.  Joyce and I picked up the pace to get out of traffic and the possibility of another rain shower.  We ate well at both lunch and dinner.  I got a much needed haircut.  The barber was from Viet Nam and has lived in Boston, San Diego and Bayou La Batre.  His wife grew up in the same village in Viet Nam and they met in Bayou La Batre strictly by chance.  Tomorrow we'll start early in hopes of avoiding the traffic at Gulf Shores."
172,"Ernie - 75 / 16.2   (4 hr 35Phil - 41 / 16.1Joyce - 34 / 16.6 Flats so far: 17 Weather: Damn hot and humid.  Windy out of the SSW Ernie here.... Today was my day.  Knowing that we had a ferry to catch at Dauphin Island, Phil made the suggestion we get up and get out early to catch the first boat at 8:00.  Good suggestion.  To complicate the matter this morning, we found my rear tire was soft, but rather than take time to change it, we pumped it back up and took off.  Joyce caught us just in the nick of time as the tire was getting mushy again.  We pumped it again and took off.  We did that two more times before the big bridge onto Dauphine Island.  When we got to the Dauphine Island side of the bridge, Joyce said we had 15 minutes to catch the ferry, we pumped the tire one last time and took off to catch it.  We made it with 6 minutes to spare.  The wind was blowing and the ferry trip was a rolling experience, but pleasant.  After the ferry trip, we changed the tire out and had no further tire problems today.  The shoulder along the course was good and the traffic built steadily into Gulf Shores where we stopped for breakfast at the 41 mile mark.  I thought the trip down AL180 after breakfast was going to be difficult but DOT provided a very nice bike path.  The 12 miles to the Florida / Alabama border was pleasant and quick.  FL292 which is the same road as AL180, did not have as nice a shoulder but was adequate.  The trip into Pensacola was very good.  We stopped at the turn off to the motel, racked the bikes and enjoyed an afternoon at the pool.  A wonderful dinner was taken at Skopelos to celebrate our re-entry into Florida. Joyce here.... The ferry from Dauphin Island across Mobile Bay started running at 8:00 am and then every one and a half hour intervals.  A vote was taken last night for which ferry to catch 8:00 or 9:30, I lost.  We actually got up with an alarm clock this morning, the very first we've done.  The guys were on the road at 6:30 while I finished packing the truck, got gas, ice and a coffee.  I met them in time to pump Ern's tire and did this a couple more times before the Intercaostal Bridge.  I waited for them to start down the other side (using my binocs to see them) before starting over, just in case the tire didn't hold and I needed to pick him up.  We got to the ferry with 6 minutes to spare.  The ferry ride was almost 45 minutes and took us by several large oil rigs.  Once on the other side, my job was to find someplace for breakfast.  That didn't come until we got into Gulf Shores, 40 miles and almost 4 hours since starting the ride.  We used the stop as the switchout then Ern and I got into the holiday beach traffic.  It was a good thing there was a shoulder on AL180 because there was so much traffic and people and cars parked everywhere.  We picked up what was the closest we've come to a tailwind and made the Florida / Alabama border just after 12 noon.  After the photo shoot, we headed into Pensacola.  The Quality Inn was pretty far off course, on not too great roads, without shoulders, so we racked them and headed in.  A celebratory beer, phone calls, a dip in the pool then showers was the rest of the afternoon.  Dinner was great, the best yet.  Tomorrow's a rest day.  We'll let most of the holiday folks get home before we head back out on the roads.  Almost home! Phil here.... The alarm sounded at 5:55 am.  Ern and I lept out of bed, Joyce groused.  Once she recovered, she worked frantically to get everything in order to start the day.  Our plan was to capture as much sleep and leave just enough time to catch the 8:00 am ferry.  The plan was challenged by two events, Ernie's rear tire kept loosing air and a challenging headwind.  Fortunately, we caught the 8:00 am ferry and eagerly awaited breakfast on the other side.  There's some song about milk and honey on the other side, we didn't know the far side and how long it would take to get to breakfast.  With our belly button pressed firmly into our spine, we staggered into Big O's Seafood Restaurant for breakfast.  We had just enough energy to read the menu and gasp our order to the waitress.  Once fed, things looked up.  I changed my clothes and became the truck driver as Ernie and Joyce rode east into the heat toward the Florida state line.  I stopped at the Circle K for ice this Sunday morning at 11:35 am.  I learned Alabama has a state law that beer is not sold until noon on Sunday.  The clock in the store was set to Eastern Daylight Time so everyone could buy beer at 11:35.  There was a long line and it took a long while to buy ice.  I stopped for rocks for the grandchildren just before the state line and caught up with Ernie and Joyce as they waited for me.  The afternoon was spent reading, swimming, and telephoning.  The best part of the day was dining at Skopelos on the Bay.  Sauteed scamp on couscous, new potatoes, a delicious crawfish chowder and a fine creme brulee made this a highlight of our Adventure Cycling experience.  Tonight I'll sleep well knowing that even though I missed lunch, dinner made up for it."
173,"After sleeping in until 7:30, we had breakfast at the hotel while laundry was washing.  Ern helped me do my hair - it's red again, then we went to Best Buy for a new camera.  The bumpy roads finally did the other one in.  We stopped at Barnes & Nobles for a latte and read a couple of magazines before going back to the hotel.  The rest of the afternoon was spent relaxing and quilting.  Phil's friends Peggy and Fred Bond invited us over for dinner - the first home cooked meal since April 27 at Bill and Mary's in Phoenix.  It was great!  Peggy and Fred - thanks so much, we really enjoyed the evening! Phil here.... This day off was a lazy one.  The morning was laundry and reading followed by lunch at Smokey's BBQ.  More reading and watching a huge storm roll through Pensacola between 5:00 and 6:00 pm.  The highlight of the day was visiting Fred and Peggy and enjoying both their company and the fine dinner.  It's always fun to see good friends. Ernie here.... I tried to do as little as possible, but there were some responsibilities I couldn't shirk.  The Bond's provided a most enjoyable evening.  Good food, good company, good conversation.  They're wonderful people.  Fred and Peggy - thank you very much for your kindness and considerations."
174,"91 - too much rain the whole day, speedometers were working spoardically all day Flats so far: 22 (5 for today!) Weather: Rainy with thunderstorms Ernie here.... After a breakfast at the motel and loading up the vehicle, I had truck duty for the beginning.  I took off on a different route to hit the Wal Mart for water, and ice, gassed up the truck and headed to US90 to meet up with Phil and Joyce.  No sooner had I got to US90 and gave the riders a call when I heard that Phil had the first of his two flats.  I stayed close to riders because of the threatening weather, but no lightning this morning.  US90 was, from at least the truck standpoint, not difficult except for the Causeway to Pace which has no shoulder.  For the first time I used the emergency flashers and rode behind the riders.  Locating the Blackwater River Trail was difficult.  It's where the map says it is, but you just can't see it from the road.  After the trail there were some back local roads leading back to US90 in Holt which I spotted for Joyce and Phil.  I wish I would have had more time because there were some great looking spots to fish.  Maybe some other time.  At Holt, Joyce and I switched out and I rode with Phil.  It started raining on us again and continued for most of the rest of the afternoon.  I continued to have difficulty with the rear wheel and will not soon forget the Del Rio bicycle shop where I purchased that rim.  I think I had two flats, one on the road because of wire, and one because of the blasted extra heavy tube that Phil and I have been playing with since Carlsbad.  Phil won't play anymore, but I'm not finished yet.  It will not beat me, even if I have to cover the whole thing in patches.  After a great lunch in Crestview where I had the second flat, it started raining on us again.  We probably should have stayed for pie, but I'm still looking for custard pie.  The rain got heavy enough that we had to seek shelter and I found a steel building that blocked us from the rain.  It was raining so hard I didn't know what the building was, nor did I care.  After the rain backed off, Phil and I headed out for DeFuniak Springs.  The rest of the ride was a slow drizzle.  We had another itneresting dinner with some of Phil's working companions, Carl and Vicky Glass.  I came back to the room and supervised Joyce patching tubes and repacked the bearing in her front wheel.  Tonight, between the air conditioner and my ear plugs, I hopefully won't hear the trains at all, but the tracks are right across the road from us. Phil here.... Breakfast at the motel was sparse and I felt the ominous threat of bad weather since the forecast called for a 70% chance of rain and thunderstorms.  I also felt I would pay for my indulgences from the vineyard last night.  It's so much fun to let your cup run over when you're enjoying good times, but payback came today.  Joyce and I mounted up and rode through Pensacola to the Scenic Highway where I had flat number one for the day.  The wet road conditions caused more grit to get through the cuts in the tire and the duct tape on the inside gave out and tube abraided from the grit and failed.  Ernie changed both the tube and tire and Joyce and I started up again.  We rode about three miles to the US90 Causeway.  Traffic was heavy, the east wind blasted us in the face and thankfully Ernie kept traffic off our backs by blocking the lane.  The strong east wind made for a slow progress and hard riding.  We got through Pace and in Milton everybody who owns or could borrow an automobile was on US90.  Heavy traffic and the start of the rainfall dampened my spirtis.  The best cure I could think of was food!  My second flat was on the front wheel, but the reason was the same.  The road grit ground through the cut and penetrated the duct tape and abraided the tube.  Ernie changed both the tube and tire.  I groused about food for 2 1/2 hours and we finally ate at the Tropical Palm Restaurant in Crestview.  Butter beans, turnip greens, fried okra, fried porkchops improved my spirits.  After lunch we changed out Ernie's rear tire on the sidewalk in front of the restaurant.  Then we started eastbound on US90 in a light rain.  The light rain increased to a driving shower and I found Ernie and Joyce at a shooting range where Joyce was in the truck and Ernie was sheltered on the southside of a metal-frame building while the wind howled from the north and pushed the rain down at an angle so we were pretty well protected.  About a half hour later, the rain stopped and we took off for DeFuniak Springs.  By now all my miseries had set in and I watched the gap grow between Ernie and me.  The rain started and stayed pretty steady and we pedaled toward DeFuniak Springs.  Joyce had found us a motel.  I called my buddy Carl Glass and he and Vicky took us to Mom & Dan's Italian Restaurant for dinner.  It was good to see Carl and Vicky and we appreciate their showing us a good dining spot.  It was tube and wheel maintenance time and hopefully the newspaper wrappings will dry our wet shoes before sunup. Joyce here.... When Phil and I left the hotel, it was threatening thunderstorms.  As we came up on the US90 Causeway, it had started to rain and it was black on the other side and the wind was blowing fierce.  Once across, the wind died down, but the rain didn't.  It rained off and on all morning, sometimes even while the sun was shining.  We were in the country again today, horses, corn, beans and peanuts.  I was glad to switch with Ern today, just to be able to get out of soggy clothes.  I found a lunch spot in Crestview where the sun came out while we were eating, but started to rain hard again as we left.  This time the rain came with lightning and thunder.  I didn't ever get but 1 1/2 to 2 miles away from the guys today.  Too many flats and too much rain.  Tonight I patched all the tubes that had been pitched into the truck over the past couple of weeks.  Based on the forecast, it looks like we may need them.  My rear tire was flat by the time we got the bikes in - why is it always the rear?  Dinner was with good company again, friends of Phil, Carl and Vicky Glass.  We counted three trains since checking in, hopefully they stop running after 10:00 pm.  I was so tired last night that after Ern and Phil's journal I fell asleep.  This is actually being written as we're waiting for pancakes at Eddie's Restaurant the next morning."
175,"Joyce - 84 / 17.2   (4 hr 52Ernie - 44 / 17.6Phil - 39 / 16.4 Flats so far: 22 Weather: Mostly cloudy, rain and thunderstorms in the afternoon Joyce here.... When Ern and I went over to Ed's Restaurant for breakfast, the sun was shining.  By the time we headed out on the bikes, the storm clouds had moved in.  The ride out of DeFuniak Springs was on US90.  We actually road on it all day.  The road was great with a smooth surface, wide shoulder and rolling hills.  I think today set a record for the number of towns we went through, 13.  Some of them, however, weren't much more than semi-ghost towns.  We had a fast ride up to the switchout, where Phil and I kept up the pace into Marianna for lunch.  Ernie had found a place called Stacey's, good food and lattes.  A bad storm rolled through while we were there so we stayed put for over an hour waiting for it to move through.  With only 30 miles left for the day, Phil and I set out in rain, but at least the lightning was over.  The pace slowed down because of the rain and with about 10 miles left, the shoulder went away.  Thank goodness the rain had slacked off because the traffic picked up.  We crossed the Apalachicola River into Chattahoochee and the Eastern Time Zone.  There was a very steep climb at the end of the bridge into town.  With only one motel in town, there weren't any rooms so we racked them again and found a place on I-10 outside of Quincy.  Tomorrow morning we'll head back to where we stopped. Ernie here.... Breakfast at Eddie's was a good way to start the day.  We left DeFuniak Springs without going around Lake DeFuniak.  The course on US90 was fast, the road was good wuith enough hills to make it interesting.  I had to spend a little time this morning adjusting the rear derailler, but everything else was working well.  Phil and I switched out at the Jackson County line and since Joyce had said she was hungry, I started looking for lunch.  I found Stacey's in Marianna.  They had an espresso machine so I knew Joyce would be happy.  After lunch, Phil and Joyce decided to stay on US90 instead of going up to Blue Springs and back down to Grand Ridge (the Adventure Cycling route).  By this time it had been raining for awhile.  I started looking for motels in Chattahoochee.  The two that were listed in the Adventure Cycling map were the only two I could find.  One was full, the other had been condemned by the Health Department and wasn't open.  I think we've stayed in worse, but we're back in civilization now.  So when Joyce and Phil made it to Chattahoochee, we racked them and headed to the only motel close, a Holiday Inn Express outside of Quincy.  We were lucky here to get a room, all they had left were smoking rooms upstairs.  So I probably won't be any smarter tomorrow. Phil here.... The DeFuniak Springs Motel won't make Southern Living for awhile.  Only one train ran through the room during the night and as a memoir, I have a photo of a large display of silk flowers mounted carefully above the window air conditioner.  Just before bedtime, we were treated to a cat fight just outside our room.  After breakfast, my day started in the truck as Joyce and Ernie rolled rapidly east on US90.  I left the truck and got on the bike at the Jackson Conuty line.  Joyce and I and the thunderstorm clouds rolled into Marianna at just about the same time.  Ernie had found a good restaurant and it was a good thing because we holed up there for two hours while the thunderstorm rolled through.  After the lightning cleared Marianna, Joyce and I got on the bikes and rode east in the rain.  It's tense riding in the rain as visibility is down and the road is slippery.  We crossed the Apalachicola River into the Eastern Time Zone and we feel that much closer to home.  There was no inn with a room, so the bikes were racked directly across from the State Mental Hospital.  We made our escape from Chattachoochee, rolled east on the interstate to the Quincy exit and our home for the night."
176,"Ernie - 85 / 17.4  (4 hr 52Phil - 36 / 18.0Joyce - 50 / 17.1 Flats so far: 23 Weather: Mostly cloudy in the morning, thunderstorms in the afternoon Ernie here.... We left the motel in Quincy driving back to on US90 (the route for today) because I was curious to see what the shoulder looked like.  The ride back to Chattahoochee was uneventful and the shoulder looked good.  We prepared for the ride and changed a flat on Joyce's bike.  Phil lubed the chains because we've been in the rain the last couple of days - I'm sure they needed it.  After pictures, Phil and I took off.  Phil took the lead out of Chattahoochee and pulled for about 10 miles while setting a good pace.  The road was good and the clouds were ominous, but we stayed out of the rain.  At Quincy, we deviated from the Adventure Cycling course to find a route around Tallahassee.  I'd like to thank Cameron Cooper and Bill Copenger for their help in selecting a course.  We rode a section of the TOSRV course out of Quincy on FL12.  Bill said it would be more interesting.  By interesting I think he meant hilly, but it was a good course.  After the switchout, Joyce and I rode the rest of the Tallahassee loop and got back onto US90 with about 21 miles left to Monticello.  Mostly on shoulder, but there were some section without shoulder.  The scenery was nice with the canopied trees and the crepe mrytle planted along the roadsides.  When we got to Monticello, the storm clouds were threatening and we didn't know if we were going to make it to the motel in time.  But the rains held off until we were under the canopy at the Super 8.  Two days left. Phil here.... Today we set the alarm since it was our first day in the Eastern Time Zone.  Also, we had about a 20 mile drive back to Chattahoochee to start the ride.  Ernie and I left Chattahoochee at 8:30 and within two miles saw a trailer turned over on the roadside.  Fortunately that happened before we arrived as it would have squished us.  The road was good and I think we had a tailwind, so it was easy to keep the bikes rolling.  After 36 miles, Joyce and I switched out and I marked the route bypassing Tallahassee.  The ominous clouds postponed lunch with a goal of arriving in Monticello for lodging.  The city of Monticello does not have motels, everything has moved to the interstate five miles south.  After a short conference, I sped south on US19 followed by Joyce and Ernie.  I got a room, unloaded the gear, took my bicycle off the rack and was heading out to find Ernie and Joyce when they pulled up under the awning.  Lightning had flashed and thunder had rolled and the deluge started.  Today is our first day in Florida were we dodged the liquid sunshine.  We ate a late lunch at Wendy's, washed the soggy clothes, and Joyce updated the journal at the library.  We ate dinner at Jake's in Monticello.  We booked a room for a motel in Lake City and communicated the location to Beverly who will pass it on to Gary and Mike. Joyce here.... The alarm got us up again this morning, but I was already awake.  After a hard long ride yesterday, I didn't sleep much and I knew it was going to be tough day.  Ern and I had a quick breakfast at the motel, packed the truck and we headed back to Chattahoochee.  We parked in a small grocery store parking lot to unrack and prepare the bikes.  When I went into the store, the smell sent me way back to the past to my aunt and uncle's store.  After ice and dry paper towels (because everything in the back of the truck is now soaked) I helped Ern and Phil with the bikes.  They headed out with me close behind.  They were moving fast today so support duty was quick.  Phil and I make the switch in Cottondale.  No rain yet, clouds were building and we decided to forego lunch in Tallahassee in hopes of staying dry today.  The course on US90 was through some country, horses, cows and corn.  The part of the course through Tallahassee was canopied tree lanes and neighborhoods.  Back onto US90 we picked up a shoulder and good surfaces.  The ride was getting hard for me though by this time, sore legs, little sleep and more rolling hills.  The sky was black behind us and we could feel the air getting heavy.  We kept pushing into Monticello where we met Phil and agreed on the Super 8 first, Days Inn second then hustled through town and out on US19.  By this time the black clouds were on top of us and with still three miles to go, the lightning started with some light rain.  I was starting to bonk, but Ern kept pushing me and we got to the motel just before the bottom fell out.  We showered, started laundry and went over to Wendy's for lunch.  Phil and I left Ern to finish up the laundry while we went to the library.  I got most of the past journals in before they closed.  We had dinner at Jake's, came back, prepared for tomorrow and I poured a big glass of wine to help me relax.  I need to get some sleep tonight."
177,"Phil - 84 / 17.5   (4 hr 46Joyce - 42 / 17.0Ernie - 42 / 17.6 Flats so far: 23, but 1 new tire on Joyce's front wheel Weather: Thunderstorms in the morning, mostly cloudy in the afternoon Joyce here.... The thunder woke me this morning.  As I laid there listening for a few minutes, Ern woke up with ""Is that rain?"".  It was a storm just as bad as light night.  We slowly got ready for the ride, went to breakfast and packed the car after the storm passed.  Phil and I started out with blue skies behind us, but we rode into the backend of the storm and got wet before getting back on US90.  It didn't last very long, but by the time it ended, shoes were soggy.  We rode through North Central Florida rolling hill farm lands - cows, corn and some tobacco.  There was a wide gap between us today because the roads were too wet to draft and my quads were too sore to push the hills.  Even so, I had a good ride, keeping an 18 - 19 mph pace, except for the hills.  It was a bad night for frogs and snakes, they were scattered all over the shoulder.  At least one big snake survived though.  I thought there was a road gator in the shoulder (I'm riding without my glasses today) but when I got close, it moved it's head and flicked it's tongue.  It was a BIG black snake.  Ern and I switched out at Lee and I went ahead to check out US90 versus the Adventure Cycling course onto FL132.  US90 was better, so I waited for the guys at the turn.  Support duty was pretty easy because it wasn't very hot and they weren't stopping very often.  We had lunch in Live Oak.  I did two more stops then headed into Lake City for lodging.  After cleaning up bikes and a shower, we celebrated by splitting our last beer - a Rolling Rock.  After dinner at the the Texas Roadhouse, we made one last Wal Mart run for Powerbars and headed back to the motel to prepare for our last ride.  It looks like the Gatorade will just last.   Ernie here.... Florida switched up on us today.  Instead of raining in the afternoon, it rained in the morning.  I was lucky today as I had truck duty in the morning.  After breakfast and packing the truck, I took off for Monticello to get fuel and ice.  I went back on course to catch up with Joyce and phil.  When I stopped, they asked me where they were.  I told them they were still on course on FL158.  I'm not sure how they could've gotten lost on this road as there weren't any turn offs.  FL257 was about two miles up which was good road up to US90.  Truck duty was very easy because it was cool and wet so nobody was drinking much.  Joyce and I switched out in Lee.  US90 from Lee to Lake City was a great road - shoulder all the way.  The Suwanee was pretty, the water was tanic but not muddy.  Lunch at the Brown Lantern in Live Oak was good as usual with very good service.  The clouds started breaking up between Live Oak and Lake City so we actually had to put sunscreen on and change to sunglasses.  Once we got into the motel, we hosed off the bikes that were covered in grit and cleaned them up for the last day's ride of the trip.  I'm sure there will be major maintenance to be done once we're home.  One more day to ride. Phil here.... The storm and commercial truck drivers in the parking lot woke me this morning.  I slipped into my shoes and a shirt and went next door to the Huddle House for a hardy breakfast.  It was raining and while Ernie and Joyce ate, the rain stopped.  Joyce and I left about 8:20 and by 9:00 we were wet from the rain.  It was a cloudy day and as the rain and sweat mixed, we never got dry.  The roads were good and the ride was easy.  When we stopped in Lee, I talked to a Sysco truck driver about the discomfort of his job.  When he makes deliveries and gets wet, he has to re-enter the refrigerated part of his truck then get back in the cab and drive on down the road.  Ernie and I rode from Lee into Live Oak where we had a great lunch at the Brown Lantern.  Lynrd Skynrd and Jimmy Buffet were the musical selections.  After lunch, we applied sunscreen for the first time today, lubed the chains and mounted up for our last 24 miles into Lake City.  We hosed the grit off the bikes, and ourselves, then split the last beer three ways.  We crunched numbers from the trip to learn that we will all have ridden over 2,000 miles, over 133 hours, at an average speed of a little over 15 mph.  Tomorrow at mid-afternoon, our lifestyles will change again.  We won't be abe to eat like tenenagers, change clothing on the side of the road and our transportation will switch from two to four wheels.  We ate dinner tonight at the Texas Roadhouse where we all enjoyed ribs, sweet potatoes and good yeast rolls.  Tomorrow will end our epic journey.  We're lucky to have Mike and Gary to cover the sag duty so we can all ride into Jacksonville together.  Thanks to Beverly, Kristi and Tiffany for setting up our homecoming party."
178,"Flats by the end: 24 Weather: Mostly sunny, hot, no wind Joyce here.... It's Sunday night as I'm writing this, more than 24 hours since getting home.  Somehow it just doesn't seem real - that we were gone 7 weeks and rode just over 3,000 miles.  Saturday morning was different than the rest of our mornings.  Gary and Mike (Phil's son and son-in-law) were meeting us at the hotel at 9:00.  Mike was to be our official sag driver today so the three of us could ride the last day together.  We hadn't actually done this since our last training ride in April.  Phil was up and out first and actually headed back from the Waffle House when Ern and I pulled in the parking lot.  After breakfast we got the truck packed, bikes ready, the last of the Gatorade made up, then sat down to wait, reflect on our journey and plan the day's ride.  Gary and Mike showed up right on time.  We spent some time catching up and filling Mike in on his duties for the day, then we headed off.  The road for the day into Jacksonville (US90 for the most part) was in great shape - a good shoulder and smooth surface.  We took turns with two mile pulls and made great time getting to the end of the Baldwin trail just after 12 noon.  Some members from the bike club were there to welcome us home and ride part of the trail back.  Many thanks to Dan, Sam, Susan and David.  We took it easy for half the trail, then I started getting anxious and picked up the pace.  One mile from the end of the trail, with seven still to go to get to Phil's house, Phil had a blow out - blew the tube and sidewall of the tire out.  David stripped his tire and tube off of this front wheel so we could get going again.  Ern and Phil managed to take three tubes to get the tire fixed though and then on we went.  The rest of the ride was uneventful, but exciting to finish.  We toasted our journey's end with Beverly, Kristen, Gary, Mike and David, this time with a 1995 Dom Perigon, very tasty.  We partied for a couple hours then Ern and I headed to the house.  It was such a great feeling to be home, even though it doesn't seem like we've been gone that long.  The last four days have been tough.  We've pushed hard and rode many miles in the rain this week.  My quads are just as sore as when we were riding mountains in Arizona.  I suspect the soreness will go away - until I start back into Debbie's Power Pump classes. Ernie here.... After breakfast we got ready for the ride.  It was interesting packing up for the last time since we had done this so many times since the beginning of the ride.  We talked about the course for the day, talked with Mike and Gary about our ride and talked to Mike about sag responsibilities.  Yesterday and today have been interesting rides for me.  This is an area that I've worked in for 20 plus years and there's alot of memories along the roads.  Today we went by an area in Lake City that was an old chemical plant and I remembered all the efforts it took to get it cleaned up.  There were many other sites like this along the route that I could remember my activities over the last 20 plus years.  The road was good, the course was fast (18.6 mph average to the end of the trail) and the ride seemed to go by very quickly.  Our original plan was to come into Jacksonville and ride down the Baldwin Trail that we've spent much time on riding and training.  It was very much like a homecoming to be on that trail.  Members of the bicycle club met us and there was alot of comradarie on the ride back which was another 14 miles that seemed to pass very quickly.  We all sprinted the final hill on the trail and then Phil had his final blowout and it was spectacular! The tube was shredded and tire sidewall was gone.  David gave up his tire and walked in so Phil could finish his ride since the support turck had already headed to the house.  Joyce and I followed Phil home.  He was very much like the old fire-horse headed back to the barn.  That was also a quick seven miles.  The celebration at Phil's house was great.  Good conversation and alot of questions.  Beverly can put on a great party.  It was great to be home.  It still hasn't sunk in what we've done, or that we've done anything.  I'm still amazed at the number of people who are out there doing long distance rides and I'm starting to think about what ride I'd like to do next.  But for now, its clean up everything - the support truck, the bikes, the clothes, the equipment and try not to loose the fitness we've gained in this effort (but that will be hard to do).  If anyone out there reading this is trying to decide to do something like this, DO IT, JUST DO IT! Phil here.... Gary and Mike met us in Lake City.  Gary delivered Mike to be our SAG so we could all ride the last stage together.  Thanks.  We left Lake City and rode to the Baldwin end of the trail.  The road was smooth and wide and speed averaged 18.5 mph for that part of the trip.  At the trail Dan Zucker, his brother and Susan Snider met us and we rode liesurely down the trail and met David Stow.  David came to meet us but we arrived early and so he turned around and we all rode back to the Jacksonville end.  As we reached the two mile mark we all started a sprint to hit a 30 mph speed and David controlled the sprint.  At the one mile mark, I blew out a tire sidewall and tube.  This is the first time I've had this experience in ten years of riding.  The tire had less than 400 miles on it.  The truck was now at our home and I was 8.5 miles from the end of the 3,000+ mile trip with no tire.  David Stow took his front tire and tube off and gave them to me so I could finish.  What a friend - better than the shirt off your back.  Two valve stems failed on the repair and finally we got a tire and tube combination to work.  We started up and it was nice to have the wind cool us off.  We passed David and Susan who were walking their bikes to their cars since David had no weight bearing tire.  We rode the last 7.5 miles to our home and toasted the adventure with champagne provided by Ernie and Joyce.  Later David and Susan and about 30 other people came to the party that Beverly, Kristi and Tiffany had arranged for us.  By then we had cleaned up and this was a fun celebration.  We determined that the aggregate weight loss for the riders was 27 lbs. In reflection I want to thank those who made contributions to the Leukemia-Lymphoma Society in our behalf.  Personally, I'm pleased to have tested myself physically on this trip. My only disappointment is that the mission of raising funds for the Leukemia-Lymphoma Society fell way short of my hopes.  To date we have raised just over $2,000.  Comparing this effort to the MS 150 which all of us have done in the past - $2,000 for 6,000 total miles would not have qualified us to enter the MS 150 where the minimum is $1.00 per mile for each entrant - most people do more and the average is about three times that amount.  We met two individuals on our trip who did a fantastic fund raising one over $12,000 and another over $17,000.  My competitive nature is showing here."
179,"The weather  Generally good warm to hot settled weather through most of the summer and certainly a whole lot better then what is the norm for a British summer. A good enough reason in itself to go across the Channel. The countryside Such a wide variety of scenery from pastoral countryside to high mountains and most things in between. You are spoilt for choice.  The food (and the wine) Need we say anymore on this subject. Time and time again we have had what appear to be simple dishes which because of the herbs, sauces and the general overall quality of preparation turn out anything but ordinary. Yes, you can be dissappointed now and then but this tends to be a rarity.  The cycling Lots of lots of quiet roads to choose from with small villages and an appropriate cafe appearing at suitable intervals for that coffee break.A great appreciation of cyclists and cycling as a sport from the French public which includes the majority of French drivers(unlike their UK counterparts.  And additionally in our case.. As members of FFCT(the French Cycletourist organisation)we are collecting stamps on cards from designated places throughout France. These are called BPF(Brevet Provinces Francaise) of which their are 540 (6 in each of 90 departments). During our last trip in June we concentrated on the departments around Paris. This trip has 3 main purposes 1 - Collect stamps for the departments in Brittany and other Western France departments. We have got some of them from previous visits but we are out to complete a number of cards. 2 - Attend the yearly Semaine Federal cycling festival which this year is being held in Quimper in western Brittany for a week from August 3rd. 3 - Enjoy ourselves! Hope you enjoy the travelogue

180,"Down at the ferry terminal there were about 30 cyclists boarding for the 23:30hrs overnight sailing to Roscoff...we're off
"
181," 
We then rode down le Conquet 15kms away on the coast for a BPF stamp for the nearby lighthouse; the panoramic views and the abbey ruins. We liked this spot; very distinctive stone houses in the village, unique in France to Brittany. They reminded us of houses in western Scotland. A good number of local cyclists out today and when we got back there were other cycle tourists camped; we saw the French bearded guy again at the Semaine Federal. The lack of the sleep on the overnight ferry meant was having an effect so we were in bed by 22:00hrs; fell asleep straight away and woke up 10hrs later.

People using the netting on the nearby hammer/discus throwing area as washing lines; more people arriving; tents going up; getting more crowded. We were camped in the grounds of the town's football/athletics stadium, a short walk from the permanence. There were a number of other campsites scattered around the town as well as all forms of other accommodation. The estimate of people attending the rally was anywhere between 12,000-15,000. Down to the permanence for the evening meal at 19:30hrs; huge queues(which is normal for the first Sunday of the rally). There were feeding about 2,500 of us tonight. Only the French could do something like this and also make an excellent job of it - the food was good and hot and there was all the wine(red & rose), cider and water that you could drink. Bed and contented by 22:30hrs - looking forward to the rest of the week.
"
185," 
On leaving my tyre suddenly blew with a loud bang; replaced the inner tube; pumped it back up; it blew again, just as impressively. Found a split in the sidewall; the tyre was useless and I had no spare. Bike shop in town was shut for lunch. Luckily Mike & Sheila turned up; they had a spare with them-all sorted. More pleasant coastal scenery around the larger tourist place of Benodet. We had a short stop at another welcome place at Pleuven after 95kms before getting back to the campsite by 17:00hrs. Shower, rest and then across to the permanence for another good evening meal before returning to the campsite bar(run by local volunteers) for a late evening's chat with a whole bunch of other Brits, and a few beers as well.
"
186," 
The breeze was more helpful on the return as we returned via the larger seaside town of Douarnenez; another acceuil (welcome) place. We had a coffee/cake stop in a bar here to help us get over the hills on the final leg. Back to the campsite by 17:30hrs and then the normal evening routine of shower, rest, down to the permanence bar for a pre-evening meal beer. Evening meal, wine, cider and a wobble back to the tent!
"
187," 
Had an excellent 8.40 euros lunch in a restaurant near the permanence which we wandered around later. Jo bought some Shimano cycling sandals(I was to buy some a day later). These were to prove an excellent investment over the coming weeks; especially for me as my cherished Sidi shoes were slowly disintegrating. I dumped them(with dignity) in a bin when we left the festival. Listened to a Bretagne band whilst downing the local cider(this was becoming our favorite tipple) before going to the evening meal. Mike & Sheila went to the late evening band/dancing event with some free tickets (they returned about midnight). We were fast asleep by then.
"
188,"   
I had trouble with a slipping gear cable on the return; there were repair facilities at the permanence and the guy there replaced the cable and set it up correctly for 5 euros. Never had more bother with it for the rest of the trip. Heavy rain in the evening as we went into our cider, evening meal routine. Not a night for sitting around the campsite bar so it was straight back to the tent.
"

There were also regional and cycling club flags and a whole variety of other guises, decorated bicycles etc etc.The Brits made an effort and had their flags and a few bowler hats. Then we all slowly make our way around the town centre saying our goodbyes to the spectators by the roadside; singing songs, various instruments being blown and generally making a whole lot of noise. When that is all over the next highlight of the day is the farewell meal; all changed and into the bar and then by 13:00hrs we (2,500 of us) are all queueing up in the pouring rain. But once inside the fun starts; we didn't finish the superb meal (and all the drink) until 16:00hrs. A real noisy affair with different groups springing into song and people gnerally having a great time.And so endth another Semaine Federal(our fourth). We shall be back again next year at Aurillac in the Massif Central region.
"
192,
193," 
We found a track (part of a MTB trail) that took us across the river below the barrage and then onto minor, quiet roads which we followed back to Guemene via St Aignan. Note: France has very quickly developed (and is continuing to do so) a comprehensive system of MTB trails (or VTT: Velo Tout Terrain, as they call them here) throughout the countryside. Back at Guemene we had a welcome beer, bought some food for tea before retreating to the campsite for a shower and a rest in the shade. The washing was nice and dry.
"
194," 
The background to this is that a local labourer saw a vision of the Virgin Mary from 1623-25. The Pope visited here in 1996. Visited the supermarket in Auray to stock up on food; it' a national holiday tomorrow and we were unsure of shop opening times. Busy roads to get away from Auray. Found a nice quiet campsite near Ploemel and had the tent up and drinking a cup of tea before 17:00hrs. Two other cycle tourists there and a swiss lad on a recumbent turned up later. Dark by 22:00hrs so bedtime.
"
195," 
The only thing that spoiled it was the amount of campervans parked everywhere; there were hundreds of them. Followed the road round and into the pretty little harbour village of Pontivy. Note: Breton houses tend to have predominantly dark blue coloured window shutters as opposed to Provence ones that are light blue. After Pontivy it was the main road again and a dash back to the peace and quiet of the campsite and a bottle of local cider from the camp shop and then a relaxing time for the rest of the day. We didn't need to go anywhere as we had enough food for tea.
"
196," 
Hotter weather and we still had more ups and downs on our way to Malestroit. A French cyclist stopped to talk to us; he had spotted the Semaine Federal badges we still had attached to our bikes; he had been there as well. Followed the Brest-Nantes canal for the last few kms into Malestroit; another pretty mediaeval village and with a nice campsite nearby as well. We much preferred this place to Josselin. There was a evening concert in the village square so on a warm summer's evening we had a pleasant time drinking beers and listening to an English folk group (don't ask, we have no idea why) until late.
"
197,  
198,  
199," 
We carried on through St Brevin les Pins and onto St Pere-en-Retz and a supermarket shop for some lunch. Got chatting to a French foursome who had also been to the Semaine Federal. Keeping the badges on the bikes has proved to be a good conversation starter. We got to the pretty port of Pornic by 14:00hrs (BPF stamp for the port and chateau); had a rest by the harbour here and then a coffee before departing. Sun out now and a backwind and eventually some quiet roads as well.Huge church in the small village of St Lumine de Coulais(seemed out of all proportion to the size of the village). Got to St Philbert de Grand Lieu by 16:30hrs and although there was a campsite here we had decided that we were going to have a hotel stop tonight. We hadn't slept in a proper bed for nearly 3 weeks. Good meal of duck in the restaurant and the bed was comfy as well.   "
200," 
More quiet minor roads through Vallet and Landemont and onto Champtoceaux for good coffee stop; and a BPF stamp(for panoramic view; chateau ruins and church). There were 2 dutch girl cycle tourists here going the other way. We got into Ancenis on the banks of the Loire by 15:30hrs. Good municipal campsite. Had a wander into town later to buy some food. A cool evening. We were back in the Loire valley after only being 100kms or so further up the river in June last.
"
201,  
202,  
203," 
Decided  stop at St Varent; good small municipal site with only 2 local vans on it. An English caravanning couple turned up later who we had a good chat with. Getting dark by 21:30hrs now.
"
204," 
Some short climbs to follow but nothing too serious and we got to Parthenay by 14:00hrs. Once again in the old part we had cobbled streets; old buildings; entrance portal. We got a BPF stamp at the tourist office for all of this and directions to the municipal campsite as well. Had a beer in a bar and a visit to the supermarket for some food for tea before heading to the campsite. The campsite warden was celebrating his birthday.
"
205," 
Had our lunch back at the tent before setting off for the short journey to Colin & Jill's house(they moved to France from the UK a year ago). A very pleasant time for the rest of the day catching up with what they have been doing and how life in France was treating them. Quite a number of other Brits in the area including the owner of a cycle shop not far from our Leeds home who has a second home nearby. By the time we had drunk our pastis aperitifs; had the evening meal with wine,an after dinner brandy and chatted it was 01:00hrs in the morning. Slept like logs.

On the road towards Montbrun there were occasionally groups of people stood by the roadside then we saw police motorcyclists and then traffic being stopped or diverted. There was a cycle race due through. it turned out to be a stage of the Tour de Poitou-Charente 5 day race; a professional race. It had just started out from Montbrun; we stopped by the roadside to watch them go through and try and spot some familiar faces; one our favourite riders Andrea Tafi from Italy was at the front. We continued into Montbrun and had our lunch on a bench near the stage start which they were dismantling ready to move onto the next stage start place. After Montbrun the climbing started; we were moving into higher country now; up to 3-400 metres; lots of forested/woodland areas with scattered farms. Into the small town of Piegut-Pluviers by 15:00hrs and to the small municipal site. There was nobody else there; the warden came later to collect his money. Some clothes washing, a walk around the village, a beer and some shopping and a quiet night after the nearby dogs had stopped barking.
  "
210,  
211," 
The ride today was more up and down work but didn't feel anything like as hard as yesterday as we had no baggage this time. Had a chat with the Swiss cyclist lad who was in France for 3 months before he returned to complete his national service. There was a Dutch cycling couple at the other end of the site.
"
212," 
Charroux was our lunch stop place and another BPF stamp - for it's 11thC abbey & wooden market hall - a nice spot. Had our lunch on a bench by the tower of the ruined abbey and as soon as we vacated it a French family took it over; they must have been hiding, waiting for us to finish, they seemed to spring from nowhere. 
  
More quiet roads, but a troublesome wind at times, to Sommieres-du-Clain, the campsite here was shut, so we had a drink in the bar to consider Plan B. St Secondin 12kms away was the answer and we were there before 16:00hrs. A very quiet place, only one caravan on site and no warden appeared at all and there was no notice to advise you what to do, so it didn't cost us anything. Good job we had some food as there was only a bar in the village and it didn't serve food.
"
213,  
214," 
We then 'raced' (well it felt like it) for 25kms on a quiet easy road into Lussac-les-Chateau for our last BPF stamp of the holiday (for it's roman church, caverns, and monument).  Does the last stamp signify the end of the holiday?; the dead sunflowers we passed also seemed to be saying it's the end of the season. We took the direct route back up the Vienne valley to Sauvigny. The batteries in the torch gave up as well - it must be time to go home now.
"
215,
216," 
We just wandered slowly around; had a coffee in the sunshine; a simple lunch. Stopped off on the way back to look around the Decathlon sports outlet; bought a few bits. These stores, scattered throughout France, cover all major sports and generally offer very good value (certainly compared to UK prices). After a shower and rest we packed up and left the campsite around 19:00hrs to cycle to the coach pick up area.We had been across earlier in the day to check out exactly where it was. There were restaurants nearby so we took our time over dinner to avoid hanging around in the dark. There was another couple catching the coach (only lived 30kms from us) so we had a chat about each other's trip before the coach arrived on time. Bikes on the trailer; bodies on the coach and 18hours later we riding away for the last 20kms to home (in the pouring rain!) and the complete end to the trip.
"
217,"Weatherwise we got a bit of a mixed bag during the Semaine Federal week but then the Brittany region does tend to get more rain than the rest of France so we should have expected that to some extent. Once away from those western reaches the weather was always warmer and a lot drier. Scenically we got lots of variety, nothing as impressive as the mountainous areas or the variety that you get further south but generally pleasing to the eye. A lot of the roads and villages were new to us; that to us is one of the joys of cycling in a new area; you just don't know what is around the next corner. What we found especially interesting was the changing architecture as we moved through the different departments; from the style and construction materials used for the village houses to the very distinctive differences between the churches in the different areas.   On a coffee level (a significant factor for us) the Brittany region came out tops. We drink 'grand cremes' (large coffee and hot milk); the majority of cafes here gave us exactly that, some with the milk in a separate container. Some of the other areas were not as good and a few cafes were hopeless.Unfortunately Brittany was also the hilliest area by far; short steep ones to slowly sap your strength over the day; especially with loaded bikes. Fitnesswise; well we were both fitter but we didn't lose any weight(would like to hear from any cycle tourist who has lost weight on a trip); especially if they have been to France with all it's delicious food. Our legs were very leaden when we we got back and didn't have any zip in them; that's common if you have been lugging heavy gear around, you tend to have 'single speed' legs only. It took a few rides on our lighter bikes before we noticed any improvement.  One of the major aims of the trip was collecting more BPF stamps; we managed another 34 and completed all 6 stamps for a few more departments. We only have 84 more to get now(out of 540) so we will have to return to France again next summer.....any old excuse will do.
"
218,"Getting some early summer warm weather in. The spring weather in the UK was, as usual, not that warm or dry and after being away for 3 months tramping in New Zealand away from our winter weather we were keen to get some quality cycling miles in as well as keep our bodies warm! The other aim was to collect more BPF (Brevet des Provinces Francaises) stamps on our cards - what are these we hear you ask. Well, the FFCT (French cycle tourist organisation) run this scheme, you have to be a FFCT member to take part. The 90 French departments have 6 designated locations in each. These are either of historical, religious or tourist signifance e.g old churches, chateaux, important or picturesque villages, viewpoints, etc etc. You are required to get a stamp on a provided card for each of these sites- all 540 of them is the final aim.  We still have over a 100 to get! We were flying from our local airport to Paris(the quickest and cheapest way to get to and from France for us) and then would  be cycling in a rough circle heading in a general southerly direction first. The very nature of where the BPF places were would mean a lot of wandering about, but isn't that one of the joys of cycle touring. This stamp collecting also gives the tour a purpose as well as introducing us to yet more unique places in France. We make no apologies to the references to the football World Cup, this occupied most of the French populations minds as well as ours(well perhaps not so much Jo's). It only happens every 4years so please bear with us on this, well me really. We have a website that has travelogues of other cycling & walking trips to France, New Zealand , Nepal and a 'tourist' trip to India. If you are remotely interested than go to www.whitneys.info   "

Campsite here but we decided to carry on (big mistake). We spent the next 2+ hours trying to find somewhere as we followed the Seine valley on some busy roads; one possible place was closed  but by 17:00hrs we got to Moret-s-Loing and an excellent site just outside town. Our evening meal was a two superb pork chops and haricots verts bought earlier with some chips from the campsite takeaway. All's well that ends well."

Unfortunately no café open; at Chaon further on there was a bar/tabac but when the owner eventually paid attention to us he said he had run out of coffee(can you believe that!). No café at Pierrefitte and when we got to Souesmes further on it was lunchtime; there was no menu du jour at the local restaurant so we had a picnic lunch in the square instead. More delightful riding brought us to Nancay but the café did not open until 17:00hrs and at Vouzeron further on the café was shut on Thursdays(guess what - it was Thursday!). Eventually got our coffee at Mehun-s-Yevre and also a BPF stamp: 11-12thC  church; clock tower; chateau ruins.Cafés were open here but the municipal campsite was closed. The Tourist Office directed us to another one 10kms away and a nice quiet one it was too. A very pleasant cycling day even though we didn't get our coffees when we wanted them.    "
228," 
It was hot now and Chateauroux came at the right time. Large municipal campsite near the centre of town and time for some proper clothes washing - in a machine.  There was a local fair on which had loud dance music in the evening but everything quietened down before midnight and we had a good nights sleep."

Climbed over to Amboise in the Loire valley proper and a lunchtime meal in a recently opened Spanish restaurant (in France! and we had Spaghetti Bolognaise!). 
  
The next stop along more quiet roads was Chateau Renault for another BPF stamp: 12thC chateau and 16thC church - a lovely central part to this town on the hill . The PMU bar here was crowded out (they were all watching France against Uruguay in a crucial World Cup match) so we went into the faded bar opposite - 2 old blokes propping the bar up and the bar owner sat in his kitchen preparing his evening meal - he only came out to serve you. Rode to Montoire via Lavardin  - with a plaque outside the village saying it is one of France's prettiest villages. Well it was very nice and the chateau ruins on the hills above added to it's charm. Pitched up and settled down by 17:00hrs with a pleasant evening to relax in."
235,  
236," 
More 'houses in the rock' at Les Roches l'Eveque and then a climb out of the valley and some ups and downs onto Epuisay and our coffee stop. Two little sisters running around the bar laughing and playing; the older one sat on a bar stool next to a bloke with his bum  hanging out of his jeans; the younger cheeky one noticed the bloke's bum and started to point and hold her other hand to her mouth and was sorely tempted to give his bum a nudge - get the picture. The little girl had such a mischievous look on her face. We were doubled up; Jo had to go hide in the toilet to avoid collapsing. There were some good long distance views as we continued to Mondoubleau for a BPF stamp: sloping tower ruins. An excellent lunch at the Hotel de la Gare just outside town - perhaps a bit too much food; the menu also included wine so the first few hills after were hard work - the legs felt a bit wobbly. The hills continued through Montmirail: BPF stamp for chateau and the panoramic view and then onto Authon-en-Perche; bought some food first in the village as the campsite was 1km outside. Some noise from the nearby motorway but we quickly forget that and sleep was no problem."
237," 
This place is twinned with Coniston in the English Lake District - the connection being Marcel Proust and John Ruskin. Had our picnic lunch on a stone bench by the church at Meslay-le-Grenet; saw a sign here saying:  100metres - 15thC murals and 'danse macabre' but could we find  them, could we heckers like; there was no another sign at all. Heavy rain cloud as we approached Chartres, but luckily it missed us - just!. We splashed through the remaining pools of water later on. Two other cycle tourists coming the other way; they were going to find it tough into the headwind that had been our  tailwind. Into Chartres and the campsite by early afternoon; pitched the tent and after a wash had a walk into town and a look around the very, very impressive Chartres cathedral (we have been here before many years ago, but it still impressed us). Started to rain, dived into a bar and later dived into a restaurant for some food - but just an average meal unfortunately. Sometimes that can be the case in a 'tourist' area. Back to the tent and more rain by 20:30hrs."
238," 
More valley riding down to Gallardon(this time the Voise valley) and another BPF stamp: chateau,church, and old houses. More tailwind riding across open farmland and then an increasingly busy road into Rambouillet  and a large campsite 2kms outside on the edge of Rambouillet forest by a lake: a pretty location. Supposed to be 50kms of cycle paths around here. Jo's stomach still not so good  so we rested the remainder of the  afternoon in pleasant warm sunny weather."
239," Took the direct route back to Rambouillet, one particularly pretty wooded section near Cernay.  A beer at the campsite on my return; we returned to the campsite restaurant  in the evening for a pizza  - Jo was feeling better."

Needed a bar now for a Perrier but couldn't find one. Into Henonville by 14:00hrs which according to our details had a campsite but it needed any enquiry at the local garage to find it. Naturally, it was at the top of a hill! Nice chateau in Henonville. Stifling  heat so we didn't move much for the rest of day and we had enough food and some wine for our evening meal, so we didn't have to! Sometimes just resting and relaxing can be so enjoyable."
246," 
There was one bumpy cobbled road section here which we walked. Quieter roads brought us to Senlis and with it being the last night we wanted a hotel, but unfortunately the three we tried were full and the 4th did not open until 18:00hrs so we went to the Tourist Office and they found us an excellent chambres d'hote place. Had a walk around the old part of town later, cobbled streets, cathedral and some other interesting buildings. Returned later for our evening meal."

250,"Considering we hadn't been cycling for any great distance for over 4months(we had been away in New Zealand tramping for 3 months)we were pleasantly surprised by our overall fitness. We just made a point especially early on of taking it easy (apart from the 3rd day that is), just building the miles up. We also had not been cycling with fully loaded panniers with full camping gear since our cycle trip to NZ in 1999! Not bad eh, for a couple in their mid 50's The scenery although not the grandeur of the Alps or the wide open spaces of the Massif Central(one of our favorite areas) was pleasant enough and quite varied, although predominently arable farmland and forested areas. The joy though is following the minor roads(where ever possible) and going through small villages, seeing the different variety of houses through the regions,the numerous chateaux(and not just in the Loire), meeting the people,lunchtime meals, bar stops etc etc.   The aim of collecting more BPF stamps was successful- we got an additional 37 and completed a number of departments in this area.  Next trip to France leaves on the 31st July, we are initially off to the Semaine Federal cycle festival at Quimper in Brittany for a week and then continuing our collection of BPF stamps throughout Brittany and then further south. We will probably be other there for 5-7weeks. There may well be another report to follow."
251,"Well why not! We have a strong desire to be well away from a British winter; this is becoming a regular habit after my early retirement from work over 5 years ago. Also my birthday is in February and I have a personal ambition never to have a  birthday in a cold wet winter again. New Zealand has been our destination for three years out of the last 4  - the first time cycling and the last two spending a lot of time tramping their various tracks. We fancied a change (even though we really do love New Zealand) and we could combine this  trip with visits to see some friends in Canberra and Sydney. It's seems a nice place as well! WHERE & WHEN TO GO? Entirely dictated by the weather. An Australian summer can be very hot indeed especially in the northern half; it's also their rainy season there from Oct to April -  so that was out. We fancied Victoria and Tasmania initially and then the idea expanded to include Perth and Western Australia particularly if we went there in springtime and then the thought of combining the two came about. So that was it then, oh and while we are about it why not carry on through Canberra to Sydney to complete the full crossing. A simple enough idea but perhaps not so simple to complete  - this was quite a serious undertaking.  It needed some further thought and investigation and possibly a check with our doctor to see whether we had lost our marbles! Our son & daughter have long accepted that we are getting dafter the older we get. CYCLING ALL THE TIME? No way! This is a 6 month trip to Australia not a 6 month day after day cycling journey. The bikes are essentially a means of getting around. After the section from Perth to Melbourne we will take things easy for a while seeing the sights before undertaking some shorter trips in Victoria state. The next major cycling section will be around Tasmania but as we intend to be there for up to 6 weeks or so we will not be cycling everyday (it is not a big island!). Probably some more easy days after that before we head up to Canberra for some time with friends there. The next leg will be to Sydney to see more friends before we depart for home. The cycling throughout (after Melbourne) will be dictated by the weather (too hot or too wet will mean little cycling) and also by where we are (if it is particularly interesting place then we may stop for a few days). We will probably do some walking as well (especially in Tasmania). The only critical cycling rule is that we really do want to see if we can cycle the whole way from Perth to Sydney; so no use of other modes of transport on that route but we may well use other transport for some side trips.
"
252,"Plenty of searching on the internet gave us a lot of background information; we found lots of useful sites. The following are some examples: www.westernaustralia.net - Western Australia Tourism
www.tourism.sa.gov.au - South Australian Tourism
www.visitvictoria.com - Victoria Tourism
www.discovertasmania.com.au - Tasmania Tourism In addition there are a good number of touring cyclist forum sites that have travelogues of various trips undertaken by other cyclists .just go searching. Then we came across a guy (Collis Ivey) in Victoria who organises small supported cycle group crossings of Oz twice a year, first from Melbourne to Perth and then he does the return journey. He operates under the name of 'Cycleacrossoz'; see www.cycleacrossoz.com.au. We got in touch; he set us some info; it looked good. It also meant we could travel light and as we would be carrying our baggage for the following 4-5 months that seemed like a nice start. The Perth start date was ideal for us (26th Oct 2002); arriving in Melbourne 1st Dec. We could then spend Dec/Jan and most of Feb in Victoria and Tasmania before heading up to Sydney through late Feb/March, avoiding the real heat of the summer,  returning to the UK by early April in time for our springtime.  GETTING SORTED We confirmed the trip with Collis in early September and sent him the money. We got our flights booked using Singapore airlines with a day stopover in Singapore; arriving in Perth on Oct 22nd. We applied for 6 month Australian visas; disappointed with them costing £50 each. You can stay in NZ for 6 months for nothing!  Bike preparation was minimal; we had just returned from 5 weeks cycle camping in France; changed some cables; bought some new tyres and just checked them over. The camping gear was all ok. Treated ourselves to some new clothes. Anything else could wait until we got there.  We booked accommodation at  Perth YHA via the internet for the 4 nights prior to the ride starting.  GEAR LIST Basically take as little as possible; the number of other cyclists we have met who have returned baggage home after spending a few days cycling and realising that they are overloaded. The older you get the more weight becomes an issue - so we are having a major pruning exercise going through all the kit we took on our last 2 French trips. Not going to publish a full detailed gear list here; every cyclist has their own idea and personal requirements. We personally can't believe the amount of gear some people take but then they are generally a lot younger than we are so perhaps weight is not such an issue for them. We have some friends, older than us, who take less luggage than us; perhaps the rule is ...take less the older you get! To give you an overall idea of what we take: I will have: 2 small front panniers holding: 2 x ¾ Thermorest sleeping mats; 2 washbags & 2 microfibre towels; 2 small lightweight umbrellas (very useful as sunshades as well as shelter from rain) and perhaps a couple of other light items. 2 large rear panniers holding 1 compact lightweight sleeping bag & inner;Trangia cooking stove/pans etc; my clothes and with some room to spare.  1 barbag for essential daily items.  The tent will strap onto the top of my rear pannier. Jo will take 2 large rear panniers for her sleeping bag and clothes (each of which will be about 2/3rds full); this leaves space for any food etc that we buy on route. Jo will also have a barbag for her essential daily stuff. Any other bits and pieces go into the pannier pockets.    SOME THINGS WE DO Take sleeping bag inners; far easier to wash these out every week or so than to try keep a sleeping bag clean; they also provide extra warmth when it cools down as our bags are only summer lightweight ones. If it gets hotter then we just sleep in the inners, using the bags(they have full zips) as a cover if needed. Use lightweight head torches for after dark; they are also useful as emergency  bike lights if we get stuck. All clothes/sleeping bags are wrapped in plastic bags inside our panniers; in addition we have some rip-stop nylon pannier covers Jo made: it's just extra protection, even though our panniers are waterproof; last thing you want is damp clothes or bag.  Take a pack of 'UNO' cards and have a journey length competition; this can get quite heated at times and the running totals get into the thousands! We are also considering taking a small radio with us for the Oz trip. All clothing taken has to meet the lightweight; compact and quick drying criteria, adding and taking off thin layers as the weather changes. Take bare essentials as we can always buy some more stuff over there. Make sure all inner tubes are new before we go; especially for hot countries as patches on repaired tubes can 'lift' on hot roads.  We are cycling in Shimano cycling sandals using spd pedals. They are excellent for warm climates; we used them throughout our last French trip, equally useful for walking around in. They keep your feet nice and cool; if it gets cold we just put some socks on or our goretex socks as well if it is wet and cold. For Australia though if it gets too hot we may well be putting socks on to avoid sunburn!  Take some plastic ties and some duck tape. Extremely useful if anything starts to fall apart. We held a pannier rack together with a few plastic ties on our French trip in June. We also take an extra couple of straps for tying any extra luggage onto the panniers For a bit of luxury we take 2 folding 'seats' that the thermorests fit inside and allow us to sit upright, though on the ground; we just don't fancy lounging around on elbows etc trying to get to comfortable. Is that just our age? For a bit of security we list all important information(passport numbers; visa card numbers and contact telephone numbers etc etc ) on a word document. We then send a copy to our hotmail address for easy accessibility if we have any problems.We also photocopy important documents and keep a copy in a plastic folder in the bottom of a pannier."
253,"Not really, our daughter still lives there, so the house will be well looked after. She is looking forward to having the place to herself for 6 months! GETTING THERE & BACK WITH BIKES? Could be. Singapore Airlines wanted the bikes packed or bagged. We have bike bags but coming back from a different airport poses problems. The bags are too heavy/big to carry on the bikes whilst touring. One option would be get some cardboard boxes from our local bike shop; leave them at Perth then try and get some more in Sydney; or use large plastic bags (sometimes airlines supply these). The other option brought up was to use our bike bags and then post them from Perth to our friends in Sydney. We may well do that.     IN AUSTRALIA?  Well for the supported leg from Perth to Melbourne there are some long cycling daily distances involved; we would be doing about 3,700kms in 36 days with a number of 150+kms a day. There would be rest days though and we have ridden these sort of distances in France and at home without baggage. It would be the daily accumulation that may be an issue. The terrain is generally of easy gradients though; many flattish days especially crossing the Nullabor desert- the major challenge of the trip. The only issues we could see would be the weather (if it got too hot or if we had strong headwinds or really bad weather). But you can't not do something because of some possibility of something adverse happening can you?. We are in our mid-fifties, if we don't give it our best shot now we may well regret it in the future. Read the following on somebodies travelogue ..'It's best to regret doing something then regret not doing something' Apologies to the author for not remembering your name.  Anyway in the main this trip is meant be a challenge and an adventure not a holiday (though there will be times when we will be having a holiday)- let's treat it as such.

Took the picture with our new digital camera - here's hoping we can get more pictures on the site. The other large black pannier (with the stuff we will need for the Singapore stopover) we will carry on board together with our bar bags and helmets. We are stopping over in Singapore for 1 night on Mon Oct 21st after arriving there about 09:00hrs; we will depart for Perth at 08:30hrs on the 22nd. We will leave the 2 bike bags and 2 panniers at the left luggage place at the airport overnight. When we get to Perth we will post the 2 bike bags to our friends in Sydney to use for the return trip home on March 31st.The time is now 14:00hrs on Sat Oct 19th; must sign-off as there is more work to do. We have also been invited out tonight to some nearby friends for drinks;our mutual friends from France who we stayed at in August are over visiting. The only problem is we must leave early as we have to be up by 04:30hrs tomorrow for the taxi to take us to Manchester Airport for the flight.

258,"A cooler, breezier day with temps in the mid 20's. Spent the morning assembling the bikes - no damage detected from their long travels. Locked them up in the shed and walked into town centre  (only 5mins away). Wandered around the shops and malls spending money; we still needed some gear  - Jo bought a UV protection 'daft' hat (hopefully we can get the picture of it uploaded sometime); a UV protection cycling  tee shirt for me and a neck cooler; 30 protection suncream as well.They are very big here on UV protection.The best selection of gear was from the Wellington Surplus Stores on Wellington street appropriately enough - they had everything and good value as well. We also bought 2 face netting masks for $5 each - had been recommended to us to stop the flies getting in your face when they are bad out in the bush. Went into a local bike shop and the lad in there was from Clitheroe (50kms from us); we recognised his Lancashire accent straight away. We completely forgot to buy some food for tea so we went out to a different Italian pasta place.I ate far too much and lasted nearly all the next day on it.
   24/10 Another lovely breezy and warm to hot day. Spent the first hour or so wandering back and forth from the Post Office opposite the hostel. Packed up our bike bags and packing and posted them off in 2 boxes to Sydney - cost about $40.Hopefully there will there when we arrive in 5 months. Walked back into town and down to the Swan River; then caught a free bus over to Kings Park  -a huge park area on the hill overlooking Perth City and the river; botanical  gardens; lovely views and enough to interest us for an hour or so. Walked back into town for that necessary and late food shopping. We tried to get some meths for our stove; the guy at Woolworths that they aren't allowed to sell it in the city centre(the local drunks get hold of it) but he said you can get it in the
suburbs (work that one out!) Back to the hostel for some rest and later another well earned beer in the Brass Monkey before we ate in at the hostel - cooked the pasta ourselves this time.   "
259," 
Jeff and us caught the train back into Perth; the others were stopping down near Freemantle. Do you know what the 'Freemantle Doctor' is?  - well it is the cool afternoon sea breeze that blows in; cools you down from the hot winds that blow from the east - so now you know. Having problems finding an internet cafe that can upload pictures; this doesn't bode well for the rest of the trip. Lots of things happening in Perth as we prepare to leave; it's the Gay/Lesbian parade on saturday night; it's the World Rally Car championship round on 31st Oct and the English cricket team are playing in the area. But we have other things to do - wish us luck as we depart from the Bell Tower by the Swan River at 08:30hrs tomorrow.

Lots of silver/red birds squarking around the roadside trees - think they are called 'galahs'. Occassional road signs saying 'road subject to flooding' - not imaginable. The forecast for our finish today was 37'C and that's on a cloudy day but just as we were getting fed up of the wind, it shifted to the W/SW during our lunch stop at Cunderdin and a lot cooler and with a few spits of rain - it felt like home. The result - we blew along the last 60kms in 2+hrs. Meredin was a smallish railside town; pop 3,000. Collis again suggested eating out; so off most of us went to a good value Chinese Restaurant. The various Road Trains and Freight Trains only briefly disturbed us during the night. Jo found a friend today at the campsite; Billy the friendly white tailed karilla climbed onto her shoulder; think it was just to have it's photograph taken.   "

  No live kangaroos seen today, lots of dead ones and one that was dressed up in a skirt and a hat and propped up against a tree - honest, we are not kidding. There were 2 dead camels which we missed. Other than that it was just a question of clocking the kms up to get to our bush camp by late afternoon. Collis cooked Sphagetti Bolognaise on the bush fire - and very good it was too. A lovely end to the evening when the sun went down.   "
270,   After Balladonia the sign came up: 'Start of Australia's longest straightest road 146'5kms' It's so straight the illusion is that you are going uphill when all that is occurring is the road is reaching to the horizon. One section of the road is a runway for the Flying Doctor Service. Another Bush Camp 100 metres or so off the road and not too many flies tonight and Collis came up with another excellent meal; and so to bed when it went dark.

  Passed a water tank and shelter where they were a dozen emu's getting sips of water from the dripping tap.    This water can't be relied upon for human consumption without boiling it first. Finished the longest straightest road - hadn't seemed that bad. Just before Caiguna there was a blowhole out of the limestone ground  - you dangled your feet over the edge and cold air blow up cooling you down - absolutely fantastic as it was very hot by this time. Bye the way: I drew the winning horse Media Puzzle from our sweepstake and won 30dollars.   "

273,"  A complete change weatherwise (good job) with cool SE winds off the sea but hitting us on our right shoulders allday long to make us work for the distance. Practically flat roads all day with the Hamilton Tablelands escarpment to our left and the sea away to our right. No shelter from the wind; we just kept on grinding the kms away.    It was getting to early eveing when we got near Eucla and there were lots of Kangaroos out and also Emu's. We can understand why they get killed as one Emu just sauntered slowly across the road, stopping in the middle briefly on the way. They have not roadsense whatsoever! Eucla sits on top of a hill just to make the finish hard. The clocks have moved forward 45mins. A nice stop overlooking the sea and we had a couple of beers and a meal for Jo's birthday - she deserved it!   "
274,"  A difficult wind at times for the next 45 kms across open scrubland with the sea about 500 metres away to our right at the bottom of the 100 metre high impressive Bunda Ciffs. There were a number of access points where you could get a better view down to the crashing waves. Further along we saw a group of camels against the skyline near the edge of the cliffs; the exceptionally dry weather has driven them further south away from the outback.    Bush Camp by 17:00hrs; another excellent meal cooked by Collis over a bush fire and a beautiful sunset to finish the day - and we are now back on schedule.
"
275,"  We were totally dependant on the van support today as there are no other facilities until the Nullaboor roadhouse sitting in the literally the middle of nowhere. The Nullaboor (means treeless plain) is a very desolate place - it's 450mls from W to E and 200 mls from S to N and is 77,000 sq miles with only 8 inches of a rain a year. PAck of wild dogs around the roadhouse (but actually very timid) with 'Bertie' being something of the roadhouse pet, sitting outside the front door. The wind really picked up just before we arrived and putting the tents up was something of a challenge. The meals in the roadhouse were good though and we had another nice sunset.   "
276,  The happiness was shortlived though as the roads became hillier though bush with some quite steep sections. Again no other facilities apart from roadhouses; Yalata Roadhouse reached after 90kms and some welcome cold drinks. Some strengthening headwinds after here slowed us down considerable and we didn't reach Nundroo Roadhouse until nearly 18:00hrs and then we had the grumpy owner to contend with. This place is a bit run down and he is well known in the area and with other travellers across the Nullaboor. We managed to get a meal out of him (he said we should have warned him we were coming) and his assistant (who was much friendlier and a good cook). Some wear and tear happening in the party today - Tony got in the van at Yalata; Geoff (with his sore bum) got in after 40kms and Robert didn't ride all day because of his sore bum.Gregg came in very tired later on. Jo told them if they didn't have a full day's rest at Eucla this is what would happen and do you know what she is right(as usual!)

282,  We were rewarded in the second part of the day with some lengthy gradual downhills and some flat as well and also the winds eased down. Saw an Emu by the roadside. Everybody a little bit tired at the end of the day but really looking forward to tomorrow  - - rest day!!!!

285,"  More prosperous looking townships and properties; had our lunchtime at Clare the biggest place hereabouts where a girl from the toruist office came out quizzing us about our trip and then provided us with a free bottle of the local wine - don't know how we going to share that out amongst the 11 of us.Had a very english cup of tea with scones and jam in an antiques shop/cafe at Tralee.Roads gradually getting busier now as we get nearer to the Adelaide area; everybody seems to be driving about 10kph faster; in  arush to get no where in particular and occassionally coming rather close to us when there was traffic coming the other way - the roads did not have any hard shoulder. It was a bit of a shock to the system after 3 weeks and more of very friendly and courteous drivers. We went with Woody to an Indian Restaurant in the evening; just for a change from the normal Aussie pub meal. Just a word of cheap meals - there are lots of places that on certain nights of the week provide 'all you eat' meals for a cherap price. It's just a question of asking at the tourist information place or at the campsite; we have stuffed ourselves for 8$A on occassions; Working Men's Clubs; Golf Clubs, Pubs  etc You usually get a main course and as much salad and veggies you can stuff inside you - we need those calories !! When we got back into the tent it started to rain; but only lightly for a few hours.   "
286,  At our lunchstop at Palmer about 100+ motorbikers with a lead stretch limo and police escort went past - they were off to scatter a friends ashes on some nearby hills - there were all members of a Vietnam Veterans club. It was a real struggle after lunch over smaller hills but straight into a headwind -  along 33kms into Murray Bridge - by the River Murray funnily enough - the largest river in Australia. Oh and just to remind us of home we saw road signs today pointing to Harrogate; Blyth and Stockport!   
287,    
288," 
Traffic was reasonable and there was a bit of a hard shoulder to ride on. At first some gentle hills and then flatter across the salt plains and a particularly pretty salt lake called the Pink Lake - and it was Pink. Two Japanese cycle tourists coming the other way; they had started in Darwin and intended to cycle the whole way around Australia; good luck to them as they will be crossing the Nullaboor in the summer season - it will get very hot there. Got to Meningie after lunch and quite a pretty place it was too sitting by Lake Albert with lots of Pelicans around the shore line (what do you call a group of pelicans?  -  a 'crossing of' perhaps). Went to the local school/library where you can get intenet access for free. Down to the local pub again for our evening meal and another special deal. They had a great idea in the bar where they had a wooden wheel divided into different coloured segments. Every 10mins somebody spins the wheel and the colour that the pointer lands on shows what special drinks offer is on - e.g 2 for 1 or 1$ off certain beers etc. There are 2 black segments which means full price. It's a good deal for the pub and everybody drinks that much quicker to get the next special deal!   "

294,29/11 The sightseeing tourist day Lots to see and do in Mt Gambier; cool and cloudy to start with but becoming sunnier and warmer as the day went on. Went to library to update website (free there) and then back to Jonties internet cafe to get some more pictures uploaded. After lunch rode up to the Blue Lake (only 2kms away); old volcanic crater with a lake in it that changes colour twice a year; goes from winter grey to blue for the summer and then back to grey in autumn. There is another lake called Valley Lake which is it's poor cousin; it doesn't change colour at all! Quite a picturesque area. Facts: the lake has an average depth of 70 metres; volume of 36 million litres. Area also famous for it's limestone sinkholes; the best one is called the Umpherston Sinkhole which you can walk down into; it's done out like a Victorian Garden. English motorcycling couple on the campsite who have spent 15months riding overland to Australia and broke down 15kms out of town. Their part has to come from the UK and they are stuck here for 10days waiting for it! Another cold BBQ evening; we ate in the tent for warmth!   
295,    
296,"  2/12 Warrnambool Rest Day; The hot and cold day We decided to have a rest after yesterday; the winds switched yet again, this time to the NE which meant warm to hot weather; up to the high 20's, until about 14:00hrs that is. Whilst lazing by the swimming pool a big gust of wind got up (no, not us) and it shifted suddenly to a cooler SWesterly  and the temps dropped nearly 10 degrees; apparently this is quite a common occurence. Before all of this we had wander around the town itself; nothing of partticular interest in the town; it is more noted for it's splendid beaches and coastline. Interesting fact; in the 1880's Warrnambool Port handled more cargo than Melbourne - so now you know. Later on we had a look around the nearby Flagstaff Hill Maritime Museum - an open replica of a small late 19thC fishing port with historical buildings built around a small wharf area with boats etc. A really worthwhile hour plus spent there. Had another BBQ but this time undercover and fully sheltered from the cool wind.
"
297,      
298,"A cool to cold windy start and just as we were debating whether to go or not the rain set in and the wind strengthened.Went to the Info centre to check on the weather prospects (not good at all). Went for a coffee and  then nipped into a couple of shops (including a small exhibition of shipwrecks in the Pharmacy of all places). Went back to the shelter of the campsite TV room; the seas looked rough as we ran/walked by the bay. Watch a French film with subtitles on TV  - that seemed unreal. Met another cycle tourist; Mark from Esperance in WA who had decided to call it a day after 20kms - he was wet through. He had been on the road 2 months riding across the Nullaboor and unlike us he had had some terrific tailwinds; averaging 30kph on one day.He is planning to go to Tasmania as well. The rain eased off in the afternoon but the wind did not. There was a total eclipse of the sun today at Ceduna - remember that place; we passed through there on 13/11. Temps never got above 15-18'C today and the wind made it feel a lot colder.    05/12 Rain on and off through the night and the winds got stronger and it got colder. Is this really Australia?? We had our gortex jackets on all day and thermal underwear as well. We have been warmer on the West Coast of Scotland in bad weather. Squally heavy showers most of the day but it was the wind that made it too dangerous to ride the bikes. Mark was staying put as place; he had booked into a cabin yesterday; not bothering with the tent in this wind. The sea looked awesome when we had a short walk to the headland. After the buffeting the tent had taken overnight (it had stood up well) we moved it into an opened ended shelter. Gary (from Fairbanks,Alaska) turned up and said it had been a bit of a 'white-knuckle ride' to get here. We had last seen him at Kingston when we left the group.     06/12 The wind and rain eased off a little but it really was still a bit too gusty to go along what would be an exposed route and also we would not get the good views that the next section is famous for. It brightened up and warmed up in the afternoon but basically we did very little today.Mark was leaving us today; he works in the Goldmines and had received an offer of 2 months work in South Africa; he was busing it to Melbourne, leaving his bike there, flying to Sth Africa and returning after 2 months to complete his ride. Gary was sitting it out today as well. That's the beauty of lengthy bike tours; there is no rush to go anywhere apart from Sydney by 31st March 2003 that is. While we sat and froze Sydney waas experiencing 35'+C and bush fires. We could have done with a fire here!   "
299,

301,"   Busier holiday place at Lorne where we stopped to eat and then further along the traffic increased but we had a good hard shoulder to ride along to get to Anglesea.Just great scenery all the way, pity about the weather.Before we got to Anglesea we passed under the wooden archway that signifies the offical start of the road. At the campsite at Anglesea Gary was already there and an American couple on a tandem with a trailer, going the other way, had just turned up.They were going to find it hard work into the wind over the coming days.   "
302,11th Dec  We had decided to have a days rest and a good look around Queenscliff. More weather like before and particularly windy today. Had a tour of Fort Queenscliff(Australia's largest and best preserved military fortress) with a guy who has 7 generations of family going back here. More facts: this place was originally started in 1838 and is the base for the ship pilot operations who guide the ships through The Rip (a 3 kilometre wide channel at the entrance to Port Phillip Bay and Melbourne. The actual width for large ships is only 250metres and this strech of water is one of the most dangerous in the world. Port Phillip Bay is over 600 sq miles and it is 100 kilometres by road to Melbourne from Sorrento across the channel - our intended route for tomorrow after catching the ferry.   
303,  
304,Sat Dec 14th The Melbourne Sightseeing Day A lovely hot summer's day and we spent 8hrs of it (something of a record for us) looking around Melbourne. A 30mins train ride from Collis's (8$40 bought a day ticket which we could use on other transport in the city). Into the centre by 11:00hrs; went to the very large Victorian Market and the noisy meat and fish section with all the traders shouting that they had the best bargains. Caught a tram across the river and wandered the picturesque Botanical Gardens. Families and groups having picnics; wandered back into the centre through the park and down the south bank of the River Yarra by all the up market cafes and restaurants. We even spent some money on new clothes(well Jo did) before having a ride on Santa's Tram around the centre; no sign of him though. Everybody out Xmas shopping(apart from us); kids in tow; carrying various bags of goodies.We also found an internet place that could upload our picture but unfortunately we had the cable for the camera back at Collis's - idiots. Had a bite to eat before catching a late train back to Collis's. A very pleasant place is Melbourne - we enjoyed it.Tomorrow we are moving on inland on a new part of this journey.   
305,
306,"   16th Dec Mon The all dressed up and going nowhere day Our good intentions to get away before 08:00hrs to avoid the heat of the day worked and we were heading through town when my back wheel started to wobble. To cut a long story short it was shot! Had a coffee and waited for the bike shops to open(there were 4 of them in town).All very helpful but nobody could either fix the wheel or provide a new good quality one though they did try their best; even phoning contacts in Melbourne. Final result was one shop could get a rim from Brisbane in Queensland(hundreds of miles away) air-freighted down and they would build a wheel up for me either tomorrow or the day after - watch this space! So we found a campsite nearer to town, put the tent back up, had some lunch and later on walked back into town and left my rear wheel with them. For you who have been following earlier stories this is the wheel I got in France to replace my trusted Mavic wheel which finally split the rim there. For those of you back home  -  please remind me before our next trip to get another good pair of touring wheels built up! So we have a day or more of sightseeing to do now but Ballarat looks a good place to do it. 17th Dec Tues The Hot day in the Goldfields day Phew! a hot day, from the minute the sun hit the tent at 08:00hrs we knew we were in for a hot one - it got to 39'C. We spent about 6hrs in the nearby Goldfields Sovereign Hill outdoor museum or really more of a historical park. Buildings and mines replicating the heyday of the goldfields in the 1850's. A superb place, very authentic looking; people in periodic costume wandering around; in shops and work areas. There were 2 stagecoachs going around; 2 underground mines with tours; goldpanning; shops selling goods of the period(but with modern day prices); dusty streets and sidewalks; hotels serving meals, drinks; a theatre with a regular vaudeville act on throughout the day; travelling salesman; blacksmiths; gold smelting; photographic studio (where you could get a photo in period dress); over 30 buildings you could wander around; various demonstrations etc etc. We throughly enjoyed it - the best museum of this type we have ever been to; you could easily spend another day there. It was just so hot today so we struggled back to the campsite where there were bodies in and around the swimming pool and other bodies in various stages of collapse in the shade around the campsite. Phoned the bike shop; the wheel was nearly ready; decided to leave that for tomorrow - we weren't going any further today! It was that sort of evening when the slightest exertion made the sweat run down your face and off your chin.    18th Dec Weds The it never rains but it pours day Figuratively speaking that is as it was another hot day but only mid 30's(so that's all right then). Overnight we had a disaster as we woke up to 2 broken tent poles; no idea why as we had had no wind. The tent was finally giving up the ghost (we bought it in NZ Jan 1999). We worked out that we must have slept in it for nearly a year since then. The zips were also starting go; sometimes you didn't know whether you were going to be able to get in or out without a struggle. The decision was made: buy a new one. Luckily in town at the Snowgum shop they had a sale on of one particular tent (100$ off)which filled the bill; good quality and lightweight - the deal was done. Next round to collect that wheel - another deal was done. We thought while we have the plastic card out of it's wallet why not book the ferry to Tasmania - yet another deal was done. Plastic card was put away (hopefully for some time).Must put a word in for John and his mates at Cycle City, Ballarat; nobody else could help us but they could get a rim air-freighted down from Brisbane and build a quality wheel in 24hrs. Good on yer mates; top marks for service! So with our new goods and some food shopping (and with a bottle of wine to celebrate spending so much money) we retreated back to the campsite; the swimming pool, the spa and later inside the new tent; and very lovely it looks to.

308,"  21/10/2002 Maldon 0kms The explosion at the swimming pool day A hot to extremely hot day with temps forecast to reach 40'C so guess where we cycled to today - that's right; absolutely nowhere - we invoked the new supplementary rule. Had a lie in until the sun hit the tent at 08:00hrs and then we had to move; it was getting hot already.Kept moving the tent around to find shade during the day; dead easy with this new one.Other than that we wandered down into the town and a leisurely browse around the shops; bought two secondhand books to read and wandered slowly back up the hill to the camspite for lunch.Then we hardly moved for 4 hrs; it was just too much effort.We thought about going to the local swimming pool 200 metres away but couldn't summon up the energy!The BBQ chef rebelled and wasn't cooking over a hot barbie in this weather so we adjourned to the local pub for 2 beers and a meal later on. Whilst there the sirens went off for the volunteer firemen; thought no more about it. When we walked back past the swimming pool later; they were there in all their protective gear. Apparently the lifeguard (in his protective clothing) had be mixing some chemicals for the filtration system and they had started to combust.The fireman were dowsing things down and throwing stuff into the swimming pool;there will be no swimming tomorrow, the pool will have to be drained. Some info: Maldon is Australia's '1st Notable Town' declared by the National Trust in 1996. Original frontages and buildings from the goldmining days; no particular special buildings it's charm is the overall layout of residential, commercial and mining and the detail within the structures.A lovely spot. Mt Tarrangower nearby at 571 metres is the geographical centre of Victoria - so there!   "
309,"  Called in at the Info centre before heading due north(so the wind was directly behind us) into the 'Golden Triangle' and Donolly. Called this because this area has produced more gold nuggets over time than anywhere else in Australia and also the worlds biggest at 65 kilograms in 1869 (called the Welcome Nugget). Individuals still go goldmining; in November a guy found a nugget valued at 60,000$ - could be a good way to finace this trip! Donolly is a typical old goldmining town with some authentic old buildings; a lot more run down than Maldon. The camspite was in the town and it had a good sheltered BBQ and the chef was happy with the temperatures; but that strong wind was a bit cool.These barbies are great; they are in all the camspites; some free, some cost 20c or 1$.You find them in parks and recreation areas as well; just turn up with your food, put your money in and cook away.   "
310,"24th Dec Bendigo The mixing it with the Xmas Shoppers Day A lovely sunny day with the temps up to the mid 20's C.Caught the bus into town and just generally wandered around checking out the town. Lots of Victorian buildings, statues, watre fountain, pleasant park area, wide main boulevard with trams running up and down. A very pleasant place; is the major regional centre. I had my hair cut at an Italian barbers; he had cut hair for the last 35yrs here and still spoke with a very distinctive Italian accent. Town centre busy with last minute Xmas shoppers; we had nothing to buy really about from a few bits of food - we had that slightly smug look about us. Chatted to some Aussie couples in the evening who live permanently in their caravans; 6 months in Victoria and 6 months in Queensland.     25th Dec Xmas Day The disorganised Chinese Xmas Day lunch day A bright sunny and very warm Xmas Day - Merry Xmas. Kids on the campsite trying out thier new Xmas bikes etc - we did some clothes washign and then walked down to the Captain Cook Hotel/Motel for our previously booked Chinese Xmas lunch - it was our only option within the local area - better than cooking. The meal was fine but there were lengthy waits between courses; some people got served out of order or missing parts of their order etc. The staff were looking a bit flustered and the customers were getting slowly frustrated. Jo got a free coffee out of it. That was it for Xmas Day; we spent the rest of the day just lazing around and then phoned home in the evening to wish everybody there a Merry Xmas just as their day was starting.

We weren't going anywhere today as Beechworth had plenty to offer. It's another notable town like Maldon - goldming again. Lots of character buildings, museum. Had lunch in the excellent bakery again; Jo bought some new cycling gloves. Had another pub meal in the evening. Did you know - Ned kelly was tried here for some of his earlier crimes(but not the one where he ripped us off!) and Burke (the across Australia explorer) was a Police Superintendent here and there are no pokies(gaming machines to non-Aussies) allowed in any of the pubs(by local request).

317,"   03/01 Bright:short ride to Wandiligong:15kms The doctor's and administration day A hot sunny day; up to 30'C.I went to the doctor's; been having ear wax problems every since swimming at Ballater. Cost 35$ to get my ears syringed and then 10$ for more ear wax drops. The doctor kept saying 'look at all this wax that's come out of your ears, just look at all this; he insisted I looked - I wasn't really bothered; but there certainly was a lot. Went to travel agents and changed ferry date to 12th Jan; booked accomm at Melbourne Youth Hostal;did shopping; moved tent to a more shadier area;and all of this before lunchtime. I bet you thought this cycling lark was straight forward didn't you! There is an awful lot of admin involved.Went for 15km ride up nearby valley just to stretch the legs. Sat ad watched leaves falling off the tree; not because Autumn had come early, purely because everything is tinder dry. Victoria is having it's worst drought in 20years.

320,"   07/01 Bairnsdale: 0kms The seeking of air-conditioning day Aa hot to very hot day; the forecast was for 37'C so we invoked the high temperature rule and weren't riding anywhere today. Checked the bikes over and noticed Jo needed a new rear tyre so walked into town for that.In the afternoon there was little shade so we went into town again and spent 3hrs inside an air-conditioned cinema watching the very excellent Lord of the Rings 2nd film. BBQ use again in the evening this time with a bottle of wine and a chat with a young Irish couple who were coming to the end of a year working in Aus. The very noisy white cockatoos were becoming a nuisance; we thought the galahs were noisy but the sqawking, screeching childest behaviour of the cockatoos beats them hands down. They carry on until dark then start up again at first light - give us a gun!   08/01 Bairnsdale:0kms The seeking out of warmth day A complete change today; a SW change came through overnight so the temps dropped to 20'C and we had wind and rain. Waited a bit to see if there was going to be any improvement(no such luck, but the rain did ease off later); also we would have had one almighty headwind so we decided to stay put. In complete contrast to yesterday we were trying to stay warm today. So off we went back to the cinema again in the afternoon; this time to see the new Harry Potter film(and very good it was too).Back to the BBQ shelter area again in the evening and a chat to a couple of Aussie families. That's one of the joys of camping; you get to meet so many different people

321,
322,"   11/01 Melbourne: The down to the beach day A lovely warm sunny day so we went down to the beach at St Kilda on a day rover bus ticket 5$20 each and good value. Liked St Kilda; a lively cafe orientated place and good beaches and a pier to walk on with a Victorian style cafe at the end. Later we wandered along the sea front by the beaches up to South Melbourne and caught the ta back into town. The Australian Open Tennis Championship has just started in Melbournetow  12/01 Melbourne to Devonport (Tasmania): 11kms The ferry across the Bass Strait day Another bright sunny day bt hazier out at sea and luckily a smooth 10 hour crossing over the Bass Strait to Tasmania. The ferry left at 09:00hrs; we had to be there before 08:30hrs. Very good facilities on the boat and some good value meals available; e.g 8$ salad/pasta for lunch.They let us off the boat before all the cars and 20mins later we were sat in an on-site van on a caravan park by the sea in Devonport; we had booked this earlier as we didn't know if we would be capable of putting a tent up after 10hours on a boat. We are ot very good sea travellers normally.
"
323,
324,  
325,"   16/01 Stanley: 10kms The snakes alive day Stanley is a classified historical town first settled in 1826; lots of old buildings, mainly private houses. Went for a walk up onto the top of the Nut; you can also take a chairlift(but it's only a 15mins walk). Great views from the top and there is a path all the way round which has had it's grass cut short because there are Tiger snakes up here; we had one pointed out to us - only a baby one but scary enough for us as we were in sandals and everybody else had trainers or shoes on. Later in the day we cycled around the headland and went to visit the impressive house on the hill that used to be the home of a senior guy from an early Land Development company in the mid 19thC; it's slowly being restored.Interesting fact for Stanley: in 1892 when building the breakwater they put 5,000tons of explosive into the cliff to dislodge some of it; nothing happened - 12yrs later 200,000 tons of rock came down (that's called a delayed explosion!)   "
326,  
327,"  The cafe at Gowrie park did not open until 10:00hrs a pity as it was only 09:40hrs when we passed. We had some hard cycling to do before we could get a coffee. One big descent through forest down to the river and then a hard, hot 5km climb back up the other side. There was not much shade about; the cafe at the top was very welcome. After that it was undulations across a plateau area with the trees thinning out and the wind picking up. We got to Cradle Mountain campsite by mid afternoon; we are about 800 metres high here and the evening/night got quite cool. Luckily the campsite had an excellent large camp shelter/kitchen where most people congregated. On returning in the dark to our tent we came across Porky the big fat possum who had been into one of our bags and was quietly eating a slice of bread; we shone the torch on him; took his picture; told him to clear off but he just ignored us until he had finished eating. Cheeky so and so.   "
328,  
329,"  21st Jan Rosebery: The shall we, shan't we day A sunshine and showers day; more rain in the morning and just enough to put us in that do we pack up or do we sit this out or do we do something else. As decisive as ever we finished up doing next to nothing, which in hindsight probably was the right thing to do: we had had some hard riding this past few days and probably needed a rest. To prove this point Jo went to sleep in the afternoon and I just read. In the evening we went back to Nancy's for Roast Lamb this time; Danny and Helen went as well. We had a quick beer with them in a very noisy pub before going back to the campsite shelter where we chatted to 2 motor biking couples from central New South Wales.
"
330,  
331,"  24th Jan Strahan: The big boat trip day A total blue sky day with temps getting into the 30'C; it's expected to get even hotter tomorrow which is causing the bush fire-fighters down at Hobart a lot of concern.We left on the big boat The Adventurer at 09:00hrs for a very excellent 6 hour trip. First we went up to the MacQuarie harbour entrance known as Hell's Gate because that was what the convicts called it when they were being transported to the penal colony on Sarah Island. The harbour entrance is only 75 metres wide and has a history of shipwrecks mainly in the 19thC. We returned and went down to spend an hour with a very knowledgable guide on Sarah's Island. Then we went up the Gordon River and into the rain forest; this is a world heritage area because it is a rare temperature rain forest; the onlt other two in the world are in NZ and South America. The famous tree of the area is the Huon Pine that can take 500years to get to maturity and live over 2,00years; put's our short existance into perspective.We got off for a short walk into the forest before returning. An excellent buffet lunch on board as well; if you are ever passing this way then go on this; recommended. Very hot back on land and even in this cafe as I am typing this!   "
332,  
333,  
334,"  A good descent then some gorgeous scenery of lakes, forests and mountains by Lake Burbury - a bit like the Scottish Highlands. Stopped off for a 20min walk to the pretty Nelson Falls, but not a lot of water. More climbing (about 4kms) to get over Victoria Pass at 530 metres and then shortly after a shorter steeper climb for 2-3kms over Donaghy Hill; about 450 metres. We are in the World Heritage Area now - view through the hills of the strange looking mountain of Frenchmans Cap(looks like Napoleons hat apparently; not so sure).    An 8km climb then on a steady gradient to get over King Williams Saddle at 805 metres and then just undulations about this height to Derwent Bridge (Motel and Roadhouse only) and the turnoff to Lake St Clair and a campsite right by the lakes edge. Only basic foodstuffs available and as there had been no shops on route we were a bit short of food so seeing as it had been a hard day we treated ourselves to a meal in the Visitor Centre restaurant.Wallabies, possums and mosquitos out tonight; and two of them are pests! Chatted to a Scottish couple who now live in Perth.  Lake St Clair: 0kms The 'who's that burrowing under our tent' day What fun we had last night; well Jo mainly, I was snoring my head off. First off before we went to sleep we found a possum sitting on my rear pannier rack trying to get into one of the panniers; we brought the food inside the tent for the night. Later Jo woke up to find a possum burrowing under the flysheet and then under the groundsheet trying to get at the food; she had to hit him on the nose with a tube of cream a few times before he took the hint and left; we then slept with the food between us.What a pest! Oh and something else that are pests - march flies; with normal flies you can swat them and they will move away - not the march fly; it just continues to fly around your face.After last nights fun we had a lovely sunny day to wander around for 2-3 hrs some of the local walks. Saw a 2 foot black Tiger snake on the path - it moved away very quickly. Chatted to a National Park warden who made us a cup of Billy Tea(i.e tea leaves and eculyptus leaves infused together); very nice.Apparently you can also make it with sassafras leaves but be warned they are slightly halucenogenic Wallabies and possums out again in the evening/night. We tried to hang the pannier with the food in it from a tree branch; that was no good. We heard this noise, got out of the tent to see Percy Possum hanging upside down trying to get inside it -  so once again we brought the food inside and had no further problems. Fact: Lake St Clair is Australias deepest lake at 167 metres.

338,"  The saturday Salamanca market was big and very varied - Jo bought herself a new sun hat(a squashable one); the old one was getting a bit silly - and embarrassing. Her thermorest was also coming to the end of it's days(it had started to blow up like a football and she couldn't really sleep on it any more) - so more expense. Did you know that Errol Flynn was born in Hobart 02/02 Hobart: 22kms A total blue sky day and warm to hot. Rode into Hobart centre from campsite along a cycle path for most of the way right down to the quayside. Had a look around the various historical plaques and buildings of the area before heading off for our coffee and an hour on the internet to get up to date with everything. Went to the Info Centre before cycling to Hobart Youth Hostel which would give us a handier base to get the car and also somewhere to leave the bikes. On a whim when we got there we booked a trip up to the top of Mt Wellington for 14:30hrs; we were contemplating riding up but it was a bit too hot today and we had decided that we were having a rest now for the next few days anyway.The views down to Hobart and across sea and countryside were fantastic - we certainly picked the right day for it.    03/02 Hobart to Mt Field (in the car) Took delivery of our late 1980's Holden car; cost about 40 dollars a day.Another totally blue sky hot day with high temperatures up to high 20's. We went for a walk at Mt Field around the various waterfalls; we didn't have the weather for this when we were here on the bikes and we fancied returning here. One strange thing today was whilst walking around the track a policeman on a mountainbike came racing around the corner - but what was he looking for? Lovely waterfalls even though there wasn't much water coming over; all three were totally different. The walk also took us through a Tall Trees(Swamp Gums) area - very impressive and beautiful. These trees are the tallest hardwood and the tallest flowering plant in the world. The biggest one was 98 metres tall; what makes them look taller is that the first branches are about halfway up and the trunks are as straight as a die. One of the fallen trees was growing in 1642 when Abel Tasman first discovered the island.Another interesting fact: the guy behind the cafe counter made 72 packed lunches today for firefighters who were tackling some local bush fires. 04/02 Mt Field: day trip out to Gordon Dam A hot to scorching day and a total blue sky one; temps up into the 30's.Severe fire risk today. We drove out on a hilly quiet road for 90+ kms mainly through forrests with mountain and lake views to arrive at Gordon Dam. This would have been one brute of a road to cycle especially as you have to come back the same way and apart from Maydena after 13kms there are no facilities whatsoever. The reward though is the wilderness scenery and the mightily impressive Gordon Dam which at 140 metres high is the highest concrete dam in Australia. There is a small Visitor Centre there and some superb viewpoints.     Other things of interest: ran over a 3 foot snake on the road(saw it too late); saw a feral cat; The small Wallabies in Tasmania are known as Tasmanian Pademelons(lots of them around the campsite);foxes are the latest predator in Tasmania (you have to report if you see one); there are platypus in the stream by the camspite(but we didn't see one). In the evening we went to a slide show of the South West Wilderness area given by one of the Park Rangers - some superb pictures; makes us want to come back and do some tramping here.         05/02 Mt Field to Dover A cloudy, cool day with on and off drizzle, sunnier by the end of the afternoon. Drove back down to Hobart and after a coffee and internet access session we drove south into the Huon Valley; a busy main road with some big ups and downs - not a cycling route. Drove into the Tahune Forest Park and to the 'Tahune Airway' - cost 9$ to walk up and along a suspended steel gantry that took you high into and above some trees for some spectular views of the forest, river and mountains and especially the trees. It's a totally unique view looking down a tree rather than up it. The scariest bit was going to the very end of the gantry as it protruded beyond the trees about 25 metres above the ground - and it wobbled a bit!     Also went to see the biggest tree(a Swamp Gum) in Australia - not the tallest, just the biggest at 405 tons. In comparison the Californian Redwoods can weigh over a 1,000 tons.Dover was a plesant small fishing/holiday township   06/02 Dover to Hobart A cloudy start becoming sunnier and warmer, quite hot in Hobart by mid-afternon. Drove back via Geeveston(where we bought some small woodcraft items that we posted back home); love the various types of woods they have here. Through Huon, the largest town around and then around the picturesque peninsular on an undulating road with excellent sea views(would be a good cycling road as there wasn't much traffic either). Through the small townships of Cygnet, Kettering and Snug, where we had some lunch by the beach. Back in Hobart we bought a new tyre/iner tube for Jo The other was wearing a bit thin), back to the Youth Hostel, where we had left our bikes. Phoned Daniel & Anne(the cyclists we had last seen on the Nullaboor, if you can remember that far back). Spent a few hours with them in the evening; gave us some good advice about the roads from Hobart up the East Coast. We would have liked to have stayed longer but they were away when we arrived in Hobart and we really needed to moving on now after our week off. 07/02 Hobart: day out to Port Arthur After our discussions with Daniel last night we decided not to ride down to Port Arthur (a busy road with limited hard shoulder) and also a very hard gravel road from down there to get up to the East Coast road.We met cyclists later who verified both of those facts.So we kept the car another day; it was 100kms down to Port Arthur and we drove straight down there for 10:30hrs. It cost 22$ each which included a 30mins guided tour and a 20min boat trip on the bay and as much time as you wanted to spend looking around all the various buildings of this famous old Convict Penal colony.Your ticket is also valid for 2 days if you can't get enough of it in one - we spent 4hrs+ there. Saw 4 cycle tourists today on our way down and back - we were glad we took a car; it didn't look enjoyable on a bike. On the way back we stopped off to look some sea cliff features at Eaglehawk Cove - sea caves;arch and rock formations.A good day.

340,"   10/02 Maria Island: The Island wandering day 0kms cycling A bright sunny day but cloudier and cooler by mid-afternoon.Went walking today, firstly to the 'painted cliffs' which are actually sandstone cliffs by the shoreline that have been stained by iron oxide deposits and weathered by the wind and the sea - a natural artistic look as opposed to anything you would see in an art gallery. After some lunch we wandered around the other coastline to look at the limestone cliffs, called Fossil Cliffs as they are jam packed full of sea fossils. Some good cliff and nountain views here as well. Maria island is a beautiful spot, we wished we had brought more food with us so we could have stopped another day or so. No shops, cars or roads or other facilities on the island; it's a great place to get around on foot or by mountain bike. Peace and solitude apart the pesky possums, wallabies and various birds that come looking for food around your tent. We saw our first wombat on the trip today. Quite a varied history to the island as well; Named by Abel Tasman in 1642; used as a penal colony from 1825 to 1832;then a convict probabtion station then a wwine and silk industry and in the 1920's a cement factory using the limestone. Now a National Park and a recommended diversion.   "

348,"19th Feb Launceston 0kms 'The gorge-ous day' It was a nice sunny warm day and we had decided on a sight-seeing/rest day but as we shold know better these walking around sight-seeing days turn out to be quite exhausting; sometimes as hard a day as a hilly cycling day. The Cataract Gorge is only about 2kms from the town centre and is a delightful 'wilderness' spot. We walked up a levelish path on the right side of the gorge in the picture which opens up a bit further up and returned on a steeper, higher path on the opposite side. There a number of other paths/walks you can do in the area - cafes to sit outside; a chair-lift across the gorge; a suspension bridge; peacocks wandering around; a bit of a gem really being so near to the town centre. By the time we had completed this walk and then wandered around town before going back to the hostel we were well and truly shot and needed a rest - much prefer the bike to this walking lark.     "

351,"23/02 sunday A hot sticky day with temps up into the 30's C. Chatted to a retired couple at the Youth Hostel from Ossett(only 10miles from us). Did some clothes washing in the machine; when the previous load had finished we opened the top to find one pair of shorts in there. Obviouslt washed by someone who hasn't had the necessary coaching from their mother or else they have money to burn at 2$60 a wash! Bought a day tram ticket 5$20 each and hopped on and off trams all day; first going down to St Kilda for a wander around the sunday Arts and Crafts market and some lunch later. Came back into town for some work on the internet and also bought a new silk sleeping bag inner to replace one of the old cotton ones we have. Of course Jo gets to be the first to use the new one - she says it's great and I can't have it! It was so hot during the evening/night that we kept the ceiling fan going all night long to keep us cool.
"
352,  
353,"  You can also pay to watch them nearby in the evening home coming from the sea;  hundreds of Fairy Penguins;we object to paying for natural events and anyway have seen Penguins before doing this! Carried on across the Island on undulating roads past the Grand Prix racing circuit and over the bridge to San Remo for a lunch stop. There was a sign here saying that they feed the Pelicans at 11:30hrs daily: why? can't they feed themselves. I sound like a right old grumpy today but can assure you I am not - these are just observations. Some up and down roads; brief chat to German cyclist going the other way; going from Brisbane to Adelaide. Just before Wonthaggi a roof rack on an approaching car came loose; the surfboard on top came flying across the road, luckily missing all cars. Another 10secs later and we would have been in target range. Had a coffee at Wonthaggi(sign says it is the site of Victoria's black coal mine; is there any other colour?) - he's off again. 9km down the road we stopped  at Cape Paterson and a campsite by the sea; cost 23$; our most expensive in 5months(he's definitely moaning now!). Anyway we had the lovely sound of crashing surf waves to lull us to sleep.

357,"  Stratford was the last place with facilities for 60-70 kms until Bairnsdale, our intended stop for the day. Had a coffee and cake in the bakery at Stratford and on coming out the rain started, so we dashed across the road and booked into the Motel at 55$ for a double ensuite room; we were going no further in this cold and wet and certainly not another 60+kms!. It rained heavy on and off all afternoon with very strong blustery winds as well. We were snug and dry watching the matinee film on TV; an old British B & W World War II one called 'A Very Important Person' starring Leslie Phillips, Stanley Baxter and James Robertson Justice - it kept us amused and passed the time.Had a Takeaway Pizza and a bottle of wine for tea.
"
358,
359,"  Nowa Nowa was a one horse place with a hotel(shut today) and a General Store(with minimal supplies).The camping ground was a querky little place with ornaments/sculptures etc dotted around. We managed to scrape together enough food from the General Store to rustle up a meal and had another cyclist to chat to; nobody else on the site. He was riding from Canberra to Adelaide(most of the way).

361,"  6th March Thursday Rest day at Caan River We decided on a rest day after 10 days continuous cycling; and the weather looked nice and sunny for the day, up to the mid 20'sC.Also the next day to Bombala will be hilly. A do nothing very much day; clothes washing, coffee in town (which is essentially a stopping off place for travellers-cafes/motels/hotel/garage and supermarket was about it). Rested and read all afternoon before going to the hotel in the evening for a good value meal. Danish cyclist stopping there; he was travelling light and only doing 50-60kms a day and had come to Aus thinking it was flat(??), he only had 53/39 rings with a top sprocket of 23 which he got changed a while ago to a 28! 7th March Another rest day at Caan River. The forecast today was for 30'C and above with a northerly wind(we would be going north); so we decided not to go anywhere. There would be no facilities for 90kms to Bombala and a lot of climbing up to 750metres.At home we generally decide not to ride when it is raining not in sunny weather like here; the forecast for tomorrow is a cool change with showers - we are looking forward to that.We probably did even less than yesterday; Caan River can be walked around in about 30mins(slowly) and we had already seen everything. Had an evening campsite BBQ and chatted to an ex-pat from Melbourne (came over in 1976)who was travelling around for a week on his motorbike and he called himself the 'droughtbreaker'. And true to form it thundered and lightened through the evening and the night; quite heavy rain at times. 8th March An enforced rest day at Caan River Well would you believe it! After overnight rain it stopped whilst we packed up and went to the local cafe for some breakfast. Then it started again in earnest, bouncing it down. We hung around, had another cup of coffee waiting for it to ease up. No chance it rained on and off all day. At 11:30hrs we decided not to move and booked into the motel owned by the cafe; 65$ for an ensuite room with breakfast included. We read and watched the rain come down in between watching the Formula 1 motor racing qualifications from Melbourne(where it wasn't raining). Went back to the hotel for our evening meal.   "
362,"  Undulating road through pastureland took us to Bombala for about 15:30hrs.Bombala, according to the sign over the cafe is approx halfway between Sydney and Melbourne(about 550kms between the two). The supermarket was shut(sunday) and the weather looked iffy so (a) we booked into an on-site van on the campsite(33$) and (b)when the heavy rain stopped briefly at 20:00hrs we (that is me!) went out and got a takeaway pizza.
"
363,"   Got to the small township of Nimmitabel(pop about 300)about 12:30hrs and as soon as we were having some lunch in the cafe the rain started and boy did it rain; it was bouncing off the road and it was quite cold as well(temps were only, according to the local radio, about 10-15'C). It was 38kms to Coma, our intended stop today, but we would have to go slightly higher first and then would be in an exposed high plains area to Cooma. We didn't fancy that at all so booked into the Tudor Hotel and got a basic double room for 40$. No TV to watch this time so we read and rested and watched the rain pour down outside.We have seen more rain this past 3 days than in the previous 4 months.Ate in the hotel in the evening, we weren't venturing out in this weather.There was a log fire burning away in the bar lounge; heaters on the landings and we had 1 sheet; 2 blankets; a thin duvet and another cover on the bed. Wonder how cold this place gets in winter!
"
364,  
365,"  There was a Motel/cafe/garage after 30kms which provided a welcome coffee and pie stop.A long descent to the outskirts of Canberra and then a cycle lane for 15kms or so into the outskirts of town. On the way we saw the signs of the recent bush fires that ravaged Canberra; managed to find our way across town without difficulty(traffic fairly light) to the Info Centre to get our bearings and some information before going to the Youth Hostel nearby; there about 15:00hrs. And that's where we stayed for the rest of the day/evening.Nice location for the hostel at the edge of the bush with an outside verandah with views over Canberra.A lovely ride today even though on a main road; love the scenery around here.
"
366,"A lovely sunny very warm day; up to 28'C. Bought a day bus ticket for 3$50c each and went into town.After first going to the local shopping centre for (a) a haircut for me (starting to look a little scruffy); for (b) a free hour on the internet at the library; for (c) got some of Jo's films developed; for (d) had our normal morning coffee; and for (e) went to the local club to see a display of cycles and cycling memorabilia. In the afternoon in town we spent over 3 hrs in the very splendid War Memorial building and museum; superb displays; videos giving a different slant on the major wars for us Europeans as it focused more on the Aussie involvments; in Asia particularly. We could have spent more time there but it closed at 17:00hrs when they played the last post and closed the memorial doors - quite moving.  14/03 Frid: 17kms A lovely hot sunny day until... In the morning we went back into town to get some films developed and look for an internet place to upload some pictures(without success). Visited the very impressive new Parliament buildings on the hill; 90% built with Australian materials. You can actually walk onto the roof, on grass; superb views back across the lake and up to the War Memorial building. The parliament buildings were built into the ground to prevent them looking like they were towering over people in the city and so you can actually walk over the politicians whilst they are sitting. A very recommended tour around the place; very little security, you can wander moreorless anywhere.Got the bus back to the Hostel and then left on our bikes to ride across town to stay with friends for a few days. One big dark cloud got slowly bigger and it started lightening and thundering and spitting on us; then it got heavier and heavier and started hail stoning and before you knew it the roads were awash and we were absolutely soaked, only a kilometer from our friends house.Jo took her glasses off as she couldn't see where she was going and then we promptly lost each other; twice! At least it was warm rain.    15/03 Sat: Another lovely warm sunny day and a day of seeing more of Canberra.Ian took us around to see the damage caused by the forest fires that swept into western Canberra in January, destroying over 500 homes. Black dark forested areas, houses burnt to the ground; yet what was strange was seeing one house totally destroyed and then the next one hardly touched at all.Later went to see the original old Parliament buildings; modelled on the english Houses of Parliament even down to the colours of the fabric in the two houses.Managed a final half hour in the Art Gallery before it shut for the day; finished the day off with an excellent value Chinese meal.    16/03 Sun: More sightseeing on another lovely warm sunny day. A car ride on around the surrounding countryside; rolling hills, farmland and lots of green grass which until 2 weeks ago had been a parched brown colour; some lovely open and sparsely populated countryside.In the evening Sonja made a BBQ for the family; their two sons came;they live nearby; their other son is a professional cyclist based in Europe.  17/03 Mon: More sunshine; went for a walk in the morning up onto the nearby Red Hill which provided some excellent views of Canberra and the surrounding countryside. There are a number of small hills around Canberra like this; the main feature you notice is that Canberra has a lot of trees and bush; you can hardly see the houses; every street and all the gardens have trees in them.Had a walk around the very nice Botanical gardens later on and a visit to the nearby National Museum by the lake.We could have spent a lot longer there but it closed at 17:00hrs.
"
367,
368,"  Pleasant shock in Goulburn! - we were walking the bikes up the street looking for a cafe when a face appeared from inside a shop window; it was Greg from the Perth to Melbourne group ride. He was riding the supported NSW Big Bike ride, along with Julia from our ride. They were having a rest day(along with 1,000 others) at Goulburn. Spent some time chatting in the cafe about all things cycling before we had to move on. From Goulburn to Bungonia and onto Marulan we had some more lovely quiet roads; bush lined but with bigger hills than previously. Had our second puncture of the trip (well Jo did) on the way. No facilities at Bungonia though there was a cold water tap, thankfully.The Hotel Terminus was the only accommodation at Marulan, and it was fine; as much salad and veggies as you wanted with the evening meal. Did you known that Goulburn was Australia's first inland city; altitude 640metres and a population now of 24,000; some nice period buildings as well.
"
369,"  Chatted to a tandem cycling couple on their way back home(by car) after spending some time in Bright in Victoria (where we had been).Increased traffic from Bundanoon and not always a hard shoulder; what made it worse today were the bumpy roads, most of the damage looked to have been caused by heavy lorry traffic.We had a lunch stop at Moss Vale and then hit heavier traffic and the road seemed lumpier and bumpier and it was definitely hillier and it was windier as well. So by the time we got to Mittagong we had really had enough for the day; there was a camping ground here and they had some good value cabins at 55$ so we stopped. Went to the supermarket for some food and a bottle of wine and called it quits for the day.
"
370,"  The nearest camping ground was in the wrong direction for us so using the local info guide we rang ahead and booked a room at 'The old historic Scarborough Hotel' - a lovely location overlooking the sea and a good evening meal but the room and facilities were pretty basic; no curtains up at the window and no breakfast included, unlike the other pubs we have stopped at. We had to leave by the fire escape in the morning as well.
"
371,"  We were into the Royal National Park then, the oldest in Australia; it was severly damaged by bush fires in 1994 but you can hardly tell now; a lovely place. The surroundings took your mind off the climbing; one longest gradual climb and a  bit of up and down before we saw our first views(misty) of Sydney in the distance.   A nice descent took us down to Bundeena by lunchtime, a pleasant sleepy place with some nice beaches and a 30min ferry ride away from busy Cronulla. We were staying here for 2 nights as we could not get into Cronulla Youth Hostel until 24th(mon). Made some phone calls and arranged to meet Tom & Mark from the Perth ride and also Gayle a friend from home who now lives and works in Sydney.Another cyclist turned up later; he was riding from Brisbane, his home town, to Melbourne.   23/03 sun:  Some heavy rain overnight that carried on into the morning; a cooler day but drier by the afternoon. Caught the 11:00hrs ferry to Cronulla and met up with Tom who took us on a guided tour of Cronulla before going back to his house for a late lunch.The surf was up and there must have been a hundred surfers and swimmers in the sea, even though it was raining. In the afternoon Tom drove us out to Botany Bay and to Captain Cook's 1770 landing spot and a look in the Visitor Centre. Got the last ferry 18:30hrs back to Bundeena just as the sun was setting.Just got back into the tent before it started to rain again and then it proceeded to 'chuck' it down most of the night.  24/03 mon: Another cooler, cloudier day but at least the rain had stopped.There were pools of water all around the campsite. Caught the 10:00hrs ferry into Cronulla and went to the nearby Youth Hostel where we dumped our bikes and baggage and then took a train ride (45mins) into Sydney to meet up at lunchtime with Mark from the Perth ride. Spent a couple of hours at a pub having a beer and some food and a chat about all things cycling and life in general.We then just wandered about sightseeing and checked out a few restaurants around Darling Harbour where in the evening we had a very pleasant meal and chat with Gayle. The 21:30hrs train took us back to Cronulla.
"
372,"    UPDATE 2nd April We are now back home in the U.K and have added some more pictures; this is not the end of the journal yet though; need to fill in some missing sections which we will do a.s.a.p and also add a few more pictures and generally tidy up the whole thing. Some days the entries have been a little rushed. Watch this space.
"
373,"We loved the place so much and after coming across all the tramping opportunities and not having the right gear to go tramping we vowed to return the following year and do just that! This time we were 6 months away from home and after spending some time in Nepal and India we spent 4 months on both islands in 2001 tramping away. We enjoyed it so much we even returned the next year to do more tramping. In our 2002/3 winter we decided to give New Zealand a rest and get back to cycling so Australia was our destination for over 5 months. So when the conversation came around a few months ago as to where we were going this winter guess what came top of the list - correct! Well there was no competition really and anyway we haven't actually been cycling there for nearly 5 years now! The only issue was actually where were we going in NZ. We haven't cycled on the North Island before and we do definitely want to go back to the South Island so that's easy enough then we will do both islands. Then we thought seeing as we have already cycled across Australia why not cycle across New Zealand, that will give the trip some specific objective rarther than just wandering around. We just love the idea of cycling with a specific aim or objective in mind and cycling across countries/continents or from one specific point to another is just that. The only other issue was do we do it north to south or south to north? That was easily sorted as 1) we could only get flights into Auckland on the North Island  on the day we wanted and 2) our son Richard and his partner Elaine are  flying out to NZ for a 3 week holiday at the end of December so we had to be in Auckland to meet up with them for a while. So that leads us onto what the general master plan is ................
"
374,"This is predominently a cycling trip with the specific aim of getting from the most northern point at Cape Reinga on the North Island down to the most southern point on the South Island at Cape Bluff but there are a number of varients to this.... 1.  We will not be doing this in a straight line, or even as straight a line as you could possibly make on the available roads.There are a number of places we would like to visit and re-visit so there will be some wandering about, in fact more than likely a lot of wandering about. 2.  We are also going to try and get some walks in; these will probably be mainly day walks though we will try and get 1 or 2 longer walks in as well. We can't really take full tramping gear with us so the longer 4-5 day tramps will be out of the question unless we hire gear over there. There is the option of doing some of the private walks that are available where your gear gets transported for you; we could use our panniers in this case. We will be taking light weight approach type walking shoes with us and one large rucksack which will fit onto the rear pannier. 3.  We are going to cycle more gravel roads than we did on our trip in 1999 so with this in mind we have had some stronger wheels built that will take larger width tyres(up to 700x37). We are still taking our touring bikes in preference to mountain bikes as basically we just prefer them for long distance cycle touring and seeing as most of the time we will be on tarmac then that seems a sensible thing to do (for us anyway). 4.  We will be no rush to get anywhere in particular (other than being back in Auckland for our flight home on March 27th) so if we like somewhere, or if the weather is bad, or if we don't feel like moving on then we will stay put! Once we finish down at Cape Bluff then we will use public transport to get some of the way back to Auckland.  So the general master plan is to arrive in Auckland on Dec 6th and spend 3 weeks or so cycling up to Cape Reinga at the very top of the North island and then back to Auckland by Dec 28th and spend New Year with Richard and Elaine.We will then work our down to Wellington by mid to late Jan go over to the South Island and wander down to Cape Bluff below Invergill and then decide how we are going to get back to Auckland and that will depend on what the date is when we are there!"
375,"We have aquired a Psion Revo, courtesty of our son who no longer wants it.  So now we can type our daily reports up at our leisure whilst relaxing at  the end of a day. We have acquired a mobile phone with infrared connection/data transfer  faciities, courtesty of our daughter who has upgraded, so now we have the  capability to send & receive e:mails via the Psion without having to go to an  Internet cafe. We have signed up with an ISP (www.iberpass.com, based in Spain) who provide  us cheap call costs in NZ so we can send/receive e:mails cheaply.Thanks to  Denise Goldberg for this info as she used them for her trip to Ireland.As  far as we aware there are no 'free' ISP's in NZ,unlike the U.K(i.e where you just pay for  the phone call) We have tested the process here in the UK and successfully updated our  crazyguyonabike site.Many thanks to Neil for this excellent capability. The only other thing we need to do is get ourselves a Pay as you Go sim card  once we are in NZ, making sure we can get data transfer with it. This will  keep our phone costs down further getting local cost calls rather than incurring any roaming charges. So all being well the next updates you see may well be done via this process. We will also be spending time at Internet cafes especially when we want to spend more time on the net and also probably to correct mistakes made earlier via the Psion! Read on..............
"
376,"A long but uneventful journey to get to the otherside of the world. Up by 05:00hrs for an hour's taxi ride across the misty,drizzly Pennines to Manchester Airport by 07:00hrs and flight that left on time at 10:00hrs.About 12+hrs later we arrived in Singapore and immediately went to the Transit Hotel in the Airport complex to get our room we had booked before via the Internet.Rooms can be booked for a minimum of 6hrs(we booked 7hrs) and got ourselves some necessary sleep. It may have been 08:00hrs local time but it was about 01:00hrs UK time so we were tired! Late afternoon we went on a 2hr free bus ride around around Singapore and to Sentosa island specifically.Even though we have seen Singapore before the bus trip helped to pass the time before our 21:00hrs flight to Auckland. This flight was delayed by 45mins as soembody had to be taken off which a severe nose bleed and their luggage also had to be found and offloaded. We managed a bit of sleep on the 9.5hrs flight  to Auckland where we arrived at 12:0hrs on the 5/5 (Auckland is 5hrs in front of Singapore).The weather was warm and sunny with temps of 22'C - hurrah! It took us over an hour to clear immigration  - the place was crowded! When you enter the arrivals hall the scene is amazing - You come through the doors into a small area like a stage with people sat and stood in a large semi-circle in front of you; all waiting for relatives,friends etc and hotel/tour reps waiting for guests.We were half expecting some applause. A quick phone call to our pre-booked accommodation and shortly the van came to pick us up for the short ride there.  Excellent budget accommodation at Skyway Motor Lodge(about 5kms from the airport) - run an english couple from Bristol.As well as providing free transport to and from the airport they also allow you to leave your bike bags with them for the duration of your trip - well recommended. We just relaxed for the rest of the afternoon after quickly changing into shorts! We were a bit shot by early evening so after wandering around a nearby restaurant for a bit to eat we were in bed by 20:00hrs for 12hrs! The highlight before then however was meeting a Kathleen O'Connel at the restaurant(called The Bar & Baa,run by a large Greek chap). She tagged onto us and immediately mentioned that she was Irish though she was born and bred in NZ - her grandfather was Irish. She also said that her husband was a Liverpudlian though he was born in Sydney! She also said that she has a bit of a drink problem(that was a little bit obvious) though she was more worried about her smoking problem. The problem was she had to smoke whenever she had a drink. ""Have you thought about giving up your.....   on the other hand never mind"" It took us a good 10mins to get away from her in the restaurant but then she followed us down the street for a hundred yards - talking all the time. She must have some Irish in here as she could talk 15 words to the dozen! We finally dropped her by dashing across the road and waving our goodbyes     Sat 06/12 The day started off warm and sunny though we had some cloud and a bit of rain later in the day.We eventually surfaced feeling a bit refreshed by about 09:00hrs.The first job was to assemble the bikes and that was not without a little problem or two - the bags look a bit worse for wear as though one or two baggage handlers had been having some throwing practice. One of the straps was completely loose. The bikes looked o.k but we found out later that one of the new wheels had gone out of true - got that sorted o.k .Anyway by the evening after a trip into town we got the bikes up and running though as this is being written they still need to be ridden on.Downtown Auckland was a 45min bus trip away - we had a wander around,bought some more essentials (map,extra toiletries,spanner - we left ours at home!  - , and some food for tea , had a coffee.Another cyclist back at the accomm; haven't had chance yet to find out where she has been.A number of other Brits here who are on year long travelling breaks. A good chatty,friendly place.     "
377,"We left about 09:00hrs shortly after a young german cycling couple left;they were headed south - we were going north.We thought that by leaving Auckland on a sunday that there would be less traffic - no such luck.Every man and his dog were heading out into the country or the seaside and we had some hills to contend with as well moreorless from the start and one stiff brute of a hill reduced us to walking the final bit - our legs hadn't got going yet.We were constantly map checking trying to head aound the western suburbs of Auckland to avoid the major roads. Had a break at Helston with a pie from the bakery and went into the adjacent 'Toys for Hire' shop to get directions - yet another Brit(they are everywhere);this time a lady from Leicester who used to support Leeds Utd sent us off in the right direction. At Swanson where we had a coffee we chatted to an Aucklander cyclist who said that there is a cycle route we could have followed that would have saved us some hills and distance - the bad news is that if you don't know about it then you would probably never find it - it's badly signposted.Yet another example of a local authority not pulling their cycling weight. A steep climb from Swanson to Waitakere and then later some nice quiet roads unfortunately they were badly signposted and we had to flag down 2 cars to get directions- our map was the wrong scale for these small roads .The other frustating thing was at the top of yet another hill we looked back and could see the Auckland Sky Tower - it didn't look that far away considering all the effort we had been putting in to get away from Auckland!  A welcome lunch stop,actually more of a very very late breakfast, at Kumeu - we had bacon and eggs After here we had the main road which had a cycle lane most of the way to Helensville - the hills had lessened as well.The scenery although mainly pastoral farmland was pleasant enough; the one thing to grab our interest was a handwritten sign stuck to a tree that said "" Fart Tax It Stinks"" - the first person to tell us the significance of that wins a prize! By 15:00hrs we got to Helensville,did some shopping for tea and rode the 3kms down to the campsite at Parakai where there were also some thermal pools.We had a choice of 30$ campsite fee which included free admission to the pools or 20$ which did not - guess which we took. Correct! it's too early in the holiday to go splashing out and  we were to tired anyway to go splashing in!       "
378,"    The road got a lot quieter from here but unfortunately it got a lot hillier as well - up and down we went. You know when a big hill is due when you see a sign that says 'Scenic Lookout 5kms'- we got 2 of these today and the second one, Cleasby's Lookout, was just about the highest point around - we could see for miles once we got up there. Apart from the length of it,it was also steep in places, they were resurfacing the final section so we had a gravel surface to fight as well.Boy did we need a rest when we got to the top.The view to the west was to Kiapara inland harbour bay which for your interest has a total coastline of 3,200kms, so now you know.    We got to Wellsford before 14:00hrs for a well deserved coffee and muffin and then had a decision to make - It was either another hilly 30kms or so to a campsite or stay here; it looked like rain as well and we were tired. No point in killing ourselves this early in the trip.The only options here were pub accommodation on a busy main road or the Sun Valley Motel tucked away in a quiet corner so that was where we went and no sooner had we got established then it rained - so a good decision then! We nipped out to get something for tea and seeing as we were living in luxury a bottle of wine as well - we will certainly sleep well tonight.   "
379,"We came across another way of detecting hills to come - when you see a sign that says 'overtaking lane 2kms' This is a guarantee that there is a stiff brute of a hill ahead. During one of the descents we came across a lone cyclist heading the other way - no chance of getting across for a chat, a quick wave had to suffice. At Kaiwaka after 20kms we had our coffee stop and we timed it really well as 5mins later 3 Intercity coaches rolled up and disgourged their passengers for a break and subsequently for some swopping between coaches as baggage got offloaded.4kms from Kaiwaka after another big hill we diverted onto a gravel road for 6kms that provided a shortcut and a very welcome relief from he noisy main road. It was more up and down but we had the road to ourselves and could wander all over the place seeking the best surface.We knew it would be hilly as it was called Mountain Road!       It brought us out at Maungaturato just as a girl cycle tourist was going past - we stopped for a chat.She was over here until February and was doing the same loop from Auckland (but in the opposite direction) we were planning.She had also planned to ride up to Cape Reinga from Kaitaia(about 115kms) but had been advised against it.The problem apparently being the road is narrow in places,has no hard shoulder,and gets busy with coaches,campervans etc all racing up to the top. This gives us some food for thought over the next few days-we will investigate more at Kaitaia and make a decision there.  We had our lunch on a picnic bench at Maungaturato and just as we finished it started to rain so we dived into the nearby cafe for another coffee.More hills followed from here,in the dry now,to Matakohe 18kms further on.    We were there before 14:00hrs and initially had planned to carry on to Dargaville another 40+kms and with lots of flat roads so the girl had said but the weather worsened and the rain started and as there was a campsite here we decided to pack in for the day.They also had an onsite caravan available for 30$ so that avoided the need to pitch the tent in the rain.Isn't it a nice feeling after having a shower, cup of tea and you are sat relaxing under cover listening to rain pounding on a roof - yes. it most definitely is! Oh and Matahoke has a very excellent museum on the history of the Kauri tree in this region-well recommended.  Did you know that the Kauri tree is the second tallest tree in the world after the Californian Redwoods and specimens are dug out of the swamps in this area that are up to 50,000 years old.It's a beautiful coloured wood and is definitely our favourite.The problem is that there are't that many of them about now - the early settlers and logging industry took most of them. The only Kauri trees that can be used these days are those that are dug out of the old swamp areas.
"
380,"As it turned out the forecast did not materialise(at least not at 17:00hrs as I am writing this).It's blowing a fair old gale though but at least we are seeing some sunshine though there are some nasty looking dark clouds about as well.We'll let you know tomorrow if we get flooded out(we are in the tent tonight!) We had left Matakohe after 09:00hrs under a grey drizzly sky with a few minor cloud bursts for the first 2hrs or so - it was hilly as well initially but we never bothered putting our jackets on as it was warm enough.Our coffee stop was at Ruawai after 16kms by which time we were on the flat roads through fertile diary farming land.It continued like this all the way to Dargaville,the only problem was the troublesome wind.We might go on about the hills but you certainly get better scenery there whereas for 35kms we got farmland and mainly straight roads but it was a nice change nevertheless. The impressively wide Wairoa river was our companion for the final few kms into Dargaville where we arrived before lunchtime and seeing as we had no food that was good planning! The next campsite was 32kms away but the skies looked very leaden up there and also there was no town near that campsite for supplies, just the campsite itself in the forest ,though the info leaflet on it said it has a small store. After chatting to the lady at the Info Centre in Dargaville about the weather we decided to stay here and there was a good campsite in town as well. So if the weather turns really bad we will have a good base to stay put which we may well do tomorrow if it is not good as the next few days are through increasingly good scenery and we don't really want to go through it in really bad weather if we can avoid it and anyway we are not on a tight schedule to get anywhere fast (not that there is actually any chance of us getting anywhere fast!) P.S  Jo was reading this before we sent it and commented that I sounded like a grumpy old man complaining about the weather,the hills,the flat etc.Just to put the record straight nothing could be further from the truth I am as happy as a pig in you know what! I was only passing comment on the hills,the weather etc etc Late postscript: Had a pleasant chat with a group of local Maori's in the campsite kitchen in the evening and apart from giving us some lovely Banana cake they also mentioned that 2 of them are actually part Portuguese.Their great.great,great grandfather(or was it four greats?) was washed ashore in the 1800's from a shipwreck on the nearby beach and subsequently settled and married a Maori.   "
381,"Onto today then...... We stayed put because I have not been feeling 100% since arriving in Auckland with a bit of a sore throat, possibly picked up from the airflights. It was getting worse and we were concerned it would develop into the situation we had in France in July when I was laid up for 3 days with a throat infection. So off to the Medical Centre we went and after a 10mins wait and a 3min consultation (for $35) the Doctor confirmed that indeed I had an infected throat and prescribed some antibiotics.So after walking up to the Medical Centre on the edge of town and then back to the Pharmacy in the town centre and back to the campsite via the coffee bar and the supermarket we were both tired enough to spend the afternoon lazing about, this time making sure the cycle computer was on the right setting! What made today especially tiring was the hot humid weather we were having. It was a mixture of sunshine and cloud but still with the threat of rain around;  we got a couple of nice brief showers to cool us down but it really was an effort to do anything much - it was a bit sticky!  We were initially considering a visit to the town museum at the other end of town(about 3kms away) but frankly it's too much of an effort at the moment. We'll see what tomorrow brings. Just to confirm the stickiness today Jim the weather man came on the TV to tell us that the humidity in Northland was 75 to 99%  - it absolutely felt like it that's for sure.At least we got some rain in the evening to cool it down somewhat but the bad news according to Jim is that there is no sign of it changing for the next 2-3 days at least.There could be some sweaty cycling ahead. On the food front today........ We have been eating Kumara sweet potato - this area is the Kumara capital of NZ. There are a number of different types and colours(the skin that is) so we collared a woman in the supermarket for some advice.The result being that we have had the red ones tonight, which happened to be the most expensive, boiled up and mashed with onion - very tasty.You can also mix them with apple or indeed with both according to the 'expert' we spoke to. It's early to bed to get even more rest.   "
382,"In the morning we rode the short distance to the local museum which unfortunately sat on top of a small hill but there were some good views back over the town and river to compensate for the effort required (for me) to get up there. It was only a small place concentrating on the local history of the early pioneers, the timber milling and Kauri gum collecting days and the maritime history mainly - an interesting $5 worth. After that it was a visit to Info Centre to check on the route ahead; there are limited facilities after here for about 100kms so we may have to carry food for 2 days. If I am not up for it, as it is a very hilly route, we have the option of taking the bus but that only runs on Sat,Tues & Thurs. We also went to the second hand book shop as we needed to replace - you  soon get through books when resting about. The Lottery shop was advertising a bumper jackpot this weekend - over 12 million dollars - so we went in and asked for $10 dollars worth of winning tickets - please, no begging e:mails! We escaped one mighty downpour whilst in the supermarket and then got back to the campsite just before another one came across and thats's how the rest of the day and evening went on. The only other bit of info we want to pass on is the very lovely Pohutekawa tree, we have a few on the campsite. They are called the Christmas Tree and have beautiful red flowers on them - we will try and get a good photo uploaded to show you.         "
383,"We can't get out of this place!!! The good news and bad news day.The good news is that it is hot and sunny and no sign of rain; the bad news is that muggins is actually feeling worse than yesterday with a high temperature as well now. The good news is that there is a bus at 12:00hrs that can take us further up the road over the hills to Rawene; the bad news is that when we went to the Info Centre to book on it we found that here was only one seat left. The lady there said that 2 other cyclists booked on late yesterday. One option was try and find them and offer considerable sums of money for those seats (out of the question as I refuse to part with large sums of money) or of  course we could have let the sick person take that last seat and have the fit one ride the 90kms on her own but that option was never raised  - going down like a lead balloon would almost certainly have been the result and anyway we are getting to like Dargaville - it's growing on us. And there is more bad news - I sat on my sunglasses last night and broke them. Don't you sometimes get the feeling that the whole world is against you! So what do we do as we have already packed up and left the campsite and don't really want to go back and pitch the tent again. There was a campervan only park nearer the town centre that had ensuite cabins for $35 so by lunchtime we had established ourselves there and shortly after that one member of the party was flat out on the bed, asleep - guess who? There was a headline in the newspaper yesterday saying that NZ's weather is likely to develop into long periods of drought mixed with long periods of tropical rain.  One amateur weatherman on the TV has forecast (based on phases of the moon) that most places will not see settled hot dry weather until after Xmas - watch this space! Today is saturday, the weekend, so as from last night things started getting busier with Kiwi's arriving on site to have their weekend away or start their hols. The schools start to break up for their main summer holidays from about now so until mid to late January and especially over the Xmas & New Year period things will get an awful lot busier and particularly by the coasts. We did get something productive out of the day by going across the road to the Internet place and uploading some pictures - hope you like them. That was more than enough effort for me; I went back to bed. There are no cooking facilities here so it looks like a takeaway for tea so somebody is going to have to go out and get something but I'm a sick man and can't leave my bed. Jo on the other hand ................... Well it's not as though she has done anything today apart from making me a sandwich for lunch, bringing me cups of tea, coffee and water, checking on my well being etc etc and reading her book. She hasn't actually ridden 90kms so she must have loads of energy to spare. But just to show my goodside we went aross  together to the supermarket for a hot roast chicken and then got some french fries from the takeaway and seeing as it had been a bad day we washed it all down with bottle of wine. And just to prove beyond all reasonable doubt that it had been a bad day I knocked my glass of wine over!! I bet that there is no chance of those lottery tikets coming up! I
"
384,"I felt loads better this morning, the antibiotics must have kicked in or was it that bottle of wine last night? Whatever; we are on the move again but steadily. A hot sunny day beckoned but luckily with a refreshing wind although it was a headwind. We waited for the cafes to open at 09:00hrs and stuffed a big breakfast inside us to help us up the hills and beat the heck out of that headwind.     45mins later we were off on a reasonably quiet road with increasingly good scenery - rolling farmland, wooded hills, the sea came into view as well and finally the Waipoua Kauri forest. It was hard at times with that wind but we took it dead easy as we were only going 50+kms today. We decided to split the leg to Rawene into two to make sure I didn't have a relapse. We were also carrying 2 days of food just in case we got delayed weatherwise, healthwise or whatever wise never mind the hills and the headwind. We had a cup of tea stop at the Kaihu garage and tearooms (the only facilities on route); the cheapest ever - $1.60(about 65pence) for a big pot of tea or two. After one final long climb with some great views left to the sea and right to the forested hills we had a lovely descent into the forest and then a turnoff down a gravel road to the Waipoua Forest Visitor Centre and Department of Conservation campsite. By 15:00hrs we had had another cup of tea; pitched the tent and had a shower. The only downside was we came into contact with the first biting sandflies of this trip - no doubt the first of many to come - the only thing wrong with NZ we have ever found! The weather forecast in the Visitor Centre promises 5-6 days of fine dry weather after overnight rain tonight and some more tomorrow. More importantly the wind is forecast to switch around to S/SW - a tailwind. Can't wait for that. There was a good mixture of nationalities on the campsite tonight and we had a good chat in the campsite kitchen in the evening including a British couple (from Guernsey) who have spent the last 13 years yachting around the world and are currently moored up in Auckland having a break.We managed to stay awake until nearly 22:30hrs and then had trouble getting back to our tent in the dark -  we had left our head torches there.     "
385,"It's a 2 min walk from the road to see this colossus of a Kauri tree; the largest living Kauri tree in NZ although there is talk that an even bigger tree has been found in the forest but the authorities are not letting on where exactly that is. It makes you stop and gasp when you first see it - the sheer dominant presence of it amongst the other trees - the girth of the trunk is 13.8 metres; the trunk length is 17.7 metres and the total height is 51.5 metres and it has a total volume of 244.5 sq metres and it is about 2,000 years old - imagine that. That's the facts but the real impressiveness of it is actually seeing it -  a photo does not do it justice though we tried. We came out of the forest a few kms further on and had a great 4-5kms descent to the valley. When I got to the bottom Jo was nowhere in sight; I waited 5mins and then started climbing back up again and after 2kms met her walking down - she had punctured. But, hold on, where's my pump? - it's gone, either we have lost it somewhere or it has been nicked (suspect the latter). But, all is not lost as we have a spare mini-pump; but the last time we used that it did not work properly. However, ye of little faith, it worked and we were on the move again. Mental note - must buy a new pump.  So after that episode we needed a cup of tea and sure enough something turned up at Waimamaku further on. A one man band brewers place; a querky little establishment with the 1,000 litres brewing tank about 10 foot from the small bar. The beer (we didn't try any as we have more hills to climb) is called Hokianga Coachman's Ale and he only brews it now and then for his small bar and the nearby shop to sell. He only opens irregularly and is trying to sell the premises so he can move to a more touristy area - to make more beer and more money. The drizzly rain came on again after here and we had a couple of steep hills to climb (the last one was a real stinker) before dropping down to Hokianga Bay and Omapere where we stopped again - to get out of the rain and have an egg and bacon sandwich. It might have been wet and cloudy but it wasn't stopping the local kids jumping into the sea from the nearby pier - crazy or just young and carefree? For the last 23ms from Omapere the roads were slightly easier and also totally dry further on and when we got to Rawene the lady at the campsite said they had had no rain at all today - there was blue sky about and it got sunnier later as well. The campsite owners had only taken the place over last friday and were rushing to get things sorted before the holiday season rush started (the previous owners had neglected it somewhat). It is in a lovely location with views out over the bay - it's nice and peaceful around here. Hope they make a go of it. P.S Today's distance is my distance - Jo did 2kms less but then she did do the fastest downhill speed; 65kmph - she's crazy.       "
386,"   We were up early and were approaching the ferry landing in Rawene just as the 08:15hrs was leaving; no problem, we will go for a coffee. Once inside The Boatside Cafe we decided to go for the muesli, yoghurt and fruit dish as well. Well this got 10 out of 10 for presentation and flavour. For the fruit we had sliced apple and pear, kiwi fruit, strawberries, and grapes, the muesli tasted great so we took our time and therefore missed the 08:45hrs ferry as well - what the heck, there's no rush. The next ferry was 09:30hrs so we sat by the quayside in the sunshine waiting for them to refuel the boat before we were ready to go, later than schedule. So by the time we landed on the opposite side it was nearly 10:00hrs - we had taken nearly 2 hours to do 1km!    After that we had a lovely winding road with only a few hills in the 28kms to Broadwood where we stopped at the general store for a cold drink and a bar of chocolate that we both had suddenly got a craving for. There were more hills, and a couple of steep ones, to contend with on the 20+kms to Herekino. On the way we stopped for brief  chat with a Swiss couple on a tandem towing a Bob trailer going the other. They had been here for a fortnight, been up to Cape Reinga and were in NZ  for 4 months; you never know we may see them again.  At the small settlement of Herekino the only bit of shade we saw was under a tree by the fence of the local primary school. We were sat there having our picnic lunch when the kids came out and of course when some of them spotted the bikes they came racing over to ask all sorts of questions; where are you from? where are you going? what does that thing on your bike do? etc  When we said that we were going to the South Island one of them chipped in said 'it can snow there at Xmas time you know' And he is right you know, it can! The South Island must seem like another world to them living in this semi-tropical part of NZ - they never see snow up here. We had a long climb up Herekino Gorge after lunch (that was a jolt to the post lunch legs) but were then rewarded with an equally long descent before we joined a busier road into Kaitaia. We went initially to the Tourist Office to check where there was a campsite and also to book a bus back to Auckland from Whangarei on the 28th.We had decided after talking to other cyclists and realising that after Whangarei we would be on some of the busiest roads in the area at the busiest time of year that we did not want to endure that. The Swiss couple had said that they had not enjoyed that section at all -  a lot of it has to be ridden on State Highway 1 as there is no alternative.  So our plan from Kaitaia is to ride up to Cape Reinga and then work our way back and along the east coast to Whangarei. Our journey to the bottom of the South Island will continue from Auckland after the New Year. Only things of interest today: Lots of pretty pink wild rambling rose bushes by the roadside and some red ones as well. The region of Northland and particularly the past few days has a very prominent Maori influence. The kids at the shool were predominently Maori and there are marae's (the Maori spiritual ad cutural centres) in just about every settlement we have passed recently.   "
387,"So a gentle day today, late up, a few chores in Kaitaia before setting off well after 10:00hrs. Saw 2 more cycle tourists go past whilst we were having an early coffee; a young couple riding Scott mountain bikes so by any chance if you read this - hi there, have a good trip. Kaitaia is the most northern town in NZ and a busy place this morning; Xmas shopping is on the go - one of the main stores was open until midnight last night. After here the only places further north are a few scattered hamlets and small holiday establishments. Once we were well away from Kaitaia the traffic got less and less and there was a hard shoulder sometimes as well. There were no real hills and the wind was favourable so a good time was being had. Those early fears we had about the traffic on this road are so far unfounded though you have to keep your eyes out for the logging trucks which are racing up the road empty and racing back full. We stopped briefly at a Kauri factory shop for a browse around; if we were in a car we would be buying loads of stuff made out of Kauri wood (it's our favourite) - good job we are not; we would blow the budget big time! The main feature of the place was the huge Kauri tree trunk in the middle of the shop with a staircase running up the centre of the trunk to the floor above. Apparenty this trunk was put in place first and then the factory shop built around it. It was all polished wood and looked very impressive.      We got to Pukenui, a pleasant spot by a bay, pitched the tent, did some overdue clothes washing and generally lazed about for the rest of the day. I even found time and the enthusiasm to give the bikes a check over. Talking of bikes we haven't been able to replace the lost pump - the bike shop in Kaitaia did not have a high pressure one but what we did get were 2 valve connectors that will enable us to use a garage airline which will be superb if we can manage to get a puncture outside a garage! Seeing as we are having a lazy day we decided to have a fish and chip takeaway for tea rather than cook and very nice it was too. Other titbits of information: Apart from sandflies we have been in mosquito country for the past few days. On Jo's side of the inner tent there are a number of blood splatters, this is because she left a small gap on the zip fastener, some mossies got in and she had to go on a killing spree. A guy the other day said they are even bigger the further north you go - keep those zips fastened! Oh, we didn't win the 12 million dollar lottery by the way, not even a consolation prize -. will have to try again next weekend.  Went past the most northernly petrol station today; the sign outside said 'last petrol before Australia'  No doubt further up the road there will be signs for 'last coffee before Australia', 'last pub before..','last house before...', 'last toilets before...' - now that could be a problem! There are rumours that there is a sheep with a painted sign on it saying......   "
388,"It all started off peacefully enough with 50 kms of quiet road from Pukenui to Waitiki Landing with the sun out, pleasant temperatures, a favourable wind and some lovely scenery including sea views. We stopped halfway at the small settlement of Te Kao for a break and a meat pie from the general store. If you have read our Oz trip diary you will know we developed a liking for Mrs Mac's Meat Pies over there. Well, she has a rival - Len's Pies, sold here and a very excellent Steak & Oyster one no less. While we were eating them we heard this loud rumbling noise as though an overladen logging trunk was coming up fast except in this case it was a real beat up old car with a broken exhaust and with 2 little Terrier dogs hanging out of the windows and one real laid back driver. It spluttered to a halt in front of us  - we had left before it got going again - if it ever did that is!    There were some hills before Waitiki Landing but they felt surprisingly easy - was that because of increased fitness or just the fact we had a lot less baggage? Away to the right of us we could see 'The world's purest silica sand deposits' (that information is given just to expand your world knowledge)- you can get boat trips to them; just too far away from us for a good photo though. At Waitiki we had a coffee stop before tackling the gravel stuff to Cape Reinga. The first 50kms took us 2.5 hours, the next 21kms took us nearly 2hrs! This is a very hilly section and made worse by the variable nature of the surface; sometimes smooth but a lot of the time of a quite rough consistency, particularly bad on corners where vehicles had churned the gravel onto the edge. It could also be corrugated in places - that really jarred you about. Luckily there wasn't much traffic on the way there so we could pick and choose our line a lot. It was worse on the way back as we had a blustery wind to contend with as well as increased traffic so sometimes we just had to stop and wait. Also on the way back the wind direction meant we got a mouthful or two of dust everytime a vehicle went past us. The views were great so that compensated for the suffering, especially out to the west and to NZ's largest sand dunes. If you ever get a coach day  trip up to the Cape that also goes down Ninety Mile beach then you will get the chance to go tobogganing on the dunes - we've done it and it's geat fun. Cape Reinga itself wasn't too busy; there were only 3 or 4 coaches there so wandering around the headland was reasonably relaxed. The views out to sea and down the coastline were tremendous; felt like the edge of the world. In Maori legend this is the 'Pohutukawa' - the place of departing spirits. It is also where the Pacific Ocean meets the Tasman sea and the sea looks quite impressive over the Columbia Sandbar just offshore where the waves are crashing over each other. For added interest on the way back we had an encounter with a bull; don't know who was the most startled. I was about 100 metres in front of Jo about to start up a hill with a car coming down when this bull suddenly jumped out from the bushes into the road and turned and faced me from about 30 metres way. It wasn't going up the hill because of the car and it couldn't get back into the field because of a fence. We both stood still and stared at each other. I wasn't going anywhere! In the end the bull decided that a dusty cyclist was't worth bothering about and it darted into some nearby bushes and while it stayed there we gingerly went to the other side of the road and up the hill all the while keeping an eye on the bull and the bull keeping an eye of us and the cows in the nearby field making a racket as though to say ' what are you doing over there you big daft bull you should be here with us!' We got back to Waitiki Landing shaked, rattled and rolled so after a shower to get rid of all that dust and then a long rest we went to the bar in the evening, ordered our Pizza and downed a couple (or was that three) very welcome beers. They are very laid back around here so our advertised 30mins wait for a Pizza turned out to be 50mins. No big deal, it was worth the wait and in the meantime we chatted to the very smartly dressed barman who turned out to be the guy from the beat up old car. He recognised us because as sure as eggs are eggs we would never have recognised him. Goes to show you just can't go on appearances. He must have got a lift to work as there was no sign of his car outside. He also told us that the grading machine had been over the road to Cape Reinga yesterday to 'smooth' the surface. Crikes! what would it have been like a few days ago? Postscript: Today has just confirmed to us why cycle touring appeals  so much. We would never have got half of the experiences we have had today if we had done the same trip in a car. Mind you we wouldn't have got half the suffering either! You pays your money and you takes your choice.           "
389,"In the evening a couple turned with their fishing boat (all around here is a fisherman's heaven). The guy was as pleased as punch as he had caught a large kingfish today - his first. It looked large to us but he said it was only average size but when he gutted it there was enough coming off to feed a family of four for a good few days.  Coincidence of the day: On the way out to Waitiki when we stopped at Te Kao a campervan rolled up to the store immediately after we arrived. On the way back when we stopped at Te Kao the same campervan rolled up immediately after we arrived - weird. That's all you are getting for today as I am tired.
"
390,"From Pukenui it was back down towards Kaitaia under an early cloudy sky and light winds; it got sunny and warm within a couple of hours. We timed our arrival at the Kauri factory shop after 35kms badly as four coaches had just rolled in; this is a stop for them on the Cape Reinga trip. We needed a coffee break so we joined the queue rarther than carry on. A couple of kms further on at Awanui we turned eastwards after buying something for lunch at the general store there. A slightly busier road now after what we had been used to for the past 2-3 days but we had a hard shoulder and apart from one brutish short steep hill the cycling was pleasant enough.  It got even better further on when we hit the coastline and where there were some pretty beaches and bays firstly at Taipa where we had our picnic lunch by the sea and then  at Cable Bay after an up and down and then at Coopers Beach after another up and down. Yet another up and down (these were short sharp steep hills not gentle rises)  brought us to Mangonui where the book we had said there was a campsite. Unfortunately I didn't read it properly and it is actually 7kms further up the road and then 5kms down a no-exit road. Just when we fancied stopping for the day (Mangonui is a pretty place) we had another 12 kms to do. The book also said that there was a store at the campsite so on this basis we didn't bother doing any shopping at Mangonuil - save us carrying it 12kms won't it. Another unfortunately happened- when we arrived we found out that the campsite store does not open until Xmas and Hihi Beach is essentially just a campsite and lots of holiday homes - no store, no restaurant, nothing. The nearest store is back at Mangonui! However the gods smiled down and we got something sorted; we had some pasta; the guy could provide some frozen sausages (no idea how long they have been frozen so if there is no diary entry for tomorrow then you will know we have been taken ill - or alternatively of course we could be out of mobile phone range). He also had some pasta sauce and tins of fruit. That's tea then and we already have something for breakfast so it's all sorted! Let's get that tent up and relax and listen to the waves crashing on the beach only 50 metres away. Added information for today: There are a few Australian Lorekeets (not sure if that is the right spelling) around the campsite. Apparently somebody brought these brightly coloured birds over here and then let them loose and they don't know their way back home.     "
391,"   The first prize for today's cyclist soul destroying hill goes to that brutal son of a bitch out of Kaeo. It was hot as hell as well so It scores 11 out of 10 on the leg and lung busting scale. It was a good job we had eaten a Mrs Mac's mince and cheese pie and one banana earlier (what a combination) otherwise we might have retreated back down. By the way the American girl was over here for 3 weeks doing a circuit from Auckland and she was followed (well down the hill) by 2 german lads. A cyclists question - when you are descending one huge hill and you see cyclists just starting to go up it do you feel pity as in 'you really don't want to be going up there, it goes on and on and it's gets steeper' or do you feel respect that they are actually out cycling and attempting it or is it a bit of both? Before Kaeo we did stop by a road junction and considered going on a 40kms 'tourist drive' loop out to the coast around some bays and then back to rejoin the road we were on beyond Kaeo. If we had known about the Kaeo hill then we would more than likely have gone that way. The main issue however was that there are limited facilities on that route and we didn't want a repeat of last nights food problem. We were also looking to get somewhere today where we could stay for a couple of days and Kerikeri fitted that bill nicely We may have gone on a bit about the hills today but we did get some long downhills as a reward for all the effort particularly in the last 15kms or so before the last hill into Kerikeri killed us off. So as a reward for all that effort, when we saw the special offer on in the supermarket for a 1 litre bottle of Shirz/Cabernet for less than $7 we went for it. Downing that will sure stop any aching legs keeping us awake tonight; we should sleep like logs and anyway we are having a lie in tomorrow as we are not cycling anwhere - so there! Today's NZ/Maori vocabulary lesson: Whatuwhiwhi (yes, there is somewhere called that) is pronounced 'Fatufifi' - 'wh' is pronounced as an 'f' Monday 22/12 A well deserved rest day but the only downside to that is we tend to spend more money when we are not cycling.. Today's routine went something like - have lie in, after breakfast do clothes washing (in  machine), hang clothes out, walk into town (about 500metres), buy bike pump at last, buy pay as you go mobile phone sim card at last, have coffee, spend time on internet checking e:mails, finances etc and upload more pictures, look around shops, have lunch, another coffee, buy food at supermarket and back to campsite by mid afternoon for rest. Weatherwise it was very warm today, a bit muggy with lots of cloud about and a few spits of rain now and then. The worst of the rain seems to be further south and west, for the moment at least. Very busy in Kerikeri today with all the pre-Xmas hustle and bustle you would expect, the supermarket was very busy with people stocking up with food and drink.There was a guy with a Santa's hat on strumming his guitar in the main street but apart from that and a few token small Xmas lights in shops there wasn't a great feeling about the place that Xmas is just 3 days away. It is difficult to associate Xmas and warm sunny weather coming from the UK even though we have had it like this for 3 years out of the last 4.
"
392,"Today started off hot and sunny but cloud quickly swept across from the west but it then remained warm and muggy right through until the early evening when it started to rain and cooled down. We had left Kerikeri by 09:30hrs after returning to the mobile phone shop. The 'pre-paid' card they had sold us would not accept email transmissions though the sales assistant had previously said that it would. Turned out that because our particular Nokia model had never been for sale in NZ they could not manually configure it to accept data transmission - or so she said though she didn't sound convincing. We got our money refunded but we will try again in Auckland and get a second opinion. We had the customary hills again today but a bit more downhill than up and arrived in Pahia by 11:00hrs.This is the tourist capital of the Bay of Islands area and is really just a collection of hotels, motels and all other forms of ccommodation, cafes, restaurants, tourist shops and everything else geared up to take your money off you. But in fairness it is a beautiful location. You can do just about do all activities here - boat trips, swimming with dolpins, and most things that involve either going up in the air or down in or under the sea. We had a coffee here, re-arranged our coach travel and then hopped on a ferry for the10mins trip across the bay to Russell a much more relaxed place - some lovely houses scattered around the wooded hillsides with the bay on one side and then a short walk away beaches and sea on the other side of the headland. The ferryman was another Brit; this time from Surrey, he came here 20years ago. More cycle tourists on the campsite: a german oouple and a young Japanese lad.    A sign of the oncoming holiday season was the really busy campsite kitchen and eating area tonight - it was bedlam for a time with all manner of things being cooked and with different smells in the air, everything from chinese cooking to sizzling sausages.  The next diary entry will probably be a single entry covering the time here at Russell. If the weather is decent we will try and fit a couple of day rides in.   "
393,"We wouldn't have thought in the morning that we would be paddling in the sea by late afternoon as we were getting low cloud and lots of rain sweeping across in short bursts - a miserable morning in fact and it was quite cool. So, it was on with rain jackets and a short walk to the supermarket to do our Xmas food shopping and have a coffee. We bought enough food for 2 days and then when coming out of the supermarket saw a sign in the window saying they were open for 4 hrs on Xmas day anyway - we needn't have bothered stocking up. When we got back to the campsite with all our food there were two plastic bags full of food stuffs left in the kitchen area with a note on saying 'Merry Xmas - free food' Some kind people finishing their holiday had left it all. Being polite english people we selectively took a few items. Shortly after somebody else brought even more free food in and  shortly after that a young man walked in and said 'Is all that food free?' We replied 'Yes, take what you want' So, without hesitation, he filled his two plastic bags full and walked out with them!  The following will only be understood by folks back home: There was a box of Yorksire Tea Bags left which we quickly made use of. Thought we would not see those again until our return home; they tasted great being a lot stronger than the stuff we can get here, even without Yorkshire water! After one final strong burst of rain later in the day the clouds broke up and the sun burst through and it got hot and within the hour along with lots of other people we  were down on the beach at Long Beach Bay, a 10min walk from the campsite. What an amazing change from this morning and then a lovely sunny evening to finish the day.      The campsite kitchen wasn't as crowded tonight and there was a bit of a festive feel about the place as besides a Xmas tree in the corner there was a group of Belgians and Germans dressed up in their Xmas regalia having their Xmas meal - their custom is to celebrate it tonight rarther than on Xmas day. One of the Belgians told us the following: he got up to go to the loo about 06:00hrs this morning, crawled out of his tent, stood slowly up in his shorts, rubbed his eyes, and there in front of him were a group of Japanese doing their Tai Chi exercises - eastern culture meets western culture. Thurs 25/12 Xmas day - a relaxing Xmas day MERRY XMAS EVERYBODY A lovely sunny day with a SW wind and then increasing cloud cover but always warm until late in the day when the wind got stronger. A bit of a lazy Xmas morning with a short walk up to Flagstaff Hill, the highest point around Russell giving some superb views in all directions.         Our Xmas lunch was just a salad sandwich back at the campsite but we did have some Xmas cake, with icing on it. In the afternoon we went down to the beach along with a lot of other people;  we did intend to go for swim but it was starting to cool off by now so we just went for wander up and down the beach and a spot of more relaxing.We are starting to get good at this relaxing routine; musn't let it become a habit though, there's plenty more cycling to be done. Later, back at the campsite, the second medical problem of the trip - this time it was Jo, she lost part of a tooth chewing on some chocolate brazil nuts. Not a major problem for the moment and we hope it doesn't become one as there isn't a dentist available in Russell or Paihia until Monday 29th unless we pay a $75 callout fee first. We will be in Auckland by 29th so will leave it until then unless of course it becomes painful. It's just a minor problem with cold drinks/food and she has to chew on one side for the moment. Other cyclists on the campsite today are:- 1 german couple about our age, 1 young german girl and separately 1 young german lad. The japanese lad is still here but leaving tomorrow. The other german chap left today. Friday 26th Dec - a swim instead of a bike ride A lovely warm to hot sunny day, breezy later on. We were going to have a ride along the coastline today but Jo was feeling uncomfortable with her tooth. We caught the ferry over to Paihia for a change of scenery and generally had a restful day doing not a lot at all. We are both reading unputdownable books at the moment so a do nothing much day is ideal. Had a walk down to Long Beach again in the afternoon, I went for a swim, Jo read her book. Russell is getting busier by the day, should be even busier tomorrow. Lovely sunset. Saturday 27th Dec - a bike ride at long last: 45kms A cloudy start but quickly becoming a very hot day by the time we got back just after lunch from a spin down the coast and back. Not really a 'spin' as there were yet more hills to contend with and we were glad we weren't now going this way with full baggage on as there were some real toughies to get over - some excellent coastline scenery though to compensate.The UV factor today was 11+, the highest it can get; that means keep in shade beween the hours of 11:00 & 16:00hrs, slop the suncream on and wear a hat, so we did.     The holiday season is definitely upon us now as the campsite gets more and more crowded with some real big tents going up and it's a whole lot noisier as well, time to move on, which are doing tomorrow, catching the bus to Auckland from Paihia at 13:00hrs. The next diary entry will be after our stay in Auckland. We leave there on Jan 2nd.   "
394,"Weatherwise a cloudy sky with the threat of rain about but it was always warm and it got brighter the nearer we got to Auckland. We had a lazy morning packing up and then catching the ferry to Paihia where we lazed about a bit more before catching the bus at 13:00hrs for the 4+hr journey to Auckland, uneventful, apart from getting a text message from our son, Richard, who said that they were passing through Los Angeles on time on their way to join us here - expected early tomorrow morning. Once in Auckland it was just a 15min cycle ride to our accommodation in Parnell. We had nothing to eat for tea so went out for a Pizza and beer and then watched some tele. Monday 29th Dec - a real wet welcome What really miserable weather we had today to greet Richard & Elaine who arrived about 08:00hrs with the rain pouring down. It continued on & off like that for the rest of the day with low cloud and no sign of the sun whatsoever. The other bit of bad news was that one of their pieces of luggage went missing though we found out later that it had been left in LA and would be in Auckland via Sydney by tomorrow. Not a good start to their holiday. They managed to stay awake until md-afternoon before getting a short rest so before then we had a walk into town to get themselves orientated, have a coffee, and get some stuff from the Tourist Info Centre. There isn't much else you can really do in this sort  of weather. In the afternoon while they had a rest we went to see Lord of the Rings at a nearby cinema - excellent, the best of the three. We just spent the evening in with an early night for the jet lagged travellers.  Tuesday 30th Dec - how to blow the budget Jo got her well needed visit to the dentist today which was good news, the bad news was that 1 hours work cost us nearly $300! (about £115). Other than that it was quite a lovely day with lots of sunshine, very breezy and a couple of brief rogue showers. Richard & Elaine went doing their own thing including a trip up the Sky Tower though Richard didn't stay up there long - heights aren't his thing especially where you can look directly down through glass floors. Their baggage arrived this morning so that problem is out of the way. We uploaded some more pics to the website and generally had an easy day as we have visited Auckland before and seen most things that we want to see here. Anyway I needed a lie down after spending that much money!     One strange thing today: when waiting for the bus to town  a young loaded cycle touring couple went past with the male wearing a yellow tee shirt and towing a Bob trailer. Shortly after when in town another young loaded cycle touring couple went past in the opposite direction with the male wearing a blue teeshirt and towing a Bob trailer. We thought he may have changed his teeshirt until a few minutes later we saw the first couple again, in the yellow teeshirt. Later in the day we saw another cycle tourist - it makes you wonder just how many  there are of us here at this moment - and those are only the ones we saw on bikes! Weds 31st Dec - an island trip A beautiful hot sunny day for our trip out to Waiheke Island a 40mins ferry ride from downtown Auckland. We caught the 10:00hrs ferry along with 100's of other people who were either going over just for the day or stopping over there for the New Year. Waiheke is picturesque blend of farmland, forest, lovely beaches, vineyards and olive groves and normally has a permanent population of about 10,000 but is nearer 3 times that number this time of year; the place was heaving. We didn't intend to try and explore it all, in fact not much of it at all as we just went to the main settlement of Oneroa where we didn't really get very far from the cafes and shops and lazing down on the beach - the time just flew by. We did drool over some of the properties that were for sale in the many  estate agent windows. The prices however brought us back to earth - properties here are about the most expensive in the Auckland area but you can see why having a location like this.  We caught the 16:00hrs ferry back and then stayed in for the evening even though it was New Year's Eve - this lazing around can be real tiring and anyway we want to be in a fit state to go cycling tomorrow.         "
395,"A much more scenic route via Coromandel and/or Rotorua and the East Cape would take far too long and parts will be very busy now in high season though the East Cape route remains on our list of routes to do. We have visited Coromandel and Rotorua before so can give them a miss this time. The west side offers possibilities and would also be less busy, parts of it though, particularly through the King Country area below Te Kuiti are very hilly indeed but also very scenic. If we had more time to spare we could wander around there slowly making our way down. Quite honestly though we think we would like a bit of a change from endless hills after our exploits in Northland. So our initial thoughts are that we will head roughly southwards at first, seeking out minor/quiet routes where evrr possible, to get down near the Tongariro National Park and then swing south westwards through the Wanganui National park to Wanganui on the coast. We will then turn south eastwards passing near Palmerston North and then down through Masterton and work our way onto Wellington from there. The west coast road from below Wanganui into Wellington is mainly State Highway 1 and can be very busy and is quite a boring route and a cycling route to be avoided - we have driven it in a car so can vouch for that. That's the plan but god knows what will happen before we get to Wellington. We haven't at this moment in time decided on whether to cycle our way out of Auckland (about 30+kms) or get transport to clear the suburbs.   Read on and see what happens ......................
"
396,"We are off cycling again and Richard & Elaine are off doing their own thing for a fortnight though we have planned to meet up again before they leave NZ. It took us a while to get going as we waited until they had got their hire car so we decided to catch the train up to Papakura to clear 30kms of uninspiring Auckland suburbs. We had a further delay just before setting off when we noticed Jo's rear tyre was flat so in the end we finished up getting the12:10hrs train and it took 50 slow mins before we got off but then within 10mins we were in open countryside and on some quiet roads. The weather was hot and sunny and it was warm work with some climbing to get up Hunua Gorge, a pretty wooded area, but no steep climbs like we had had in Northland. Apart from 4kms of State Highway 2 later on we had a lovely ride today mainly through pastoral farmland so nothing spectacular to see though the Coromandel range of hills looked good across the water when we got closer to Miranda by the coast. There wasn't much in the way of facilities on the way - a garage grocery store at Hunua and a cafe on the highway, so we only stopped for a few brief rests and got to the Hot Springs camp ground in good time. Fact: the hot mineral pool here is the largest one in the Southern Hemisphere. When we finished today we felt very hungry and quite weak and realised that we had not really been feeding ourselves properly (in readiness for cycling that is) during our last few days of rest and more importantly today. The campsite store had some pasta stuff and other foods to make a decent meal up but we needed food urgently before we collapsed and we didn't have the energy to cook so it was a big burger each and a pile of weggies and sour cream from the pool takeaway that we stuffed down ourselves - it was quantity we needed not quality. It just about did the trick but now we need something for breakfast! Cyclists info: After having left Auckland both north and south we would recommend any touring cyclists to use public transport to get away from Auckland centre; it's much preferable to having to cope with the traffic. The rail system takes bikes for $1 and it only cost us $5 each for this trip.The last station on the northern side of Auckland is Waitekere to the west and this is an ideal starting point for the west coast route northwards.  The observant amongst you will have noticed that we left Auckland on Jan1st and not the 2nd as we said a few days ago - well we just had a change of mind that's all.   "
397,"We had to follow the quite busy State Highway 27 (with a hard shoulder) for about 18kms through Kaihere and Pateonga where another cafe appeared at the right moment as it was just about coffee time so naturally we stopped - we only need the slightest excuse to have a break! Scenically we were passing through pastoral dairy farmland and scattered small communities today with a small range of hills to our right and the bigger ranges of the Coromandel & Kaimai Mamaku Forest Parks away to our left.  Morrinsville is the main market town for this area but very quiet today with nearly everywhere closed for the holidays though we managed to find a cafe. It was13:00hrs and although Cambridge our intended destination was only another 32kms away we decided to stop here. Going on in this heat didn't seem the sensible thing to do and there was a small camping ground here so we found ourselves a tree with lots of shade around it and put the tent up there and put our feet up for the rest of the day, apart from the necessary trip later on to the supermarket which we decided to walk to - much too hot even at 16:00hrs; so glad we packed in early. Some info about NZ sunshine: Although the temperatures here don't often get up into the 30'sC range it's the strength of the sun that's the 'killer'. The UV factor is regularly given as 10 or 11 (this is the extreme top end of the range). A hat and regular application of 30+ sun cream is essential and the seeking of shade between the hours of 12 & 16:00hrs is also recommended on days like today. Today's temperature was only 26'C yet you could feel it through your clothes at times and we were having to drink like fishes as well.   "
398,"We had a variety of roads today, initially Highway 26 from Morrinsville but that was quiet this early on and then the secondary road to Cambridge was fine but the traffic got noticeably busier nearer Cambridge but then this is about the busiest holiday weekend of the summer. It was coffee, muffin and internet time here and it was then we spotted the incorrect sequencing of the previous 3 entries-apologies for that, it will be corrected (sometime). The secondary road to Te Awamutu wasn't too busy and with the heat going up a notch it was good news that the gradients were easy; we didn't need the granny ring at all today which was a total change from Northland when we seemed to be in it permanently. An enquiry at the Tourist Office at Te Awamutu showed us a route to Orotohanga via minor roads which although hilly had some great views and not much traffic but the downside was the melted tar. The difference in temperature was amazing from being comfortable at Te Awamutu at 12:30 to absolutely burning by 13:00hrs and if we hadn't got a bit of breeze at times it would have been unbearable - which it was at times! Scenically it was more pastoral farmland today but after Te Awamutu there were more rolling hills and some old volcanic ones with the forested Mt Pirongia at 959metres being the highest around; some lovely scenery to admire when we rested briefly in what shade we could find.    Today's walk to the supermarket wasn't too bad as we got cover along the high street and then rewarded ourselves on the way back with 2 LARGE icecreams which we had to stop in the shade to eat otherwise they would have been liquid on the ground. Today's little bit of info: According to Maori legend if the Pohutekawa Tree (the Xmas tree) blooms before Xmas, which it did, then we are in for a long hot summer, which at the moment it looks like being - apologies to all of those who are reading this in the middle of your winter but then suppose you don't have a lot of sympathy for us having to cope with this heat - do you?   "
399,"   Weatherwise we got a lot of cloud today and without the extremes of heat of the past two days but it was still very warm by late morning nonetheless though there was a nice breeze at times. When we finished at Te Kuiti we walked to the supermarket (seems this is becoming a bit of a daily ritual) alongside the river bank and whilst we were in there the sun broke through the clouds and it suddenly hotted up so the walk back was uncomfortable for a variety of reasons: 1) we had forgotten our hats and sunglasses; 2) there was hardly any shade and 3) more importantly there was no ice cream shop on the way back! - well you don't get many ice-cream shops by river banks do you.  With the advice from the camp ground warden at Otorohanga we took the minor sealed road through the Waitomo Valley, avoiding Highway 4, to Waitomo Caves, a busy popular stop on the tourist trail. We had no desire to see the caves (seen enough caves in our time) so it was just a meat pie and drinks stop. We found another minor sealed road when we rejoined Highway 4 later on and this took us all the way into Te Kuiti by early afternoon. The next campground/acommodation was about 80kms away so we weren't going there today. Have an early stop, get some rest and get some clothes washing done was the best idea - so that's what we did. Some NZ cycling info: All NZ maps, as far as we can make out, do not differentiate between tar sealed minor roads and gravel ones though they do for more major roads. It is possible to do quite a lot of cycling on minor roads, particularly in the North Island though you may have to wander around a bit at times. We have found the best thing to do is to march into the nearest Info Centre with your map and just ask. We did just that at Te Kuiti and found a good minor route for about 50kms tomorrow avoiding Hiighway 4 and about the same distance as well. The woman there was pretty sure it was tar sealed all the way as she said her son had cycled it. It doesn't really matter if it isn't as she said it is a lovely quiet route and much preferable to the highway - we shall see tomorrow. During our very pleasant sunny evening we got a text message from Richard & Elaine who were in Rotoroa. They had been white water rafting; result - Richard has a black eye and Elaine has a sore ankle -and that's the first bit of adventure stuff they have done. Do you think they will be doing anymore?
