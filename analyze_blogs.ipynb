            "At Owhango after 20kms we went across latitude 39degree south, so the sign by the road said. Then later on into view came the volcanic mountains of Mt Tongariro 1967metres and Mt Ngauruhoe 2291metres (these are both extinct) just as the clouds had quickly dispearsed from them to give clear blue skies and it was warming up a lot as well. The Tongariro Crossing is a 6-8hr walk across these two volcano's and is classified as 'one of the  world's greatest one day walks'. All very subjective but it is an excellent walk through a very unique landscape. We did it 2 years ago on a day very much like today. Further up the road the snow capped volcano of Mt Ruapehu at 2797metres (this one is still active, though currently dormant) came into full view - what an impressive sight. It was in our view for most of the rest of the day.      But just as things were looking really good they went downhill from here or rarther uphill and very uphill. The railway line  at Raurima goes on lots of little spirals to gain 200 metres in height to get onto the plateau whilst the road, darn it, just goes straight up. Not that bad you may thing, well, unfortunately it was steep (make that very steep) and the sun was fully out now and we were sheltered from the breeze so it was hard, sweaty work, make that very hard, sweaty work. The legs decided at the top that that was it, we're going on strike, enough's enough - give us a break mate. Luckily National Park village was a few levelish kms further on where we could get food, drink and some rest.  Mt Ruapehu dominates the skyline around here; the view from the pub window gets 10 out of 10. We were both a bit in collapse mode and thought that if the next 35kms to Ohakune was very hilly then it might take us ages with the state of our legs but fortune shined down on us and we got some good downhill runs and only a few short hills and then later a tailwind so we covered the 35kms in 1hr 20mins. The moral of which is: no matter how much somebody complains about something they can always overcome that obstacle with the correct determination - did you hear that, legs!      Anyway just to show that we have some compassion we are going to give them a day's rest tomorrow - well they have been on the go for 6 consecutive days now and have taken us up lots of hills. They deserve a rest - but only a day mind. Weds 07/01 - leg's rest day Cool, cloudy and breezy was the good morning greeting so there was no need to rush out of bed and we had no intention of doing that either - it was rest day! Ohakune is a pleasant place being a walking centre in the summer and a ski centre for the winter so it had lots of facilities yet was a quiet relaxing place and the campsite was only a 2min walk from the centre - we could manage that, so we did it twice, in between doing nothing very much. It brightened up by lunchtime to become a very pleasant day indeed - exactly what we needed.\n"
