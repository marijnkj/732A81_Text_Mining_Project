1,"Sleep was terrible. Major chest pain (ribs) and my rice n' lamb did not seem happy in me gut. Fallout from the accident? Finally fell asleep and woke up fine. It is almost noon and no news from my bike yet so I will likely be in Gisborne until tomorrow. Hopefully my bike will be fixed today cos I dont think the shops are open tomorrow and Northerlies are expected to be picking-up by tuesday - I plan on a 2 to 3 days to go North to Opotiki and fish on the way. I'll see how the cookie crumbles. Got me an orange safety vest this morning. Probably one of the best 20$ I'll have spent during this trip. Better than the red wine 2 days ago! ;) Also on the shopping list is groceries for 3 days... rice, pasta, peanut butter, bread... the ol' basic taka. Well thats it, another forced day off, but the weather is beautiful and Gisbourne is a nice place. I'll go for a soda on the beach. Cheers, Rene This just in... my bike will only be ready on Tuesday (today is Saturday). I will take a bus to Napier tomorrow and visit the Art Deco City for a day. Hopefully I'll be on the road not too late on Tuesday and make it over the the Waioeka river (about 100Km with a 700 - some meters climb). Oh well, thats the way it goes...     "
2,"The bus ride was an interesting experience. We were about 8 passengers in a big coach bus and the driver/surfer entertained us along the way pointing-out historic sites and landscapes. He also explained for 10 minutes what the buttons over our heads were for (lights, emergency....) and to go over and see him if the air conditionning was too cool, so he could heat it up, or if the air conditionning was too hot so he could cool it down. Go see him if the the music was too loud so he could turn it down or if the music was too soft so he could turn it up. And if ... Went for a guided walk of different art-deco buildings in the City. Long story short, in 1931 a 7.9 earhquake (on the Richter scale) (which is quite a big earthquake) and following fires destroyed a good part of the city. It was rebuilt with the 'in' architecture style of the moment: Art Deco. Since it was during the depression, the ornaments are not all that sophisticated (to me) but the city does have a special feel to it - and a definite unique touch: Maori patterns in the ornaments. Looked at maps for planning my next few days and pasage to the South Island. I'll likely bike to Opotiki from Gisborne (and fish the Waioeka) a few days. Take a bus to Rotorua (I've already biked half of the road to Rotorua on my way to the East Cape and there is something about biking the same road twice that bugs me) and do the Rotorua thing (Rotorua is a tourist must, rich with Maori culture - and fishing), bus down to Wellington, cross to Picton on the South Island (hopefully the seas wont be too rough...) and bike down to Christchurch. This itinerary would allow me to re-start my North Island tour in Taupo (late November), towards Taranaki, Waimoto, Te Awamutu (wonder why...) and (sadly) Auckland. I dont know what my tour of the South Island will look like after I make it to Christchurch. I will take a few days off with my cousin. I'll get him to brief me and work-out an itinerary - hein Bruno! By the way Bruno, I wont be able to make it for the 27th... maybe around Nov 1st. I tried but out-of-my-control events conspired to slow me down. And yes, Bonne fete Claudia! The song that I have giong in my cerebral juke box is a Steve Miller Band song, the one that goes ... 'I want to fly like an eagle' Time for some dinner. Cheers, Rene               "
3,"If ever in Napier, you have to check-out the Art-Deco (bien sur), but also go for a walk in 'The Bluffs'. Many nice houses, paths, parks, views. For the daring, dont do with a map ;) I had a map and by the time I made it out it was time to get back on the bus to Gisborne at 1:00 PM. If you bike the road from Napier to Gisborne, you are in for some serious hills, fascinating river gorges and narrow, winding roads. The mountains of NZ so far are mostly treeless - either clearcut or grazed by sheep and cattle. If there are trees chances are that the're a 'plantation' of the same kind of pine tree every time. Lots of erosion. Back in Gisborne I went grocery shopping for dinner and for whatever was missing for spending 2 days alone and if I did not catch dinner in the river. And if my bike is ready to go not too late tomorrow. Made my now famous (with myself) sauteed beef with veggies and pasta - but with cheese this time! Aint this exciting! I make me laugh. And red wine too - from Australia 2001 Shiraz, Jacobs creek. Red=Australia. White=NZ. not that Oz dont make good whites, but I have to give NZ wines a chance. Coming back from the supermarket, I had the bottle of wine on the outside of my daypack. A kid, maybe 13 years old came up to me and said something to me. I asked him what he had said. 'Keea-Oora!' with a not too distinguised tone of voice. 'Cheers' I replied. 'Is that wine for me or for you?' he said firmly. What the he.. are you talking about? I thought. Is this a threat? If there were 5 of you would you be taxing me? With nothing better to say I answered 'You wish?!' and walked my merry way away. If he had been 5 years older, that would have been a threat. After dinner had a good look at the waves on the beach. They roll a long time and form long white lines in the dark. Beauty. If no journal updates over the next few days, that means the bike is back and I'm gone fishin'. 'La Jasette' by Kevin Parent is today's song. Had it in mind while eating dinner. Cheers, Rene               "
4,"Around 12:30 Christine arrives, bikeless. Her first words were: 'Not good news'. I had to smile. The brake/shifter lever jammed - had to order a new one, will be in tomorrow. Now lets all sing the Gisborne Jinx! She told me she was getting a tune-up done as well. She is very nice through all this. Happens that her husband bikes quite a bit and their friend, Norm, runs a small bike shop for friends. I was planning on making it to Matawai, about 70 Km out of Gisborne, elevation 540 meters. That would have left some 10 Km uphill (to 725m) to the other side of the gorge for the next day. But instead I will re-pitch my tent in a familiar campground. Oh well. Christine offered to take me to Matawai tomorrow. If the offer still stands tomorrow I will take it. So wat did I do with my afternoon? Walked up and arounf Kaiti hill and all the Cook-related stuff (Cook made his first landing here). There is a statue to commemorate Cook, but it aint Cook. Ya gotta pretend its Cook. Funny. Bought some fresh Moki fish on my way back. Tonite is the Italy-Canada rugby game. Should be interesting, the All balcks beat the Italians with a similar score as the Canadians. Had some vegetarian chardonnay with supper along with the moki and garlic smoked mussels. Hope the legs did not lose too much strength over the 4-day break (Almost 5-day break). So If all goes well I'll have my flyline out tomorrow. Time to check the fishing equipment, make sure all is in order. Todays song, in honor of whoever is not Cook - Lets Pretend by the Northern Pikes.     "
5,"During the night I rolled to my belly/chest for a few seconds, trying to find a position to rest in for a few seconds. Something in my right ribs popped. It was sore from there on, nothing serious, but sore. Spent the day drinking salted and diluted orange juice. Chicken-noodle soup for dinner with bread. Hope that stays in. My chest realy hurts when I get up. This is a tough trip. Nothing stolen yet ... touch some wood. Rented a 'tourist flat' in the capground with a bed, shower, toilet... luxury! I may need to have the toilet nearby during the night... The Sun has set and I am very tired. Morale is low - hope it picks up as I recover from food poisoning. My bike is ready. Went to pick it up with Christine at Norm's place. He is passionate about bikes and I'm sure he did an excellent job. Merci! I am very tired. Song of the day? 'Anything is good for you' (if it doesn't kill you) by Crowded House."
6,"9:00 Christine picked me up in their pick-up truck and we were off to Matawai. She has been very kind. The radio played 'Thorn in my side' by Eurythmics. How appropriate... 'To run away from you was all that I could do'... thinking of Gisborne. Well there I was in Matawai with some 200 meters to climb - a reminder for the legs that the trip aint over. The climb was very painful. Not much food the 36 hours before, the poisoning, the ribs, the 5-day cycling break... but I made it. On the other side the scenery of the gorge is beautiful and spectacular. Stopped to fish 3 times, no luck but a rainbow trout did a salute (spectacular jump out of water) in the first hole. That was nice. The weather has been shifty but generally good. Hard to concentrate on the road with such a nice river next to it. I am seriously thinking about my priorities and waht I want to do with my trip. The delayt of almost one week and my guts remind me that I have to make decisions. I know I have to rest. Tomorrow Opotiki and Saturday Rotorua? We'll see. Big week-end - Labor Day on Monday.     "
7,"Ate 2 home made steak and cheese pies with ginger beer for lunch - my first real meal in 2 days! Okay, so to improve this trip, Item No 2:Make Christchurch a second start. Rest, rebuild the legs, and enjoy it. No3: This has to be fun. Narrow winding roads with trucks are not all that fun, no matter how beautiful the scenery. This may mean less biking - and no guilt if it is so (gotta remind me of that). We'll see. It is a beautiful day outside. I'll go and enjoy it (it is 3:20 pm). I also saw a doctor for my ribs. Likely soft tissue damage - not too serious. Good. Tomorrow the bus departs at 10:15 for Rotorua. Dire Straits 'Tunnel of Love' - I think thats the name of the song. Rene             "
8,"I did rest today and it felt good. I even dared having some ice cream. Yes! The weather is cloudy, windy and cold - good for resting.  Note: When the All Blacks score a try, the tune to play in the stadium is Something so Strong by Crowded House. Anxious to eat normally again. Appetite is back - thats good. There is a 'Grosse Pointe Blank' (the movie) ambiance in Opotiki this week-end - its the college reunion, 50 years. It was nice to see. Health is picking-up and so will the spirits. Its been a tough digestive/mental issue, especially with it coming right after I finally got may bike back after the accident. Thanx to family, friends and readers for support... and yes, I will enjoy the trip!
"
9,"It was quite strange to take the bus back to Whakatane and Ohope. I have already biked it and it was flooded then. Too bad we went by so fast, could have taken 'before' and 'after' pictures. There were wee sandbanks here and there in the fields following the flood. From Whakatane to Rotorua was a very nice road. Nice scenery (bush-covered hills, valleys, lakes...), good shoulder most of the way (with its narrow parts).  There was a big market in Rotorua where you could buy anything from couterfit CDs to circular sawbalde-clocks, soap and so on. thats where I thought of asking as a joke ' Where could I get a boomerang?' Never take a kiwi for an aussie. I dont think one would be very offended and take it as a joke, but still... Kinda like canadians and 'americans'. I have not yet slugged someone for sugesting I was a yank ;) Things are picking-up. I had my first real full meal in a few days tonite in a Chinese rice/noodle place. Just what I needed - with nice jasmine tea. Happiness is a cup of jasmine tea, friends and a healthy gut. Beauty. Spent the evening  wandering in the awsome gardens of Rotorua. Really, really unique and beautiful, with thermal vents scattered here and there, steaming pools - some a few square meters, some as big as an olympic pool. And bushes bloming, hot footbaths here and there. Beauty. Tomorrow I'll go fishing.  Quand l'appetit va tout va! Oh, and to finish the day, watched rugby on the telly with Andrew from Wales. We had a good time, good talk. Another chap from the English Isles on a honeymoon touring NZ in a van. He works with kids with all sorts of problems. A surfer, a carpenter, a Good man.     "
10,"The campground is quite small and cramped with vans, cabins, tents... today (the 27th) is Labor Day. HAd a good night sleep and for breakfast a ham and egg sandwich with a bowl of cafe au lait. And it all passed the gut test! yes! First coffee in almost a week - since the mussel incident. Hopefully I wont be whining and complaining about illnesses or mishaps in this journal for a while. Note: Canada will be playing its last rugby game of the World Cup Wednesday, which should still be tuesday back home, against Tonga. Should be a good one. Biked to Ngongotaha (10k)to fish late in the morning (usually not the best time...). There are small 2 streams that can be fished for a few 100 meters to their mouths in Lake Rotorua. The first stream had a few tires in it and a load of litter nearby, including an abandoned car. Not a pretty sight, but still, in a bend a little further down there were 2 dozen fish, stacked in the stream. Fished the hole with many different flies, nothing would make them move. I was about to move along when a man, maybe 50 with his son, maybe 12, showed-up. I let them have the hole and looked along... nothin'. The chap was Mike and his son Kyle. We had a good talk. He was from South Africa and by he told me he practically moved to NZ for the fishing! We traded flies, he gave me advice on where, when, how to fish the area - merci Mark! I checked-out other fishing holes, saw a few anglers and none caught a fish. Cooked me some dinner, hit the hot pools before sleep, beauty. Keep yer heads above water when in a hot mineral pool - or else ya might get amoebic meningitis. Sounds pretty nasty and serious and it is (something about an amoeba going through yer nose or ears and making its way to your brain...). Tuesday october 28th. Its raining cats n'dogs. Did not go fishing but enjojed the parks, the museum and orchid gardens. The vents in the parks are even more spooky in this weather. Tonite I go for the maori concert / hangi (feast) combo. A must do if yer budget aint too tight. A lot of outfits offer the combo. Some are likely better than others.  Tomorrow I head for Wellington, gateway for the South Island, a step further in this trip. I am a bit anxious to get back on my bike. The road from Picton (ferry terminal) to Christchurch aint the most exciting one, but it will be good to get back in shape. * The Hangi and concert were excellent. I ate lots and it all digested well. The performances were done with Mana - enthusiasm, pride and honor. Nothing tacky - well maybe the souvenirs but still very nice. I may just build a hangi oven back home. If you ever are in Rotorua and have the dineros, do it!       "
11,"The bus ride took almost all day, from 8:45 in the morning to 4:30 PM. The roads taken were roads that I had originally thought of taking, but plans are made to be changed. Between Turangi and Waiouru (south of Taupo) is a stretch of highway called Desert Highway, about 65 Km long. It is desolate, some good and winding hills and military training grounds on either side. It is not very inviting for a bicycle. I also saw a few 'cyclotouristes' on the road. I've seen maybe 4 couples or small groups so far, all since taking the bus. In Wellington I have an address, a friend of my brother's that I once sold corn with, about 15 years ago: Kirby (and Susan). Kirby and Susan live about 15 Km out of Wellington, to the North in Waiuiomata. I took the train to Lower Hutt, which is about 5 Km from Waiuiomata, just to avoid traffic and the motorway. The thing is between Lower Hutt and Waiuiomata, there is a pretty long and sometimes steep hill to climb. I wasn't prepared for that. I called Kirby, no answer. Destiny wants me to go over this hill by my own means - and I do need the exercise. Top off the water bottles and away we go. The climb was not too bad. Stopped a few times (reminded me of Te Motu hill) and this chap biked by me, going uphill, we exchanged short polite smiles. The hill is also a 6-lane road, lots of fumes from the cars and trucks - tough on the lungs. Not much of a shoulder. Glad I have my orange vest. Kirby had warned me of the hill in a previous e-mail, but I had forgotten about it... Did make it to the top and the chap that had passed me was there taking a breather. We had a chat and he told me to give him a call if my plans for accomodation did not work out (I still had not yet spoken to Kirby). Made it to my home for the night, greeted by Susan and Kirby, had a nice evening talking science, travelling, food poisoning... really nice.  Thursday morning Kirby brewed some coffee, showed me around the garden, the trees and took me for a tour of town. Actually, I'm a bit tired so I'll log this some other time. Some other time starts here: Yes, Kirby gave me a tour of Wellington, including Victoria Hill (is that the name?, I dont have my map in the Internet joint at the moment). Anyway, its THE place to have a look at Wellington from above. A great tour, merci Kirby. Got to see where all the faults pass through Wellington (including where the main motorway, the train lines, the water mains all follow the Wellington Fault (!), the Wellington airport with water at both ends and hills on either side - apparently the 2 things pilots dislike the most in an airport). Yes, Wellngton is a special place to live! Susan works in geophysics, so its appropriate for her! In the afternoon I visited the new NZ National Museum. It is huge, many exhibition halls, and free. I spent a good 3 hours wandering here and there. I tired to have a look in each hall, but I'm pretty sure I missed a few. Not only is it big, but its like an Ikea store - mazelike. I wanted to taste paua, a local shellfish, but its kinda rare so I had a paua fritter in a fish n' chip joint. I was served this four-inch wide, half-inch thick round, dark brown, heavy puck. Awful. Must be better paua out there somewhere. Tomorrow is Halloween. Halloween is not very big here - no trick or trating or decorations on houses but Susan and Kirby are throwing a Halloween party tomorrow. I am welcome to stay, but if the weather is nice, the call of the chamois will be hard to resist. Last but not least, I watched Canada win their rugby match against Tonga, 24-10 or something like that. The team captain, Al Charron, 37, the team veteran, back from serious knee injury a few months ago to make it for the World Cup was playing his last career game. And just like in the movies, halfway into the second half he got nailed. A clean hit. A hard hit. He was out cold lying on his back, still, blood trickling out of his mouth. The play stopped, got him out on a stretcher. The next day I typed 'Al charron rugby injury' into Google. He was fine.     "
12,"Once in Picton we all went our merry ways, Angelika and Phil left quickly for Ward (75 K), which is in the same direction, but farther than my destination: Blenheim (30K) for wine-tasting. I had a bite to eat before the ride. There was a beautiful tailwind, blue skies, comfortable weather, nice road with no serious hills. It was great to be back on the road. And I forgot my orange vest in Wellington. Note to self: Will have to get a vest in Christchurch. When I made it to Blenheim, I saw Angelika and Phil getting ready to head out after a breather. I stopped to see them, pondered... beautiful riding conditions with nice folks or wine tasting? Hmmmm... The riding won.  We rode at a leisurely pace, enjoying the tailwind and the beautiful weather. One of the best moments was approaching the top of a hill where the road passed in a trench. The view across the trench was awsome, a window on snow-capped mountains with dark, multi-textured clouds at their top. It was unreal. Made it to Ward, shared a bottle of wine and enjoyed the evening. Tomorrow's forecast calls for nice weather and northerly winds = tailwind. Beauty. We should make it to Kaikoura tomorrow... swim with dolphins? Have a crayfish (langouste)dinner? Could be a nice and expensive stay. Ya only live once. Half moon in the sky with tapestry of stars. Cant help but hum 'Moonlight Desires' by Gowan.           "
13,"What a beautiful day. Woke-up to a tough nights sleep. My ribs really hurt when I run or lay dow to rest, or move lying down - but it was a great day. HAd my daily Cafe au Lait in a tea room accross the campground with some bacon and egg pie and an apple turnover. Angelika and Phil joined me while I was talking with a farmer: Crops, sheep, subsidies, vines vs sheep... excelent. * Its noon, Gotta go see the dolphins! Well the dolphins got cancelled - the sea is too rough. So Angelika, Phil and I went for some lunch on the main in Kaikoura. Nice tempura calamari with a pint. Well wadda ya do when its beautiful outside and you have time to kill? (I chose to stay in Kaikoura till tomorrow to see if there could be a chance to swim with the dolphins tomorrow morning). Well ya ride yer bike around and Kaikoura is a good place to do just that. Wait a minute I'm logging day 33, not day 32! Yeah, day 32 now. Ward to Kaikoura. What a marvelous day. Hills to the right, ocean to the left, playing leapfrog with the rail line, tailwind, all kinds of flowers blooming and their scents filling the air. We stopped often for tea or to enjoy the sights or fix a flat tire (Phil - a ling rusty nail) and a broken rear derailleur cable. Actually we did not have a spare cable for the derailleur. Rumors had it that my jinx was contageous. The broken cable was on Angelika's bike. We blocked the derailleur in a middle speed and Angelika had a 3-speed bike with 40 Km to Kaikoura. Phil and I took turns at leading (the wind was now shifty) to give Angelika a break. Now that I think of it Angelika got attacked by magpies yesterday. Twice. One swooped down and the other dived twice onto her. Combine this to the flat tire and the broken deraileur cable - yeah, it does look like I am bad news! :)  The most spectacular stops were near Kaikoura where cliffs and rocky outcrops emerged from the sea, with heaps of seals sun bathing here and there. Some seemed to be fighting, fencing with their heads, others were swimming nearby in tidal pools. We spent quite some time just looking - as were 2 seal field workers, next to us. We also stopped so I could get a koura (crayfish / spiny lobster / langouste) in a roadside stand. I could already taste it, with a nice cold brew. All together now... all you need is beer, beer, beer is all you need... The koura was good, but not omigodthisisgood! good. Had it, one item checked off the to-do list. Nice dinner. Angelika, Phil and I got to know each other better. Thats nice. Kaikoura reminds me of a village back home: Tadoussac. Not a big place, lots of hostels, campgrounds, whale-watching and other sea-related activities on the menu. Tomorrow I may try to go swimming with dolphins... Cheers, rene         "
14,"After my morning cafe au lait, I headed back to the campground for extra sleep. Short sleep and wandered over to Angelika and Phil's caravan (not the best they had so far on their trip... the manager of the campground told Angelika and Phil 'Come with me and I'll show it to you - I want you to see it before paying for it'. Angelika was there and Phil arrived seconds after with 3 cups of coffee, one was for me :) Their whale watching trip was cut short cos the seas were a bit rough and clients were starting to change colors. Since no whales were sighted, the company offered a 90% discount for a second whale excursion tomorrow. Angelika and Phil will take it - and change campgrounds. I spent the rest of the morning in town, waiting for the dolphin swim, which Angelka and Phil also signed-up for. The swim was finally cancelled due to rough seas. As written yesterday, we had some lunch and I headed for the Kaikoura Peninsula. The Kaikoura peninsula is a very noce bike ride. At the end, there are walks, a seal colony and at low tide, a great rock shore to explore. Many sculpins, crabs, shrimp and shellfish in the tidal pools. Lots of good looking people too. Its a beautiful day. If you go to Kaikoura, explore around - its worth it. For supper I made myself a picnic by a beach, very windy but very enjoyable, overlooking the bay with sunset at my back. I had a huge hazelnut chocolate bar and devoured most of it. I suspect that all the nice people ;) I've been seeing lately are the cause of the chocolate feast. Finished the day by visiting Angelika and Phil who slept a fair part of the afternoon in their new accomodation. Watched rugby on the telly and shared green tea. They will be up early tomorrow to go whale watching and I will try to go see the dolphins, but not the 5:30 excursion, but the 8:30 one. Cheers, Rene       "
15,"I know some of you who know me will find me annoying with this, but the commentary of the staff was none too creative. That's too bad but hey, who needs to be creative to capture peoples attention when you have live, wild dolphins on the menu? Same old 'they weigh so much, eat this and that, migrate here, industrial pollution, blablabla ' I find it sad in a way. Never mentioned plastic bags, the greatest killer of the seas, which the Sydney Aquarium nicely stressed.  One thing they said that I liked though is that you, the diver, have to entertain the dolphin in order to get him to come and see you. If your're interesting, you have more chances of having one come by and even more chances to interact together. So we are out to sea, about 15 people on the boat, some dolphin watchers, but mostly dolphin swimmers. Dolphin swimmers wear wetsuits and 'palmes-masque-tuba'. The boat slows down, there are dolphins nearby. We all proceed to the back of the boat and the horn is heard. Time to jump in the cold water. And its cold. I felt my body contract at the contact of the cold water, not very comfortable. So I start swimming trying to hum a tune, but my body is a bit too tense right now. Humming a tune (making noise) is a good way to get dolphins curious and come and see. The water is a bit cloudy with what could be plankton, but the particles don't look alive  wonder what they   WO!! A dolphin just cruised by, at no more than a meter away and it is back out of sight in the lightly soupy water. Now that was impressive! Wanting to see more, I manage to hum a few bars of 'Tequila!'. Another dolphin shows up, and a second one, and another and  must have been 8 or so that passed me in a few seconds. One of them stayed a while and we swam in circles together. Tequila! Tequila! I saw many more dolphins, swam in circles with a few and noticed what may be the particles in the water  that's right, dolphin doo. I did not ask any of the staff, but I could imagine that 200 dolphins digesting together would make water a bit fuzzy. But don't take this for cash. We saw dolphins leap out of the water, do flips, the works. In the wild. Beauty. We dove twice in 2 different places. According to the staff, we had very nice swims. I believe that. On the bus heading back to Kaikoura, this bloke comes up to me and asks if I had been biking around the Coromandel  Why yes! It was Jane and Mark that I had met in Waihi Beach, the English couple on their round-the-world-honeymoon. To get over the sea-motion we had coffee back in town and a bite to eat. Nice. After 2 hours off the boat, I felt ready to bike to Cheviot and Gore Beach. Tailwind, blue skies, cliffs, spectacular coastal scenery. I had 54-40's One Day In Your Life playing on my personal jukebox. After 20 Km of coast, the road headed inland. Still sunny, but it was raining lightly - a few convection clouds were roaming nearby. Some of the raindrops were bouncing off the pavement  hmmm  rain does not bounce! It had started hailing, but did not last.  A few Km of hills later the winds shifted: cold, strong, steady southerlies. Just as I thought I was in the middle of nowhere, a sign by the road indicated a campground 1 Km off. Sounds good! I was 20-25 Km away from Cheviot. Too bad, these headwinds are too strong, medium-sized trees were now bending in the gusts. Anyway, very rustic but functional campground with free range chickens, une forge, horses, a bad-tempered peacock  you could have filmed a movie there. And that was a busy day.       "
16,"By the time I had everything packed, patchy, dark clouds were coming in, cold gusty southerly winds were blowing. As I was stretching a shuttle bus to Christchurch pulled in the farm's driveway. It had an empty bike rack welded to its trailer. I wondered if this was a sign to take it. I decided to go to Cheviot by bike and added extra layers of clothing - I was wearing half the clothes I had with me. The scenery is not as nice as the last few days. This combined to the punishing headwinds convinced me that it would be a good idea to bus it from Cheviot to Christchurch. In Cheviot, I have my coffee con leche and buy a bus ticket for the 1:05 pm bus for Christchrch. It is now 10:30 am so I have time to kill. The lady at the information center, Lindsey, pointed-out a few walks in the area. I headed for a nearby hill with a nice view of surrounding hills and the town below. The fields looked like lakes with the wind blowing through the grass, making waves. 1:15, I am tat the bus stop (Cheviot Tearooms) the bus comes down the road, but does not look like its gonna stop. I wonder if it's the right bus. I wave the bus driver as he slowly cruises by, he waves back and keeps on going. What the he.. just happened? It was the right bus and it didn't even stop - and this is a bus stop, not a pre-book bus stop! Go back to see Lindsey and she is upset and it shows when she calls the bus company (Intercity). There is another bus at 5:05 pm today. Lindsey stresses that there is a passenger waiting in Cheviot and that the driver better stop this time around. More time to kill so I go to Gore Beach. Gore Beach is a nice, off-the-main-road place, looks like a nice detour if you are traveling by this way. Beachfront campgrounds with minimum amenities and many summerhouses or homes on the hill. I head back to Cheviot Tearooms for 4:30, just to be safe with the bus. At 4:55 Lindsey calls the tearooms to tell me to wait for the bus on the opposite side of the road, just to be more visible. 5:05 no bus. 5:10 no bus. 5:15 no bus. 5:20 Lindsey stops by on her way home, I tell her that no bus has gone by. She goes back to her office to inquire on what is going on. A half hour later she comes back to tell me that she was told that the bus driver had stopped but there was no one there. What the he.., take 2! This is ridiculous! I think the second bus driver avoided the Cheviot Tearooms stop just to get back at Lindsey for telling them what she thought on the phone earlier. There is a 9:00 shuttle bus to Christchurch (not Intercity) and I am booked on it. More time to kill. I gotta say, Intercity  well, I wont say what I think of Intercity right now. I head for the pub, call my cousin to tell him that I will be in even later, have a meal, head for the roadside by the tearooms as the sun sets.  The shuttle bus stops right on time, there is only one other passenger and we head straight for Christchurch. My cousin is there to greet me, its great to be here, finally! Todays song is, well Mr. Cabdriver by Lenny Kravitz. But chage cabdriver for busdriver...     "

18,"Thursday I worked on the journal and the pictures in the morning. I will need a high speed connection to get the pictures up, so that will probably be Monday. In the afternoon went into town, missed the Wizard (I'll explain what he is about once I see his performance) but still enjoyed the fine weather. Went to the Canterbury Museum - now thats a wonderful museum! The displays are very well done and the presentation is just ... just... well I really liked it. Simple, efficient and creative. From the asian collection to groundwater to the antarctic, simply great. For dinner my cousin and I went out with some freshly arrived guests from France. Indian. Ate like there was no tomorrow... Buuuuurrrp! And it was really good too. Friday (today), went for a ride toward Littleton, Christchurch's harbor town. Boy was it ever windy. Legs got sandblasted as we walked by the beach. My boxershors are really worn-out so got some new ones at The Warehouse - 'Where everyone gets a bargain'. Haircut as well. Its still windy outside. Time to eat homemade pizza by Dave, who we are also celebrating - he handed in his master's thesis today. Yessir! Cheers!
"
19,"So what have I done over the week-end? Friday was a night out, something I had not done in a long time. Saturday was dedicated to recovering and resting. Sunday we went for a hike, lunch and rest in the mountains. Now thats resting! This morning I looked at the international weather forecast in the paper. The high for today in Montreal will be -1oC. It will be 20oC here, with sweet springtime winds, picking-up the floral scents of the gazillion blooming flowers all over the place. A feast for the senses. What lies ahead? Well I'm in no rush to leave Christchurch. The itch to ride is there, but this resting is very appreciated and needed. My eyelids stopped popping/vibrating (sign of fatigue) yesterday. I will hit the road when I'll feel fully rested and when weather forecasts will be a bit more favorable. Its really windy these days. And my hosts are very kind and I feel welcome. Plus Dave will give me a few pointers on Indian/Thai cooking! :) After talking to many people and with the Pedallers Paradise guide book, here is the plan for further ridig: I should be busing to Geraldine, at the foothills of the Alps and make my way along the lakes to Queenstown, not for the adrenalin adventuring for which it is known for, but to catch a bus to Milford Sound and back. Then off to the west Coast and up to Picton for a return ferry to the North Island. And possibly a walk on glaciers in the Franz Josef area with my cousin. I dont expect to have much time left once back on the North Island. I'll try to squeeze a short bike ride from New Plymouth to Te Awamutu. This is what the plan looks like for now. And plans are made to be changed. Rene"
20,"In the last week, what did you do Rene? Rested, Walked around Christchurch, uploaded pictures, saw Betchadupa last night... time is flying. I gotta see more live shows back home. Never pitch your tent under a tree where birds feed. Rene"
21,About Christchurch... It is a very nice city - lots of gardens and flowers. I've never been in such a hard city to find your way around - orientation without a map is impossible. Its been windy all the time I was here and beware of the foehn (sp?) winds - hot and dry norwesters - they can be strong and it is a scientific fact that people can feel drowsy when it blows. Its been a blast and its now time to move on. Thanx to all who made this stop so enjoyable. rene             
22,"Cheers,  Rene"
23,"The bus driver was again very friendly, pointing-out sights of interest on the way. In Geraldine, I fueled-up on home-made chicken pie and a tiramusu ice cream cone (and it is as good as it sounds!). Hit the road with a light tail breeze - Yes! But I still felt like cr*p - out of shape. I knew it would happen, but This was painful, plus I had allergies giving me a hard time breathing. I did't think I could ride 40Km. As time went by, and the rest stops and the miles, I felt better, fianally making it to Lake Tekapo, with no energy left. On the way I hit 10 bees and 4 magpies attacked me (just swoops, no contacts - they must play in the B-league). I was planning on sleeping at Pedallers Paradise in LAke Tekapo and meet the author of the guides I am using. On my way there, I meet two lady riders - Fannie from Switzerland and Sakia from Canada. We chat a bit but they dont camp in campsites so I go to Pedallers PAradise, but he moved to I dont know where! Now where did those two lady riders go? I catch-up with them and we seek an off-the-road place to camp - right next to the lake. This is good. As dinner is cooking with the setting sun, rings appear on the surface of the lake... Fish are feeding! Yes! Get the rod! Get the licence! Get out there! Get back with no fish! But it was worth the try. Sakia has a travel guitar with her so the evening is spent with music, good company and scenery. Stars were amazing. Kim Karnes(sp?) sings Bettie Davis Eyes. And todays song is Just Like Starting Over by John L.       "
24,"I was headed for Lake Pukaki and followed the very flat, linear, canal road for some 40 Km with a head-on breeze and Mount Cook to my right. Elsewhere scenery is desert-like with bare, brown, hills. Blame it on the Foehn. A chap fished a 17.5 Kg rainbow from this canal on the week-end. At Lake Pukaki, I must make-up my mind... Shall I go to Mount Cook or Twizel? The Nor-Werter seems to have kicked-in plus I wil se Mount Cook from up close with my cousin (clouds allowing) in two weeks. Twizel it is. The weather is hot and dry. Drink lots, good riding, but the nice scenery is at my back and before me are the bare brown hills. Hmmmm... After a snack inTwizel, it is 3:45 pm. Still good riding tme ahead to make it to Omarama, 30 Km away. What a boring linear road with bare brown hills. And the wind shifted (again!) - a head-on headwind. I hate headwind! And its blowing stronger and stronger. I am not a happy camper. Well there is nothing like a magpie attack for entertainment. By the time I make it to Omarama, the winds are ferocious and I'm tired and very hungry. While cooking dinner at the campground, an american fellow starts talking to me - (he is mid-50's maybe) - about cycling and fly fishing! He travels here every year to fish. When I ask him for pointers, he also gives me a few flies. Nice. I will stay in Omaama tomorrow to fish and relax. Cheers, Rene           "
25,    
26,"OK, today... Had a so-so nights sleep. already by 7:00 the winds were blowing. I took my time packing, had a bowl of cafe au lait, and hit the road around 9:30. The next 30 Km were uphill to Lindis Pass (945m) with wind, wind, and more wind - little of it tailwind. The climb plus the wind made for a tough time. The first few Km down form Lindis Pass, the wind was so strong, I had to stop to keep from being knocked-over by the gusts. I did not expect the downhill to be as demanding as the uphill (mostly concentration)! After a few Km downhill, the wind was at my back, the Sun was shining and the scenery stunning. An awsome ride. The wind and I were friends again. By 2:00 I had pedalled the 80Km to - arrgh dont have my map! - anyway, a small town where I rested, happy, fed my happy body and studied the maps. By 2:30, the winds had changed 180 degrees, and blowing hard. I thought of heading south toward Queenstown to catch a bus to Milford Sound. But the wind had shifted to a headwind. Looking West, I see Wanaka, some 30 - 35 Km away. I've heard of people talk about Wanaka in good terms, I could shuttle to Milford Sound from there and I'd save a day or two of biking toward Queenstown and back. Sidewind to boot. Wanaka it is! And the wind shifted. Again. A steady, tree-shaking invisible force was against me. And the rain started to fall. I could hear them Gandalf-like: YOU SHALL NOT PASS! I kept on, keeping in ming that it was only 30-some Km to go, and maybe with the rain, the wind would eventually subside. It did about 10 Km out of Wanaka, but the air was cold. I was cold too, hungry. Those last 10 Km seemed like 50. In Wanaka, the information center was hot and dry. My body felt good. Bruce from the Info Center booked me a bed for the night in a cozy Backpackers (I am alone in a 4-bed dorm - a nice surprise!), the shuttle to Milford Sound and a bed in Milford Sound for 2 nights. Indeed, Bruce is of great help. Cheers, Rene                         "
27,"I took the bus to Milford Sound in Fiordland. I've rarely seen such a fabulous road. Spectacular cliffs, mountains, rivers... And it wasn't raining! When it rains, waterfalls appear all over the place - I was told. The bus driver was a bitter man. Hard to talk to him if ya did not agree with him. We talked cos there was only one other passenger - so the 3 of us talked together. On the topic of cyclists, he was clear: 'I have no tolerance toward cyclists on this road'. I would not ride the road from Te Anau to Milford Sound myself, it is very narrow, shoulderless, a long-narrow-unlit-on-bare-rock-dark-wet tunnel to cross, dozens of tour buses every day as well. Something I have wanted to write for a long time: Slowing down is not an option for NZ drivers. There I said it. The only time I saw the bus driver smile is when I asked him if I was lucky that it wasn't raining. He paused for a while and told me it depends, cos it is so beautiful when it rains. So yes, but no at the same time. He liked the paradox. I stayed at the Milford Sound Lodge, squeezed by the cliffs in a river valley. Beautiful. Sunday was kayaking on the Sound. Again, Beautiful. I'll let the pictures speak for themselves, once I post them. Today is Monday, the 24th? holy cow, time really flies. I'm back in Wanaka, did my laundry and prepped my luggage for the next leg: Wanaka to Franz Josef where I will meet my cousin for some glacier-walking next week-end. Cheers, Rene                               "
28,"Will log more where a connection costs less than 11$ an hour :) Cheers Rene Songs: Blackfly, Beautiful Day, Angels Heap."
29,"Just a short log to say the weather is fabulous and winds cooperating, so I'm not in Internet cafes or libraries much. Am presently in Fox Glacier village, tomorrow I head for Franz Josef Glacier to meet my cousin Bruno for a glacier hike. Things could not be better. It should rain sometime so I can catch-up with logging the journal! Cheers, Rene"
30,"North to Lake Hawea, no wind yet, coffee in hand at a cafe I meet Neil, a photographer looking for a home in this area to get out of Auckland, where he has been for the last 5 years (Hong-Kong before that). We really had a good chat. As I hit the road, a slight tailwind is picking up. Sweet. Biking along Lake Hawea, I meet 2 English couples, 50-somethingish, biking my way (both couples are travelling apart - just a coincidence that they/we met here). So we chat enjoying the fine weather and leave seperately. I spend the afternoon bumping into each couple along the way. Pretty nice. Except the flat tire on my way over 'The Neck', but its a beautiful place for a flat tire (Angelika and Phil will understand:) Well a day biking in NZ is not complete without some headwind, so the last 10 Km into Makarora are done fighting the invisible. The two English couples and I meet again in Makaroa their destination for the day, but I will move on to the Cameron Flat campground, 10 Km farther. What a nice road, sheltered by trees forming an arch over the road. The last Km has tailwind (the road is due North all day), go figure. As I pitch my tent, the wind shifts again 90o. I am no longer surprised. After dinner, an man, maybe late 60's, strong build comes over for a chat. Meet Bill, a Scottish Kiwi, who has not lost his accent after many years in NZ. Wish he would have done Shrek's voice. He used to bike a fair bit, touring, racing with his older brother. We talked while terminating scores of sandflies. He also gave me pointers for my trip. I met a lot of people today, but no ladies. I must have a lady-repellent smell or something, but appeal to older folks. Good to have met all these people. Todays song is Beautiful Day. Indeed. Poupou, this one's for you. Cheers, Rene                             "
31,"Now what is really amazing is that Haast Pass is known for very srong N-W winds (which would be headwinds) and rain - lots of it. Here I am, under blue skies and a tailwind. Someone up there likes me. Stopped for a few short walks along the way. Many butterflies around - better than bees. A bus full of Taiwanese tourists stopped in a picnic area where I was resting. I did not feel like being a center of attention. But they got me. One came over to talk as a scout and then the mob arrived, asking questions then posing next to me. What can you do? I am now a celebrity in a few Taiwanese homes. And yes, headwind to finish the day. Quite strong headwind into Haast. In Haast, a man in his mid-40's, not too big, lean, in running clothes comes over asking a few questions with a strong euro-accent. He is Swiss and we chat in French. Meet Serge, and Nicole his wife. Serge is running around the world as a fund raiser and awareness for kids. Nicole rides a motorbike and follows Serge with their belongings for the 5-year, 35 000 Km journey in a trailer. I'll give you their website address later (www.serge-roetheli.ch). Well worth looking at, they are truly amazing. Todays song: the Forrest Gump soundtrack. Cheers, Rene                           "
32,"The road was fascinating. Lush, dense vegetation on both sides of the road. Felt very tropical. Stopped for a few beautiful short walks on the way. At the end of a longer loop-walk (90 minutes), a group of German tourists were back from the track, but there are no toilets here, so I caught a few off guard in the woods as I started the walk. Funny to see their reaction... 'Me?, Uh, nothing...' I broke a spoke on my front wheel. I only have spokes for my rear wheel which are shorter. I manage to squeeze one in to replace the broken one, but will have to replace it eventually. There are no bike shops for a few 100 Km. Todays song is KoolooKooloo by Richard Desjardins. Scores (literally hundreds) of sandflies in my tent as I left it open a few hours by Lake Paringa. Now what does Summer smell like to you? Bug repellent does remind me of summer. Practiced my fly casting on the lake before sleep. Sweet. Rene                                   "
33,"I started the day by walking along a stream uproad. Dont ask me why, I just felt like it. The first song I got in my head today was Self Esteem. It got me rockin on the road. and pedalling hard. There were not many walks to do, so I just kept on. Road, weather as usual were great. No incidents, no bad luck, just good riding. Excellent! Made it to Fox Glacier by 3 PM. Went to see the glacier, but felt dizzy, hungry. I had not eaten much today, so that must be it. Go back into town, look at restaurants menus, decice to go for home-made grilled-cheese n' ham sandwiches. Did dinosaurs molt? By sunset, the clouds that had the mountain tops hidden had cleared. Beauty. A chap told me that it was pouring rain in Haast Pass yesterday. I made it on time. Hard time falling asleep. Thisty throughout the night - must be those grilled-cheese sandwiches. Cheers, Rene                       "
34,"I ploughed through the hills under cloudy skies, occasional drizzle and cold. Uphills were OK, but my legs got chilled on the downhills. I had forgotten about cold + downhill + legs = cover up. By the time I made it to Franz, I felt even more sick, but manageable. I may have a wee fever. Bones aching. Tired. Feels like a cold. Just hope its not a bug in my guts. I did use lake water to cook, but made sure to boil it 7 minutes. I hope its not a bug. Had Giardia before, not fun, hein Fred! Had a bowl of cafe au lait in Franz (Nicole gave me 5$ two days ago to have a coffe on them) and a bowl of soup. Get fluids in and warm-up. Found an Internet shop that charges 6$ an hour with a good connection (good price). So here I am, logging the journal, 2 hours to go before my cousin arrives and feling a bit queezy under the clouds and cold. If healthwise I dont improve, maybe I'll go back to Christchurch with me cousin to recover. Hope my cousin and flatmates wont not mind (dont think so). Just keeping the options open. If I do feel better, I will hitch a ride to Hokitika with my cousin on his way back to Christchurch and go eat at Cafe de Paris. Very highly recommended by Kirby in Wellington. Will see how things go tomorrow. There is a bus just outside the Internet shop. Shop's big windows are wide open. The bus has been parked, with engine running, for I guess 20 minutes and is stinking up the place really bad. I've seen the worst looking fumes come out of vehicle exhaust pipes in NZ. Dont want to think of cant see gases. Put that in the not-so-green-NZ bin (which is already quite full with no return bottles or cans, terrible clearcutting practices, cattle in streams, scarce recycling, eutrophication of many lakes...) Not comparing with any other country, just noticing. Cheers, Rene-sore-belly-but-not-feeling-the-urge-to-go-to-the-can-RIGHT-NOW! Knock on wood.         "
35,"We later left for Franz Josef, pitched tents with the setting sun ambiance and the glacier as background. Beautiful. I had quite wacky dreams, but not the feverish kind. Just plain wacky. First item on the agenda, a walk on the glacier, guided by my cousin. An awsome experience - pictures will speak for themselves when up (I hope!). It was nice to be a small independent group, not part of a larger group among the hundreds of guided tourists. They lookes like chain gangs climbing the glacier, generally led by a quite neutral-faced an in-interactive guide. We were some 5 hours on the ice. I had promised my cousin dinner at Cafe de Paris in Hokitika today. Hokitika is some 150 Km down the road so I got a freebie ride in his car. On the way we made several stops, including Okarito Beach and some secret hotpools. Beauty. Cafe de Paris was up to its reputation - as recommended by Kirby in Wellington. After dinner, it was dark, we did not know where we would sleep - but Bill from Cameron Flat had pointed-out a camping spot on my map near Hokitika by Lake Kaniere, which we found. Today was an exceptional, well-packed day. Yesterday's cold made its way out of my system and the guts are feeling better. Cheers to that. Todays song is Some Like It Hot by Powerstation. Rene                           "
36,"Kumara Junction is a roundabout, with a railway track going straight through it. Does the train have to yield to its right? We unloaded the bike from the car, loaded it with my gear. I could not find my biking gloves and towel. I told Bruno that if the found the gloves to wash them before using them, tissues are not always handy when biking... I'm going North, Bruno East. Ya gaotta say goodbye sometime and we had a blast and thats good. Took some pictures and pedalled away yelling 'Four!... one two three FOUR!' Elvis Gratton fans will understand. Soon I had Brothers In Arms playing on my cerebral jukebox. Weather was beautiful, a side-tail breeze which would last all day (!). In Greymouth, got a pair of spokes for my front wheel, checked-out the forecast which looked pretty good for the next few days. I was in no rush to make it to Punakaiki - high tide was at 6:00 pm and it was 11:00 am. So I went for a tour of Monteiths Brewry. On the tour we saw a machine that takes crates of new bottles and gets the bottles out, ready for filing-up. So I asked a silly question: How are return bottles processed, if not in crates? Answer: There are no return bottles in NZ! Before leaving I met Robin, a chap that is biking NZ solo as well and crashed bigtime going downhill. His handlebar suddenly shifted 90 degrees, sending him overboard, bending the frame, etc... Major scab on his knee. Puts my incident in Gisborne into perspective. The road to Punakaiki is magnificent. More ocean, cliffs, bluffs, sun and tailwind. This is good. Made it in Punakaiki in time to check-out the blowholes at high tide, but since its only a half-moon, high tide isnt all that high = no blowholes. Fixed bike instead, big dinner, found biking gloves and towel. Went to the beach to look at the sunset, lots of people there, waiting as if for a fireworks display. My guts are feeling better again. Good. Rene                   "
37,"I knew the road ahead was hilly, but nothing too serious - just many 50, 100, 200 meter-hills to climb. Atop a hill I met a lady from Holland and a chap from the US, maybe late 30's on mountain bikes. He was working on his chain cos it had just broke coming up the other side of the hill. Blackend hands by the dirty chain, sandflies biting, stuck chain links - he was not having a good time. So the lady and I chatted about our current biking trips. That may not have helped the morale of Blackhand. I was soon on my way to another hill to climb with a group of organized-tour cyclists arriving. The sky was still cloudy, a light headbreeze, going down another hill, another lady was climbing up. We saluted, me of the hand, her with a smile. A wide sunshine smile. Should have stopped, but I was going downhill pretty fast. Should have stopped anyway. Stopped at the Charleston Cafe for an All-Day Breakfast. It was noonish, still cloudy, chilly and windy. Often NZ breakfasts are quite expensive. Example: 2 eggs, bacon and toast can be over 10$. This was a good deal breakfast and it was excellent. As I walked out the door, it started to rain, a few drops. Soon I had a decision to make, go directy to Westport or go through spectacular Cape Foulwind then to Westport (add 16 Km). I chose Cape Foulwind and went for a short hike there. The scenery was truly beautiful, spectacular and wet. The scenery and smells reminded me of Brittany. It started to rain steadily, but the winds were back to a breeze. There are many mines (as in mining / minerals, not landmines) around - for coal or limestone. Saw some pretty big mining trucks hauling limestone, but no pictures cos it was raining so much. Made it to Westport around 4:15, raining, chilly, wet. Met 2 guys pedalling around NZ on mountainbikes with their surfboards strapped to them (one of the guys also had a flyline). Now thats a first. There are nice surfing beaches around here. Got to a Backpackers hostel in a big old house surrounded by less attractive houses - some are boarded-up. We are 2 guests in the place. Lots of room. Ate a real big dinner, logging journal, falling asleep... Rene Songs: Rever Mieux; Ca fait mal en d'dans; and that song I think is from Dawsons Creek, you know 'I dont wanns wait for our live to be over, Will it be yes or will it be sorry....' I've heard that song so many times down here - more than any other by a mile - so much that it worked its way in.         "
38,"The road up the Buller Gorge is beautiful and very enjoyable riding - curvy, a few small hills... great cruising. I made it to Inangahua by 2:00 where I stopped for pies and ice cream in the shade at a store - the Sun was really beating down. The lady at the counter was quite talkative and we had a good time. Then the oddest thing happened. A large truck with 2 trailers hauling cattle stopped next to the store. The drivers assistant came out of the truck, unhooked the 2nd trailer. The husband of the lady at the counter (in his early 60s), walks over in front of the truck to protest by blocking it. The driver slowly drives forward. The husband clings to the front of the truck, feet dragging. The driver of the truck moves forward erratically, trying to get rid of the husband. Stops. The husband stands in front again. Truck moves slowly forward and so on. The wife which was away from the counter for a moment calmly says : 'Oh, he's trying to run him over'. WHERE AM I RIGHT NOW? THIS IS INSANE! The husband finally climbs on the front of the truck (it is one of those vertical front trucks), feet on the bumper, hands holding on some bar protecting the windshield washers, yelling face-to-face through the windshield at the driver. The truck moves event more erratically forward, a bit faster. If he falls, the truck wont be able to stop. The truck finally drives down a farmroad next to the store, husband holding to the front of the truck. I thought the driver might try to squeeze the husband between the truck and the bushes or something. Totally weird. I ask the wife what the he.. was going on. She explained that the driver leaves his trailer of stock next (sometimes in front) of the cafe, in the sun. The animals dont smell all that good, nor does their doo. The truck then goes down to the farm to either deliver or pick-up stock in the 1st trailer, comes back up, hitches the 2nd trailer and takes off. The whole process may take 30 minutes. The same scene happens every time. Ya gotta stand up for yourself the lady says. No matter, this is totally crazy. I leave the store the Sun a bit lower, but still very hot and a strong headwind. Gotta stop, which I did in Lyell, to give a chance for the wind to maybe change direction and the Sun to go down a bit more. By 4:00 and a heap of dead sandflies later I hit the road with a nice fresh tailwind. Beauty. Made it to Murchison around 6:00, hit the campground by the river, fished a bit, chat with neighbors, dinner and sleep. There were more trucks on the road today, which reminded me of the North Island. I decided that I will not bike on the North Island on my way to Auckland. The biking part of this trip will end in Wellington. A stop in Te Awamutu on the way to Auckland and that will be it. In the meantime, enjoy the North of the South Island and Wellington. Cheers, Rene           "
39,"Cheers, Rene"
40,"Todays songs (for days I might not have given any): A Criminal Mind, Gowan (crossed the Gowan River today) Head Over Feet (?), Miss Morrissette. More Than a Feeling, Boston - That song is getting huge airplay in NZ. Dis I mention Philadelphia Freedom a few days ago?  Not much Francophone... must be the english surroundings. So, about this day, well nothing spectacular. Got to walk an abandonned raiway track and tunnel. Yeah, that was cool. Always wanted to do that. As I rode, the skies were clearer, even some sunshine! Really not much civilisation along this road, but found a pub and by the pictures in it, a lot of bikers hang out here sometimes. Steak pie, wedges n' sour cream, and 2 ginger beers. I'm gonna miss the ginger beer once back home. There were 2 mean climbs today, the second being a long, steady, straight, probably 10% grade hill. Felt like Steve Bauer. I rocked the flats, struggled in the hills. Actually my legs felt jammed - you know the feeling, like they're made out of lead. Enjoyed a tailbreeze most of then afternoon, but after looking at the Ruterford monument, the winds had shifted to headwinds. Oh well. So I am in this town just south of Nelson, it is close to 5:30 PM, I will camp here tonite - lots of traffic - and bike into town tomorrow morning. Gotta clear my camera card n' burn a CD. Its full. If yer wondering why this text is makes less sense than usual, its cos I just stopped riding and full of endorphins, smiling with an empty look in my eyes. One beer and I'll be out. Beautiful weather outside. Cheers, Rene I do!           "
41,"The breezes soon turned to strong northerly winds. After breakfast I headed due North for Nelson, about 10 Km away. The winds pushed me back to Richmond with authority. So I waited, walked the Main, check-out some shops and the mall. It does not feel so much like Christmas - not many decorations outside and the weather is warm if not real hot (30's +). But in the mall, it is 'Christmas' - the commercial one. That was a reality check. By noon winds were still very strong, from the North. So I called-up some family and friends to shoot the bull a bit. By the way, it does not cost much (15 cents a minute) and with the calling card I have (E-Phone) the line to North-America is top quality. It was quite special to talk to folks back home, in the cold and short days. The winds were still blowing hard from the North, so I bought a book and headed for the pub for a pint. By 4:00 the winds had weakened, but it started to rain. I figured that since my stuff was already packed and loaded, might as well go to Nelson even if it was raining. Off to Nelson with a manageable headwind. Nelson has the largest motorcamp in the southern hemisphere. I was there. Good thing it was practically empty. And it rained harder. Fell asleep in my tent around 6:00 to wake-up around 8:00 (2 hours later) to clear skies and a beautiful sunset. Hit the pub for some grub and I was back to sleep... It is tiresome to spend all day waiting! I should make it to Picton by Monday to catch a ferry to Wellington. Cheers, Rene                 "
42,"The road from Nelson to Havelock is not really a nice one, scenery wise and traffic wise. Good thing its Sunday cos there are less trucks, and if I look at all the tree plantations along the road, there must be A LOT of logging trucks on weekdays. And the hills are very windy climbs. TGIS. Made it to Rai Valley by noon and chowed down my regular pie, ginger beer and ice cream. The big hills were out of the way, but the traffic was fast moving and the Sun beating down. The water level in the Pelorus River that the road followed was low. Somehow I sounded strange to me, but there it was, low water. I've been here since spring floodings and now, well its summer water levels. It was another 27 Km to Havelock. I was minded to get there in spite of the fast Sunday traffic, the Sun and the headwind (yes, a pretty strong headwind for the last 15 Km or so...). Met 2 ladies with heavily loaded bikes and daypacks on their backs, looking like they were preparing to leave. They did not look like used to cyclotouring. Felt like telling them to ship half of their stuff home, and re-arrange their panniers, but I didn't. I was tired and logged this bit into the journal instead. It is 3:15 PM, the sky is cloudless and the sun is really strong. I'll wait another hour before hitting the road again. It is 35 Km of up-and-down to Picton (and the Ferry). Will see how things go, likely camp somewhere in between on the beach. Last night in full cycling mode. Cheers, Rene Lotsa songs today. Les Colocs, Zebulon, Steve Miller... Finally made it to a DOC (department of conservation) campground around 5:00, greeted by the campground manager (there were only a few tent sites), a man in his 60's, white beard and hair, big smile with a tan, enjoying a sip of white wine with a bucket of HUGE green lipped mussels. I asked him if he got the mussels from the waters here - indeed, but at low tide, which was maybe 2 hours ago. So he offered me 4 of them. They are as big as my hand. I dug some cockles to add to that and had a fresh shellfish feast for dinner. Too bad I did not have a few beers with me. Great campsite, great view, great fresh food. This was really good. Also met a chap from Dunedin (NZ) we talked biking a bit. The sunset was dull coloured. Hmmm... we shall see what the weather is like tomorrow, but it dont look promising.                     "
43,"Cheers, Rene Later... On the Wellington side of the ferry, Susan and Kirby picked-me up before the Wanuiomata hill, on the Hutt side. Come to think of it, it was a good thing, that hill is steep, long and heavy traffic. Thanx. Had a few beers on the porch, supper and a quiet evening. Nothing exciting and thats OK.                   "
44,
45,"Not much biking planned from here on. The bike will be used for carrying my gear and travelling short distances in towns, etc. Its a special feeling to prepare the end. A big snow storm hit the eastern coast back home. Here it is 20-some degrees. Life is good. Cheers, Rene"
46,Thats all. Cheers. Rene         
47,"Many big cumulonimbus clouds patrolled the sky in the afternoon. Quite spectacular. The first part of the bus ride was very hilly and narrow roads. Made it in Te Awamutu late afternoon, hometown of the Finn Brothers and yes, I love their music. Something special was in the air, but hey, its also just another NZ town of some 8000 people. Nonetheless, senses were awake to get the feel of the town, from its sidewalks to the rose garden (where I had fish n' chips and ginger beer - Recomended by the campsite owner). Took a ride around town, located some Finn sites, went back to the tent for an early sleep but is it ever muggy. Hard to fall asleep. Cheers, Rene       "
48,"Spent the morning in the Te Awamutu museum which has a display of the Finn brothers (and Split Enz and Crowded House), local maori objects and historical items. A very well presented and enjoyable museum. Bravo! Will be taking the bus out of Te Awamutu to Auckland this evening, and go back to the campground where this bike trip started for 2 nights. See what the weather is like on Saturday (tomorrow) to see what I'll be doing - the botanical gardens are not too far from the campsite. Feeling the departure jitters, not wanting the trip to end, but also looking forward to see friends, family and my own bed. Hats off to my sleeping bag, slept very few nights without it. Well thats it for now. Gonna check out the town some more before taking the bus. Cheers, take care. Rene         "
49,"As I pitched my tent an English couple came by from the van next door. We started chatting away when the occupant of the tent next to mine presented himself, leaning against a tree next to us. He spoke very good english (at a somewhat uneven speed) with a strong accent - happened to be a norwegian accent. Meet Bob (lets call him Bob). All four of us went to the bottle store a short distance from the campsite, I could use a drink, Bob was almost out of a chocolate drink which came in a screw-top, 1 liter clear plastic bottle. At our return Bob explained why he was on the bottle, now he had some raspberry drink in a screw-top, 1 liter clear plastic bottle. Without getting too personal, Bob was escaping his newly ex-wife in NZ and he really missed his kids. He wanted to speak Norwegian bad. So I asked him what `Yes` was in Norwegian. It sounds like `Yah`. So he spoke to me in Norwegian and I just said `Yah` once in a while when it sounded right to do so. It helped a wee bit there and then. It was a special evening for the 4 of us around the picnic table. Must have been a tough morning for Bob the next day, but he was not up yet when I left fot the Botanic Gardens. The botanic gardens were not spectacular, but a good place to be on this hot and humid day. Great coffee too. Nothing much happened today as I ran errands and got my stuff together. Hmmm... Had supper at the Happy Days buffet, as I did on day 1, which was packed for Christmas office dinners. Yeah, nothing exciting today, but enjoying the nice warm weather before going back to winter. Cheers, Rene       "
50,"Final packing went well, got all the souvenirs in the panniers and I was off to the airport with heaps of time ahead of me. Had a last lunch by the airport with a ginger beer looking at airplanes taking off and landing. Then it was time for the Airport Procedures Bonanza (APB) to start. 1. Get box for bike.  2. Fit bike in box  3. Go through a pre-boarding security check. A security officer pulled me over asking if I was going to L.A. so we could check my luggage for anything that could mean trouble in the USA. He kept my empty but smelly fuel bottle, my leftover packaging tape, an open puncture repair glue tube. Off to step 4 now. * Wait in line  4a. Get panniers in a plastic bag.  4b. Check-in luggage.  5a. Find where to pay Leaving Tax and...  * Wait in line, and...  5b. pay the tax.  6. Fill NZ customs form.  * Wait in line  7. Go through NZ customs.  * Wait in line  8. Go through security post1.  * Wait in line  9. Go through security post 2.  * Wait in line  10. Boarding Did not have much sleep on the flight to LA, about 3 hours. Should not have taken coffee after dinner. Now to LA airport... Steps at LA airport... 1. Fill US customs form (on plane) * Wait standing in line (90 minutes...) 2. Go through customs 3. Pick-up luggage at caroussel 4. Go through customs with luggage 5. Go to transferring passengers luggage check-in counter but since I have an oversize item, I have to go to the Air Canada check-in counter. 6. Go to Air-Canada check-in counter * Wait in line 7. Get luggage checked again (it was done for the whole trip in NZ) 8. Drop the luggage at the giant x-ray machine 9. Go through check before security * Wait in line 10. Go through security 11. Have a beer (if you have any time left) because it took over 2 hours changing planes. Well Rene, its over. I'm an hour away from Montreal, flying away from the last light of the sunset. Back to Reality Base. Wonder if I've been away at all. Good thing I logged this journal to remind me that I was indeed away. I'm trying to write in French, but I keep switching back to English. Need practice to think in French. And go back to walking/driving on the right side! Really glad I spent some time with Matt and his family in Sydney and with my cousin in Christchurch. As always travelling by bike was a unique way of seeing the country. Dont bike the North Island. Take the bus or buy a van or rent a car for the North Island. The South Isalnd is a pleasant place to bike, beyond compare with the North Island. What else Rene? Wish ya caught a fish? Yeah, I guess so, but its OK. I learned quite a bit anyway. I'll practice nymphing and maybe I'll go back one day to settle the score. Long ways to go to catch a fish. I kinda regret that I did not go fishing with the chap from South Africa in Rotorua, but I could not stay. I was exhausted mentally and physically and wanted to go to the South Island ASAP. Meeting Angelika and Phil lifted my spirits and my stay in Christchurch was most healing. The riding from there was a blast. The stop in Te Awamutu leaves a nice funny feeling that when I think of it, just makes me smile. Cheers to all who came over to talk, gave me shelter, shared a few beers or slowed down to avoid running into me. As we are making our descent, I can see snowflakes on the airplane`s wing strobelights. Cool. So it is snowing. We are landing facing East. Hmmm... Easterly wind... Maybe this is the beginning of a snowstorm.  Dorval airport procedures: 1. Fill Customs form (on plane) * Wait in line 2. Go through customs 3. Wait for luggage (bike box took at least 20 minutes) 4. Go through customs with luggage. 5. Be greeted by friends. Now thats nice. And it is the beginning of a snowstorm. What timing.

51,
52,"About guides: There are a few cycling guides for NZ out there, the most recent ones being the Pedallers Paradise, North and South Islands, and Lonely Planet. Pedallers Paradise guides cover most of NZ roads, so where ever you are going, you will know what to expect gradient-wise, accomodation-wise, and sites of interest along the way. Also regularly updated (seems to be yearly lately). Both guides are the work of locals and since I like to root for the little guys, I travelled using the Pedallers Paradise guides. I do not regret it at all. The PEdallers PAradise guides may be hard to find, but can be ordered. Check the website at www.paradise-press.co.nz/ppguides.html Lonely Planet cycling guide to NZ has a lot of background info on cycletouring that you dont need if experienced. Does not cover all roads but suggested rides. I did use this guide to find out more about attractions and places to cycle, but did not bring it with me. Since I did not have a fixed itinerary, LP did not fit the bill. I did carry the regular NZ Lonely Planet guide for additional information, useful for general bakground information (sights, history, accomodation and orientation in big cities)."
53,"The North Island: Heavy traffic, narrow, winding, steep roads, logging trucks, some excellent but also some quite ordianry scenery, omnipresent radiata pine plantations (including massive clearcuts) make for a nerve-wrecking experience and not always rewarding scenery. I'd recommend biking a few days here and there on the island (EX: Coromandel in the off season; the East Cape, excluding the road from Opotiki to Gisborne - nice but dangerous). I would definately not recommend biking the whole island. Met a man who did so and the experience was so unpleasant that he decided to buy a car for the South Island. Big mistake. The South Island: Bike it. Enjoy the scenery, the passes, the montains, the sea... Beware of winds, rain, sandflies, Christchurch traffic and dont bike from Te Anau to Milford Sound (but do go down that road!).  If you plan a 6-week biking trip in NZ, I'd bike 4 weeks on the South Island and either do two 1-week loops on the North Island or rent a vehicle and forget about the biking."
54,"I used a touring bike and it did a great job, but its easier to find parts for a mountain bike. Tires: I'd recommend wide tires (35's) for the roads can be quite rough (chipseal) and sometimes the nicest road is the dirt road. Water: Carried two water bottles and an often handy extra 1-liter bottle in panniers. There can be long stretches between safe water supplies. Summer weather can be very hot in places. Maps: I like good maps so I know where I am at all times. The Automobile Association has good free maps - but you have to be a member or know a member ;). The Minimap series is also good. I used both. Mirror: YES! (Mounted on the right side!) Helmet: Its the law (150 $ fine) and I met poeple that got a warning from the police for not wearing a helmet. Also very useful if pedalling during magpie nesting season. Be visible: I must be getting old, but it helped knowing that I was visible when hearing a logging truck coming from behind (wore a safety vest). And if ever something does happen, like an accident (believe me, it can!), well you can say that you did your share by being visible."
55,       Do you have a Four-Square mascot picture? Send it over and we can start a unique gallery!
56,"Ice cream. On the East Cape I once saw a quite imposing (physically and visually) maori bloke with his girl walk into a dairy to come out a few moments later, each quietly licking an ice cream cone. That image stuck as the uniting power of NZ ice cream. Music. May it be any work of the Finn Brothers, Rhombus, 8-Foot Sativa, Betchadupa... kiwis like their local music and the music scene is quite alive. Sports. Cricket. Rugby. Wear black and the silver fern or die. Tidyness."
57,"27th November More bike rambling stuff, plus all the East Cape 20th Novemebr - rounded off the Coromandel section, and added the East Cape. A couple more entries in the bike giberings too. 8th November: Added the books and bike gibberish sections. And added the last bits to bring me out of the Coromandel and into Tauranga (where I am sat right now) 7th November: FINALLY got round to catching up the journal. Added the section from Rotorua to Castlerock, and also the Coromandel section."
58,"books - this is really just for me, i want to keep a track of what books I read on the trip  bike gibberings - there's lots of random things that i want to write about that aren't really related to any specific occasion. These live here. I'll probably add to them as things come to me over the trip.
"
59,"The most immediate is the menatal jukebox. Everyday some random song will be in your head. Where it comes from is anyone's guess, but there it is, on repeat for hour after hour. It's a fun thing, because it's often some rarely thought of song, and it'll take you back to other times and other places.  Also, I find I can press the mental Skip button and link from that track to another one, linked somehow by some memory. Even dafter, I've found I can replay whole movies. It's a kind of mental game, I try and think of a film or TV show I've watched a few times, and try to replay every scene. It's amazing how much you can remember of classic films. Alarmingly the only one I am really confident I have remembered virtually every scene of is The Comic Strip's More Bad News. But it kept me happy for most of an afternoon's riding. Sometimes a conversation in the evening will reming me of a good film, and I make a mental note to ""watch"" it the next day. The one 'movie' that is easiest to replay is the one I star in. I can pick whole periods of my life and see what I dredge up. And it's incredible what memory's you find lurking around. I spent days mentally walking through my old school, and thinking about what I may have done in each classroom over my years at SGS. In fact, as I write, I've still only done half the buildings there! I guess this all sounds a little odd, but there's only so long you can pedal for and keep on looking at the scenery - sometimes it's good to tour your brain, get the grey matter exercised as well."
60,"What?! I wobbled a bit, and looked round to see a magpie rearing away from me. It had basically swooped into my helmet and I think it reared away right at the last minute. Little bugger. Chatting to other tourers, and reading the journals on this site, it turns out this is a common experience. I'd never have thought that as well as watching out for the trucks you'd have to beware of birds too."
61,"Pushing off is a one-second flurry. Leg over the saddle, one foot clipped in, and push the bike, trying to get the slightest bit of momentum going in order to clip the other foot in and complete a pedal stroke. Fail that and you come to a halt pretty speedily. And if you're leaning over to one side at all at no speed, the whole she-bang lists sideways, and becomes a beached-whale affair that requires some big muscle to put upright again. Steering is like pushing the bars through treacle - very unresponsive. Gearing is a big change from the unladen bike. The granny is my friend - almost as soon as the gradient heads skywards, any momentum is lost, and whatever speed you had going down the hill is lost. Undulating roads therefore become a parade of high-speed top gear hurtles followed by 7 or 8 kph granny grunts.  After riding laden for a few days, getting back on an unladen bike is freaky - everything is just so responsive! THe first time I rode unladen after five days laden I nearly fell over due to the ridiculously responsive steering."
62,"And then you pass a field full of cows, and they ALL look at you with a look that appears to show interest but really you know they're only thinking ""Hmmm, funny human thing on funny contraption. Ah well, must eat more grass when he's out of view."" Wierd."
63,"And the roads aren't always very wide.  And they hurtle at 90-100kph.  And man, they are damn scary. They almost always give you plenty of room, but even then, it's pretty freaky to hear one of these beasts coming up behind you and then feel the buffetting effect as it passes by. All over in a flash, but you never really get used to it. Well, I haven't yet, after nearly four weeks..."
64,"Plus, every descent, every town, every view, is earnt by your own grafting. Coming over the top of a long climb and seeing a new vista opening up is a reward to savour, not just another view to snap."
65,"I've seen beer and wine sold at an 'Of-license.' Tills that will provide 'receets on request.' And plenty of their/there, it's/its blunders. I dunno. Education today, eh? I blame the government. Or somebody."
66,
67,"Here's the deal so far: - HEAVEN - the sections of baby-bottom smoothness, where the bike runs silently and without a single vibration. Not very common. - JIGGERY - probably the most common, coarse gravel tighly taramcced in, it's not particularly rough, but you feel it all the same. And after 6 or 7 hours of it, it does become a tad tedious - POPCORN - when the jiggery stuff gets really hot, the tarmace expands through in little bubbles. As you ride over it, there's a continous series of popping sounds, just like corn popping. - AMPLIFIER - really this is jiggery when riding in a tailwind. It makes every approaching vehicle sound ten times bigger and faster and closer than it really is, which makes for some pretty nervy riding. I've yet to come up with words for the other kinds (gravel, etc) And before you think I'm crazy, I've got to keep myself occupied, ok?!"

70,"I come to New Zealand and here they all are. There's pinballs all over the place, some old favourites, and some new to me. It's a joy to rediscover old machines and see if I can still catch the skill shots or the ramps. I am still to find a copy of the Batman pinball machine, which was the one I pumped the most money into, eventually being able to last about 20minutes on one game. When I do, I'll be staying there for a while! [heh heh, how sad is it to link to a site that has a picture of the batman pinball machine?!]"
71,"I've never understood why some people (men) think it is impressive to purchase a car that makes a lot of noise and moves from a standing start really fast. How is that impressive? What does it prove? To me, it shows that, well, you've got a lot of money to spend. And that you can multitask well - I mean, it's clearly very skillful to move the gearstick, release the clutch and press the accelerator all at the same time. Wow! You're something special. Not. Someone else built the car. Someone else designed the engine. Someone else mined the gasoline to power it. All you did was swoon over its shape, spend money on it, and put your Timberland shoes on the pedals.  Now, turning pedals quickly - THAT'S impressive. My power, my technique, my strength. ;)"
72,"""Lord of the RIngs: Return of the King"" What can one say - it is undoubtedly a masterpiece. However cynical i am about the whole thing - i mean, does it really take 10 hours of film to take a ring to a mountain - it's been a magic journey, and the effects and style of each film has been marvellous. Great fun. ""Crisis Four"", Andy McNab. Utterly utterly crap. ""The Robber Bride"", Margaret Atwood. More amazing stuff - if most women have the same ups and downs and opinions and hangups as the characters in her novels, then I think I have learnt more about the female species in reading two Atwood novels than in the rest of my life! ""Kill Bill - film. So, Tarantino's fourth film. Is he a cliche already or an original master? Well, I reckon he's a cliche. There's lots of exciting stuff in the film - some lovely shooting, and a few of the fight scenes are pretty amazing, but on the whole this was just a trundling vehicle, with no real excitement. Uma Therman though is gorgeous! ""Satin Rouge"" film. Tunisian cinema, eh? We all know and love it, and eagerly await the next blockbuster. Actually, I've never even heard of a Tunisian movie industry. Turns out this film is great though. A love triangle between a mother, daughter and belly dance club drummer, it's poignant and riddled with savage humour - the mother controls everyone throughout despite apparent vulnerability as she becomes a belly dancer herself. Great stuff. ""Love Actually"". It's so contrived - all the right buttons are pressed to create a romantic comedy. Completely unoriginal, and so packed full of The Best of English Romantic Comedy Actors And Actresses there's not even enough room for them all. The soundtrack is designed just to make a very thoughtful and imaginative Christmas gift CD for a loved one. And Hugh Grant at least twice looks into the camera, pauses, and says ""Right"". Just like he has done in his last 30 films. SO WHY THE HELL DID I ENJOY SUCH A NAUSEATINGLY SWEET FILM? I tried my hardest not to like it, but failed. And I just can't escape the fact that I think Hugh Grant is very funny. At least Rowan Atkinson was shit, just like always.  ""The Book of Eels"", Simon Fort. Yes, a book about eels. Amazing - did you know noone has ever bred an eel in captivity? Did you know all European and North American eels migrate from whichever stream they are in to the Sargasso Sea in the Atlantic to breed? But noone knows how they get there? And noone has ever seen them breed? And noone knows why some go one way and some go another? You didn't? Well, read this... ""The loneliness of the Long Distance Runner"", Alan Sillitoe A quick read, couldn't agree with the protagonist point of view, but the way he describes the joy of running is spot on, and just how i feel when out on a long bike ride. Mathstick Men (movie) Nic Cage is amazing. This film is by and large a pleasure to watch - touching and funny. Unfortunately the twist at the end is so crazy I felt it lost some of its credibility.  ""life Before Man"", Margaret Atwood Finally I read a book by Atwood. And about bloody time too. And it's great. She makes writing vivid prose seem easy - the clarity and choice of words is so perfect; I was forever double-taking as in one short concise sentence she would describe an emotion, a characteristic or a reaction in a surprising yet obvious way: ""his body hung off his spine"", ""it was like making love to a slab of Phildelphia cream cheese"". Great story of a bitter love triangle too.  ""Once Were Warriors"", Andy Duff. A tough book about a tough existende, this book hits hard. it portrays a tough existence for unemployed Maoris in this country, a lost culture, and a violent and demoralised set of people. It's very well written, and thankfully finishes with some enlightenment. It would be best to read in one go - I kept finsihing for the night at the end of some truly depressing passages! ""Matrix Revolution"" -  I really wish they had never bothered making any sequels to the Matrix. The first film amazed with its effects, and with its setting in an apparently normal world; the thrill of the film being in the abnormalities the Matrix allowed. The sequels however leave the Matrix itself and the film becomes yet another post-war-human-struggling-machines-industrial-blah-de-blah set of cliches. Knowing this, the producers clearly realised they needed to hide the unoriginality by making all the cityscapes BIGGER. The aliens FASTER and the music LOUDER.  I'm not fooled. This one concludes the trilogy, and does so with many many unoriginal ideas (APUs? Didn't we see those in Alien? Underground cities? War of the Worlds? etc). The Matrix figures fleetingly, and the directors are so without ideas they even repeat the excellent bank reception area shootout scene from the first movie in a nightclub. It's almost identical, right down to Trinity's cartwheeling, except with the really really exciting twist - the baddies can walk on the ceiling. Wow. And Morpheus. Oh man, he's dull. Let's play Morpheus Bingo: ""It is the way you choose that you shall follow"" ""There is no end, only continuity."" ""If you feel you are able, you shall be so"" ""What begins ends. After two sequels."" The script is just so corny. What began as an original concept finishes in this movie as a Star Wars good v evil rip-off. GRanted, the final scenes are pretty spectacular, but that counts less and less these days - special effects don't cover up for poor films anymore. Oh, and I had no idea what was going on either, the plot got so confused with it's cod philosophy it ceased to make any sense halfway through the second movie. And I also didn't understand the ending. ANyone care to explain? ""Dreamcatcher"", Stephen King Following the multi-day epic tramp that was Making of Memory, I figured I needed an afternoon stroll of a book to read. I haven't read a Stephen King book since It. But this is great. Rammed full of alien abduction cliches, this isn't anything particularly original, but King's bloody brilliant at writing stories that hook you in. I rattled through this in a couple of days, and enjoyed every one of its pop-trash pages. ""Making of Memory: From Molecule To Mind"", Steven Rose Some non-fiction, an explanation of the mind, and memory, and a history of scientific research into memory. This was a pretty tough read, but utterly captivating. Inevitably skewed towards his own research and opinions, Rose does a fantastic job of explaining some complex yet amazing biology. The mind is amazing, and a glimpse into how it functions only serves to emphasize just how amazing our minds are. The fact that our knowledge is still somehow pathetically limited - it's still a pretty unknown process - only enhances the amazement. There are lots of other insights into the more human side of the scientific process - arguments, trivialities, and humdrum realities of research - that make this a great book ""American Tabloid"", James Ellroy A thriller set in the 60s, the fiction is draped over the real events of the Cuba crisis and the Kennedy family's rise to fame. Ellroy's writing is pin-sharp and angry, but since I don't know enough about the real events of this period, I was never sure where the fiction met the fact, and for that reason it was on the whole a frustrating read.
"
73,"And my parents? Well, they have been touring the world incessantly it seems since they retired a few years ago, and I felt that it was about time the roles were reversed - it never seemed right that it was the children who should be worrying about the parents as they backpack around the globe. They can worry about me for a while! Their travels have been pretty inspirational though, a real show that anyone can do it. Where to go wasn't really that tough a choice. The US was tempting, but NZ is totally new to me, and it's reputation is as good as anywhere I know of. The plan is pretty vague - 6,7 or so months, ride everywhere, and get in as much mountain biking as I can while I am there. Enter some races, meet great people, and see some wild country. En route spend a week with old friends in California. Oh, and play some disc golf where I can."
74,"The highlight of the journey was the classic stereotype american couple I was sat next to who had just done a two week bus tour of the UK with other friends who were on the flght. They'd clearly been enjoying UK daytime TV while on their trip. Halfway through the flight, one of their friends came over and told them to watch channel 8 ""because Richard And Judy are on"". so they start watching it and tell me how much they loved the show. They didn't once realise they were actually watching Alastair McGowan's Impression show. Classic! the last I saw of the couple were them having an argument right next to the customs desk with the woman shouting ""I don't have a clue where the exit is, just find it quickly"". All in, door to door was about 20 hours. Wonderful! But as I got to the Roger's house, I was treated to a lovely meal, beer, and good company. And what should have been a long night's sleep to recover turned into about 3 hours, as the body clock was all confused."
75,"Bike geeks: Feeling like a munro bagger, i have managed to ride trails near Santa Cruz and Marin County. It's a tad wierd riding a trail that is better known in the UK as a bike model, but hey, Marin is ""where it all began"" right? I set off from Rebebcca's yesterday to tour the city and maybe head into Marin. I planned on doing an easy little ride. And returned home 50 miles later.  Something tells me I will have to temper my enthusiasm once I get to the full-on touring in the next few weeks. I rode fast and furious in an attempt to see everything. The city itself is great to ride round - there's lots of planned routes, and they are all signed at every intersection, so it isn't too difficult to get from place to place. And I hadn't quite thought about the SF hills. These streets are steep, man - real granny gear stuff. Wonderful! The Marin trails were pretty good. Lots of fire-road, but some killer views. The Santa Cruz trails (Skegg's point, if you're interested) was primo-singletrack. Mmmmm. Tough tough hills, but some wonderful descending. The only problem being that the parking lot was at the very top of the hill making the ride out the hardest bit of the day. Music geeks: Last night was Ween at Berkely Greek Theatre. Anyone who has known me for any length of time knows my pink Ween t-shirt (it used to be red, honest!). It was a bonus to be able to see them in SF, and what a fantastic venue.  Well, they did what Ween do - they rocked. It's getting a bit old now, but since they're so part of my past now, every song is great to hear live.  Disc Golf geeks: While here in SF, I felt I had to take advantage of the golf in the city. I played on Wednesday at the _weekly_ tournament, where 30 people entered. yes, a weekly golf tourny. Hard to believe the difference between the US and the UK. Here, disc golf is just another sport. The Berkeley Aquatic Park course I played on is one of the oldest in the world, built in 1978! And boy it was tough - half the holes involved drives over water, and with a really fierce wind, it made it even tougher. Check out hole 9!!. I was glad to not lose my one disc that I am travelling with (it's the singlespeed mentality in me, y'see!), and hold my own amongst some pretty good talent.  Tomorrow, a new course opens in Golden Gate Park, so I'm going to go down and get involved in that. Well, that's it for SF. I could really stay here for ages - it's a wonderful city, easy to get around and with lots to do. But, another flight beckons, and New Zealand is the aim of the trip; in 48 hours time, I'll be on the way..."
76,"I returned to Rebecca's house, and her parents were there with a friend. They wanted to go for a walk, so we decided to go to Folsom Street Fair. In its 20th year, don't you know. Street fair? So, lots of stalls, people, music, dancing, and general happiness, right? Well, yes, but this being San Fran, it had to be slighlty different. It's a leather fair. Which brings out all the boys, and girls, boys who look like girls, and girls who look like boys, in some pretty damn wierd garb. Butch leather boys, transexuals, mistresses, masters, slaves, naked men with piercings in places you wouldn't believe, various acts of bondage, a vast array of boobs bums and balls. i've never seen anything like it. do a Google search for Folsom Street Fair if you want an idea of the event, but don't do it at work...! and now it's off to NZ. Gulp! First night stay booked, and after that who knows. North or South. The tough but pleasant decisions of a traveller."
77,"After an eternal flight (but hey, I got the window exit seat so had oodles of leg room!), I arrived at the wonderful hour of 5am. To see my first Kiwi dawn. Which brought with it bitterly cold winds and ridiculously heavy showers. Which have continued all day. It hardly inspires enthusiasm for starting the tour, esp since the forecast is for several days of this. Well, it cannot really stop me, because I am here to ride!  I made me first tactical error by choosing a duff hostel. Nothing wrong with it, but someone recommended it as it was close to the airport. Sounds ok. But cloase to the airport means miles away from the city of Auckland, and instead of being in the hustle and bustle of the Kiwi gateway city I am in a nearly deserted hostel sharing with two other french people. Whoops. But retail therapy helped me through the day as I purchased all my required booty for the trip - BOB trailer, tent, cooking kit, and various other sundries rattled the credit card and soother the pain. I spent so much in one shop, not only did they give me a nice chunky discount, he even gave me a lift back to the hostel (a 45 min round trip!). That's really all I have done today - arrive, unpack the bike, buy some stuff. No chance to see Auckland yet, I'll do that tomorrow. As well as attempt to work out exactly where to go first. So much choice...."

79,"I got a bus ride to Brenderwyn, an hour north of Auckland, coz I didn't want to cycle out of the city. En route, the hostel owner, the shuttle driver, the ticket lady, and the bus driver all said the same thing: ""Have you seen the weather forecast? I wouldn't bother riding today if I was you."" The forecast was for a huuuge storm*, gale force winds and seas of rain. But this was day one of my epic tour, so how could I not set off?  And so, Andy finds himself at a cold bus stop, bike, bag and trailer, with 70km to the evening's destination, Dargaville.  1 Hitch trailer to bike. Check. 2 Put bag onto trailer. Hum, it doesn't fit.  3 Try again. Bike falls over. Curse.  4 Try again. Push squeeze, curse, in it goes. 5 Phew! 6 Point bike in general direction of travel to avoid unnecessary steering. 7 Wait until no cars or pedestrians are around in case one falls over. 8 Pedal (well, wobble). 9 Stop. Get allen keys out and straighten handlebars. 10 Repeat step 8 11. 100m later - why is bike wobbling horrifically? 12. Rehitch trailer to bike, this time actually closing the hooks so that the trailer doesn't end up hanging off your rear-mech. 13. Off we go. The first few k were really nervy - the bike was an undisciplined animal, and over the next few days it required some serious talking to make it behave properly. Downhills are interesting - for the first few k the bike wobbles like crazy. Uphills are interesting - it's bloody heavy. The flat bits are interesting too, mostly due to the crosswind that attempts to blow me into every passing camper van and monster truck that zooms past me, creating its own wobble-inducing bakcdraft. I bump into my first bike tourers - two guys with bikes and panniers. Now I'm a fully-fledged bike tourist with a whopping 43 minutes experience under my belt, I engage them in conversation. ""Where are you from?"" ""Spain. And you?"" ""England"" ""Very good. How long have you been touring?"" Trying to sound wordly in order to disguise my green gills, ""Er, well this is my first day. And you?"" ""Ah, four years, we started in Spain."" I nearly executed a stationary fall off my bike. Four years! I spend some time during the day thinking about that - they were on their bikes in Sep 2001 - I bet they have a completely different awareness of the world to us ""lucky"" souls who get to watch the news every day. After that, things trundled along quite happily. The bike was beginning to understand how it should behave, the wind was not too bad, and I even began to enjoy myself. With 30k to go, I turned to head North. Right into the wind. The next 30k were simply awful. The road was mostly razor-straight, giving me the wonderful pleasure of being able to see for miles and miles along the road, and for all the stuff in the distance NEVER to get any closer. And every little homestead had signs urging me to buy Kumara - a NZ sweet potato. I didn't want any bloody kumara. I was tired and cold and wet, and these signs only went to show how slow my progress was. I was averaging about 13kph for this stage of the ride. Grrr. Finally, I reached Dargaville. I had planned to camp. So, being stubborn, and despite the rain, I thought I would stick to the plan. Touring rule number 5 - always practise putting your tent up somehwere dry. Don't put it up for the first time in the wind and the rain. That's another rule broken then. Finally, tent up, I can relax. Well, if you can say getting cramp everytime you move inside the tent to undress, unpack, or enter or exit the tent is relaxing, then yes, I relaxed. By now, the wind is even stronger, and it rains constantly through the night. When I wake up, the ground is completely saturated, and there's standing water about 2ft from my tent.  A fine day's cycle touring then. It's perversely been quite fun - a challenge, for sure, but tempered by the Zen thing - you've got to take the bad with the good to get the best out of your time on the bike. That's what I have been telling myself anyway. * (check out this for some news on the weather.
"
80,"This is the way to tour. I arrived at the hostel in a mere 2.5 hours. How great is that? Kaihu Farm is a magic hostel - small, with its own bush walks, run by a really friendly Dutch couple. Recommended to anyone heading this way. In the hostel, I met up with Fran and Stan, a pair of Belgians who had camped in Dargaville last night, too - they made the same decision as me: a short day, and a nice warm bed. They're travelling in a car, which also seems quite appealing now! Also, there was Fumi - Japanese guy, who has walked from Dunedin (in the very South of New Zealand) over the last 8 months, always walking on the road side, and using a golf trolley to carry his stuff. And an umbrella when it rains. We all think he's crazy, as does he, but that's the best bit of it - there's no reason why anyone should bother doing a ""normal"" trip - even my bike tour is relatively ""normal"".  The four of us drive up the road to Trounson Kauri park (avoiding some landfalls that have blocked soome of the approach roads). Kauri, eh? New to me, they're bloody big trees, basically. Really, they are amazing. Some of the ones I've seen over the days are 2000+ yrs old, are about 5 or 6m in diameter, and are pretty inspiring sites. Alas, most have been logged and now make very pretty tables in places around New Zealand."
81,"Today's highlight is right at the end of the day after the toughest climb yet; reaching the top of Pakia Hill, I get a view into Hokianga Harbour. To the left, the Tasman Sea, grey and white and very active. Straight ahead, towering sand dunes, hundreds of feet high, many kilometres long. To my right, the harbour itself, calm and lined with forested hills. It the first big contrast of landscapes I've had, so I take a while to savour it before the descent to Opononi (WORLD famous for its friendly dolphin in the 50s apparently) for the night.
"
82,"And a tailwind. At last. Even some sunshine. This touring thing's getting better every day! I got the ferry across Hokianga harbour, and set off on the most remote section of the tour yet. The road's good, and the landscape is mostly farmland, but there's just no people. Or cars. It almost starts getting to me after a while. But, it's a nice day, and, er, um, I decide to start singing to pass the time. I've been talking to myself a little over the last few days, but the singing really entertains me. I can only imagine how far my descent into madness will be as this tour continues - I expect I'll be like the Ancient Mariner when I return - ""stop, young man, let me tell you a story..."" The ride gets prettier as I go through er, a gorge. I can't remember its name. Great guide I'd make... But, it was lovely. Honest.  Six hours later, I'm in Kaitia. Tomorrow is a rest day, I'm going to Cape Reinga at the almost-furthest-North point of New Zealand.  I'm loving it!"
83,"I rode my bike this evening unladen for the first time since starting the trip. I almost fell off it was so light and twitchy! I've only camped once so far. The hostels are so nice and inviting. And dry. Must camp more - otherwise I'm carrying all this bloody camp stuff for nothing. People are fab. The travellers I have met so far have been great, all with their own eccentricities. And the hostel owners are all very entertaining too. I'm in Kaitia now, which feels like a big town after the remoteness of the last few days (with it's whopping 4800 population!). I already miss the slower pace of life of villages made up of about 10 houses.
"
84,"This was my first time in NZ doing some of the conveyor belt tourism - get on a bus, be taken along to some places on the way, stop and take a photo, and then come home again, having ""experienced"" the region. Well, that was my cynical view before we started, but I guess I should just learn to chill out a little - it was a great tour with Sand Safaris. Our Maori driver was refreshingly loopy, dropping in plenty of off-the-wall comments through the day, as well as singing us some songs as he drove.  The stops were pretty great on the way too - more Kauri shops, a wonderful bay or two, but the unexpected highlight was Gumdiggers park. A vast amount of New Zealand was dug up in the 19th century as prospectors dug for Kauri gum (in the Northern Hemisphere, we know it as amber). The gum would be sold and used in varnishes, linoleum, and other oily based products. The gumdigger's life was pretty grim, living in remote areas, digging holes in peaty ground day after day. There used to be masses and masses of this gum, remains from anceint fossilised Kauri forests, buried underneath the soil. There is a huge industry here where not only did they dig for gum, they could also recover enormous Kauri trunks that have been perfectly preserved for up to 50 thousand years. Noone really knows why the Kauri forests died, but they reckon it was caused by huge tsunamis.  All in all, a geographere's wet dream, then! At the gumdiggers park, instead of selling the land to the loggers who will recover the buried wood, the owners have tried to recreate a digger's camp. I had low expectations for this part of the tour, but it blew me away - the window on the life of these people, the vision of the owners to preserve the history, and the sights in the forest, the highlight being a 30ft wide buried Kauri tree base that the owner is slooowwwwwllyy digging out by hand. Highly recommended to anyone visiting.... The Cape itself was beautiful, and I was pretty fortunate that finally the sun was shining. Seeing the Tasman and Pacific oceans meeting each other was pretty special, you can really see the difference in the characters of the ocean, and the waters look pretty turbulent from the cliffs above.
"
85,"After a leisurely start, I had a chat with some Maori weavers who were making flax mats to cover their Marae. There was one Maori fellow, and a couple of young women all working away with the flax. Apparently the basket making skills are really becoming popular down here with kiwis from all backgrounds, pretty much just as all aspects of Moari culture are. I kind of wanted to have a go at using flax, but they were pretty focussed on what they were doing. I think that once I get into the Maori heartlands of the Coromandel and the East Cape I should have more opportunity to get involved. (for those who don't me, one of my hobbies back home is basketmaking....!) Leaving the relaxed confines of the weavers behind, I put my still-weary legs over the bike, and set off on my day's riding. The weather had reverted to form by now. Wind and some rain. Joy. I also knew something was up because I didn't really feel at all enthused on the bike. The farmland was getting tedious, the trailer felt heavier, and my destination seemed very distant. The end result of this feeling was me deciding to call it a day after only 35km and stop over at Manganui instead.  Anyone who knows me probably realises that I didn't make this decision lightly - I mean, my god, if I start a ride, I damn well finish it, even if I'm bonking like mad, the legs are tired, and the weather's crap. But, no, this was part of my slipping into touring mode - it doesn't matter where I end up. And it turned out to be a great decision. Manganui's a lovely little village on a secluded bay, and it has the GREATEST fish and chips anywhere. Freshly caught fish, cooked on demand, with oh-so-golden chips. Mmmmm.
"
86,"It's really miserable and beginning to get a bit boring really. I've only had one day of fine weather so far, and I wasn't on the bike that day... It's an uneventful day though. The bus did go down the Bay Of Islands coastline, which promised views of wonderful little islands, deep bays, and fine beaches. All I saw was rain and grey. Ho hum. But I reach Whangarei and cycle the short distance to David's house, and begin to get into race mode..."
87,
88,"The whole process from the company's point of view is pretty simple - get the clients to the airport, in the air, back down to ground, sell them lots of 'extras', and send 'em home. The whole process takes less than two hours, giving a huge turnaround of punters to fill their coffers. That isn't meant to sound cynical because the operation is extremely slick, and everyone working there knows just how to enhance the fear/excitement that everyone is feeling from the moment they leave the hostel to the final return to earth. That's from their perspective. But for the jumpers, this is a HUGE thing. We didn't evolve to fall out of planes at 15000ft. My mind keeps telling me it's not right.  After the briefest of ground-training - 'head back, legs back when we fall out of the plane' - it's strap-up time, and into the plane we go. I was with Chris and Jo, who were jumping at 12000ft. I chose to spend that little bit extra to go at 15000ft giving me 60 seconds of free fall at 200kph. 15000ft! Think about that next time you're flying in a plane; I can't wait to watch the altimeter in the seat-back telly and think to myself, 'Heh, heh, I JUMPED at this height!' The flight up is quick, and at 12000ft out the plane went Chris and Jo. I then had a couple more minutes to contemplate what was happening. I wasn't at all nervous, but I was very excited. Tandem-master shows me the altimeter - 15000ft - and shuffles me out to the edge of the plane. Meanwhile our cameraman nonchalantly stands on the OUTSIDE of the plane to film the start of the jump. How weird is that?  A quick look back to the camera, and out we go. Really, there is simply no way to describe the feeling of falling out of a plane. There's no real sensation of 'falling' - you're too high up to feel that. Instead, every sense is bombarded. Visually and aurally there's so much going on, and your mind just can't process it quickly enough - this is all completely new, and it is simply not possible to absorb it all. There's also the completely whacky sensation of wind in your face, flapping your cheeks all over the place. And the cameraman is there, coming right up to you, holding your hands, spinning you round, backing off again, coming back in again.  All too soon, the tandem-master opens the chute, and things return to some form of normality. Things go quiet, and you can appreciate the amazing view of Lake Taupo and surroundings. A few bits of stomach turning parachute acrobatics, and one minute later you've landed safely, and can then giggle and scream and hug the other guys from the plane. Apparently my freefall lasted 60 seconds and we did some spins. However, my memories of it are a confused mush of excitement, fear, amazement, and complete joy; there's no sequence to the memory, just a warm glowing recollection of something incredible. Everyone should do this! Photos of my rubber cheeks at: fotopic
"
89,"I'm in NZ to bike tour, and prior to the race had been getting wet riding in Northland. Fortunately, one of my team mates, Dave, lived up in Whangarei so the plan was to meet at his house, and drive down to Taupo on the Friday in his parents' campervan, get there early, set up camp, drink some beers, and meet some riders. Basically, the obligatory pre-race chill out. That was the plan A at any rate. Our departure was delayed for four hours, as we had to fix the windscreen wipers on the van. A search around a wrecker's yard was required to find the correct motor. No problem, we'd hopefully still be there by 8pm. That was plan B, soon also destined to fail. As we got closer to Taupo, the rain got worse (this was becoming the norm for my experience of NZ so far. Rain. And wind.) And then, 20km from town, as we rounded a corner, the van slewed left, then right, and we heard the disheartening flap-flap-flap of a flat tyre. Plan C was immediately created and put into action - it entailed this: curse a lot, fail to be able to remove spare tyre from underneath the van, wait until someone stops to help us, get them to give one of us a ride into town to get a spare tyre, drive back to the van along the WRONG highway, return to Taupo, go out of town again on the correct highway, fix tyre, and eventually crawl into Taupo after midnight, cold, wet, tired, and $250 poorer.  Finally I could meet the whole of my team, but since we were all tired and grumpy, the greetings were pretty cursory.  Waking up to the familiar sound of hundreds of people fettling with bikes that are already working perfectly, it was time to get up and face rest day. My team-mates all turned out to be great people, and our race strategy was formed - ride as hard as you want, and have fun. The race format was pretty simple and familiar to me - ride as many laps as possible in the available time; 12 hours in this race. Nearly 3000 riders were entered in teams of 5.  The route was the highlight of this race. Half of the lap was singletrack through the woods. Not particularly technical but flowing and enough to keep your mind focussed. The second half was through a paddock, through all the team campsites. In the UK, we have tend to have a small changeover area, and camping is largely separated from the route. Here however, every team's campsite was also its pit/handover area. This gives the rider about 1km of heckling and people spotting to indulge in. And when you're not riding, the race continues right in front of your tent. A visionary idea and a massive highlight of the race. Another highlight was the 10.30am start. Liam, our super-competitive rider (possibly even more competitive than me!) volunteered to start. In the UK, we start these mass races with a run in order to spread the field a little. In NZ? Nah, that's far too soft. Start 'em all together and laugh as 500 riders hit the first piece of singletrack together. There was much crunching of gears, cursing, dropped chains, and collisions to keep us all happy as we watched the start. Fortunately within a lap or two the field spread out and traffic was not a major issue. The next 12 hours became a familiar joyous team-race. Sprint hard for your lap (around 20min), return out-of-breath, relax, meet some other teams, encourage your team mates, wander round the expo area, and soak up the atmosphere. Repeat as necessary until the end of the race. As to be expected, there were teams taking things very seriously, teams there to ride hard with no aim of winning (us), teams on silly bikes, unicyclists, fancy dress (props to the Super Hero team). I rode two of the laps towing my BOB trailer, which was lots of fun, plus went to show just how amazing those things are off-road; apart from the slight weight, I was barely aware it was there. And amazingly, as the race continued, our team remained solidly in the top 20 of our category. Not bad for a cobbled together team!  As evening drew in, the lights came out, and the drizzle started. Fortunately the drizzle never got to heavy, so the course didn't really deteriorate. As ever, the night laps were great fun, and a great opportunity to boost ones places, as it always seems that most people are uncomfortable in the dark. Personally, I seem to ride as fast in dark; I think the fact that I can't see the trails so well makes me more not less confident! As the 10.30 finish approached, things got a little frantic as some teams tried to squeeze in one more lap. But once 10.30 passed, that was it. A pretty elaborate prize-giving ceremony closed proceedings, and many people drifted home. But a good selection, including ourselves, stayed to celebrate and drink to new friends, good riding, and five pairs of non-broken bikes and bodies! The Day/Night Thriller was a cracking event, well-organised, and as a visitor to the country, a great introduction to the racing scene over here. I can't wait for the next race  Photos at: Day Night Thriller photos
"
90,"Fergus and I ride out from Taupo along the new mountain bike track to Hiaku Falls. These falls are something else. A huge meandering river wends its way slows to Lake Taupo, only to be constricted into a 12m wide, 10m deep gorge for about 500m. The result is a violent flow of bright-blue water emerging at the end of the gorge via a 7m waterfall, and a bubbling cauldron of sky blue and white water. From the falls, it's a short ride to the trails. With no need for a map, it's an area you can just follow your nose in. Head up the forest road until you see a trail heading off, and see where you end up. We spend about 4 hours on trails such as the Tourist Trap, Bumble Bee, Fast Eddy, Stage Fright, Stage Left.  My favourite was the Corkscrew, a trail right up the side of the mountain, steep switchback after steep switchback requiring you not only maintain traction with precision weight positioning, but also demanding some determined pedalling to get the bike round each rooty turn. It took me a couple of goes to complete this, but it was such a well designed challenge I felt almost obliged to clear it.  The reward for going up the hill was a straight-down descent - no turns, no rocks, just extremely steep. So steep I actually bottled out halfway and didn't really feel an urge to go back up and try again! We finished our exploration with the Buzzard trail, a massive descent similar to those in Glentress - lots of switchbacks with deep rain-ruts in them, forcing you into one line choice only with no room for error. It was white-knuckle stuff, and the fire-road at the bottom was a very welcome sight!
"
91,"That said, I did meet some great people, and we did end up going out til late at the local Irish bar, Mulligans! From Taupo, next stop was Rotorua, 80km away. When the day to leave Taupo came around, it turned out the guys I skydived with, and their other car-buddy, Lindsay (who knows Andy Tucker and Sammy from back home!), were all heading to the same hostel in Rotorua that day. Hurrah - they took all my gear, leaving me with just my bike to get to the town. This made for a pleasant and pretty simple ride that day. It was also the first day I'd 'toured' for a week, and I wasn't even carrying my gear!  There was a girl at the Rotorua Hostel who had seen my arrive at Rainbow Lodge in Taupo with all my kit in a Ute, and now she saw me arrive at Rotorua with just a bike, and someone else driving my gear to the hostel. I don't think she was very impressed!
"
92,"I rode this route with Fergus, a road racer from Cork in Island. He's a top bloke, Irish to the core, and had the hardest to understand accent I have come across in years - for the three days we rode together I continually asked him to repeat just about everything (sorry about that, Fergus, if you're reading this!). We were shuttled to the start of the ride by a true mountain man, huge and bearded, who was off hunting later that day.  The start of the ride was in view of Mount Ruapehu, and Tongariro national park. We were blessed with completely clear skies, and wonderful views of the snow covered volcanic peaks in the National Parks. Before coming to New Zealand I was told often that the colours in NZ really are spectacular, and it is totally true - it seems like the country has been saturated in order to make all the views that more intense with colour. On paper, the route looks like a breeze - starting at 900m and finishing at 450m, the overall descent would surely make this a fun downhill blast. Wrong - there's a lot of climbing in this ride! The first few kilometres are benign doubletrack offering amazing views of the mountains around, including Mt Taranaki, the Mt. Fuji-like volcano over 150km to the West.  The track now descends very steeply to Waione stream, right down at 500m. This is the best descent of the day. It's about 6 ft wide, but with treacherous ruts, rocks, and hard-packed sandstone which is shaped into countless steps and potholes by the run-off from recent rains.  The descent is about 4km long, and requires 100% concentration, dropping the bike carefully into each depression, keeping the weight correctly balanced to ensure you get out again. It's pretty relentless with ruts followed by few steps, followed by drop-off, followed by off-camber turns. This concentration is accompanied by big grins, however, as each successfully passed obstacle ramps up the adrenalin, and makes you more determined to get to the bottom without dabbing. Fergus, who has not been mountain biking for long, but is very fit, was also enjoying the challenge, this baptism by fire forcing him to hone some serious handling skills pretty quickly. The track surface suddenly becomes pretty kind, but the gradient steepens, and the final stretch to the stream is an arse-on-the-tire slide. In the UK, we build bridges over most streams. Here, there's not enough people or passing traffic to justify that so stream crossings are part of the NZ mountain biking experience. I had been a little apprehensive about these, but the Waione stream crossing in front of us was only about 8ft across, and not deep. Hah! This is the best the hard-nut Kiwis can give us? Over the stream, up a bit, and down again to another crossing of the stream. Ok, this is a bit bigger, maybe 15ft, not cyclable, and the water comes up to our calves. Still, it's not that hard. Over another hump, and all become clear. 50ft away is the trail. In between is a rather serious looking river. Lots of water, and it certainly isn't going slowly. Fergus nominates me to go first as I have more mountain biking experience. I'm not entirely sure how this qualifies me for river crossing but it seems fair enough. It's all fun and games until the water's up to my upper thighs and I'm yet to reach halfway. And it's ball-shrinkingly cold. I do reach the other side without mishap however, and feel pretty happy to have done my first proper river traverse! Fergus has shorter legs than me, so the water gets even higher on him. Thank god it's a gorgeous day, I wouldn't like to do this ride in cold and rain; we dry off within 10minutes of setting out to climb back out of this valley. The remainder of the ride consists of bush riding surrounded by beautiful palms, ferns, tea trees, and other NZ flora I've yet to identify, all in vivid shades of green and brown. There's the occasional vista of the surrounding mountains, and each climb is rewarded by a larger descent. The descending tracks have natural banking on the turns, so you can just push it that little bit harder each time, skimming over the rocky surface and sketching it around the turns. There's a fair few washed-out sections, and deep ruts to keep you hyper-aware - one missed braking turn, and you could end up  broken a long way down the valley. We reach Owhango 4 hours later, after the final huge river crossing. The grins are large, and the post-ride beers very satisfying as we'd survived a tough day in remote bush conquering one of the tough rides this marvellous country has to offer.
"
93,"For evening entertainment, it was off to a night of Maori culture at Mitai. A strange night, really. On the one had, I got to learn a vast amount about Maori culture, but I couldn't help feeling that it somehow feels intrusive, or fake, as the Maoris put on a 'show' of their culture. Overall, it was a great night, but there's a niggling feeling of guilt that this is the way most tourists find out about local culture. I do hope that once I get to the more remotes areas of the East Cape that I'll be able to get a bit more into the truer aspects of the people. Leaving the marae, we all went out drinking. Man, I'm getting too old for this! A great night, but the rest of the people I was with were all under 25. They keep on knocking the beers back - it's a relentless pace. Eeee, when I was a lad, I could do that, but, blimey, I couldn't keep up with these guys. By 3am rolled around, and they were talking about going to the local strip bar to carry on, I had drunk myself sober and managed to crawl home. We did have a good old boogy at the bar we spent most of the night in, and that was excellent. I woke up in hangover hell though. Ugh. My final stay in Rotorua is at friends of the Rogers family, Ali. A cosy little house outside Rotorua, I've been relaxing, taking advantage of using a REAL towel instead of a poxy lightweight cotton thing, and sleeping in a double bed. Joyous!
"
94,"Today, I'm riding with Kurt, a Swiss guy I met on the road from Taupo to Rotorua. He's also done a lot of MTB racing in his time, and over the day he really takes me to school with his fitness and handling skills. It's quite humbling really! The Redwoods contain the best purpose-built trails I've ever ridden on. Despite being confined over small area, there's a maze of trails, all well-signed, and all with different characters. The dense network gets you really disorientated and despite sometimes being aware that you're just going round in circles, the trails are a delight.  Some are a roller-coaster of sharp climbs followed by bermed twisty descents with plenty of BSX jumps. Others are technical climbs, with step-ups, roots and switchbacks to manoeuvre the bike over. Others are complete scribbles on the map, a flat yet relentless series of non-banked turns around seemingly every tree in the woods - these trails are blast to try and push the bike to the limit, trying to maintain speed around each turn, the maximum enjoyment being extracted when you nail a series of turns in succession, and still have lots of momentum. One of the toughest, Pedro's Trail, spins its way between dense trees, slowly rising before throwing us into a descent with huge rooted sections, with large steps in the turns. This one's a real giggle because there's no room for error, going over the bar is going to land you on some lumpy bits of tree. After an hour or so of playing on these trails Kurt has the bright idea of heading to the far side of the forest to the National Downhill Course. Now, I like to stick to my XC roots, and am a little apprehensive, but hey, NZ's all about the adrenalin rides, right? Well, Kurt rode a pretty good chunk of the course. But I walked more than I rode. It did give me a new respect for downhillers; how they ride this stuff, and at speed, is beyond me. The course in Redwoods is steep, has some scary jumps, where the exit is a narrow gap between tree trunks, and enormous drop-offs.  After that little hike, we returned to the car park via the forest's Exit Trail - the most technical of the day. By now, my confidence was high, and this trail was a peachy finish. The beginning is a series of huge bermed corners and tabletops and finished with 500m of roots to drop the bike down. It's a tough finish to the day, but get down it in one piece, and you'll be buzzing all the way home. If you ever visit NZ with a bike, this is one place you have to come to!
"
95,"I needed to head off to the shops in Rotorua, a couple of blocks from the hostel. On the bike I go and at the junction, put the weight on the pedals to get onto the main road. Next thing I know I am sprawled all over the main road, something really didn't go right there.  Gather myself together, scrapes on the knees and elbow, more shaken than broken (I did fall over into the middle of a main road - lucky nothing was coming).  When I got home I noticed the rear sprockets had completely come loose - I have no idea how a sprocket can work loose, but it had, and when I went to push on the pedals, the sprockets worked loose, which led to my collapse onto the road.  Ho hum. Still in one piece, and the bike is now fixed 
"

98,"There was no recommended route from Rotorua to Castlerock, so the Lonely Planet book was packed away, and out came the road map. Which was actually liberating - instead of knowing what each day has  in store for me, suddenly I have no idea of the state of the roads, the route profile, or where I will stay that evening. The first day's target was to reach a camp site in the tiny town of Tokoroa. En route I went through a lovely gorge. I stopped to take a photo of my bike with the gorge in the background, only to lean against a fence as I was taking the photo. BzzzzzzZZZZT! Electric bloody fence. No sign. But then, why would there be inthe middle of nowhere? Andy becomes a little wiser.  I reached Tokoroa only to find that the campsite had been shut down for ""illegal"" operations. All very mysterious but it left me with a problem. The info centre guy could only find the nearest hostel or campsite a further 40km away. My body had already mentally shut down for the day so that was not a good prospect.  ""But, we do have one or two B+B options, sir. They're only about $40 a night."" Forty dollars, I thought? That's way above my budget  -the hostel's are only between 12 and 20 a night. Then I converted it back to pounds and realised just how cheap that still was by UK standards. Off I went to Mike's B+B. Not so much a B+B as 'staying at a guy's house'. More home comforts in a beautiful wee house. Mike was a really nice oldish bloke, but he could talk for his country. I had my evening meals with him too (all in the whopping 40 dollar price!) and basically just let him go off on monologues that may start on the subject of worm farming (honestly) and end up about geology of Northern Canada, having gone through politics, sport and religion on the way. With nothing more than a ""mmm"" or ""yes"" from me..."
99,"I boldly walked into the first cycle shop and chatted with the owners, Warren and Debbie. Almost straight off, I asked if they knew anyone who could show me the trails. Immediately, Warren said he could do it - do I want to go now? Amazing! The friendliness of this place is always refreshing. And so off we went. Warren only had time to show me some of the 30km of trails, and I would explore the rest on my own. The region around Tokoroa is pretty incredible. Imagine the Teletubbies landscape - vivid blue skies and vivid green rounded hills. Not too big, but lumpy enough. Now throw some enormouse boulder around for some variety. That's the topography. At Big Rock (there's a very big rock next to it) the forestry people have planted a huge pine forest and it's in there that the trails are built. Which allows for a pretty unique cycling experience. There's no long climbs and no long descents, instead the whole network is a non-stop up and down ride. After a couple of hours I was truly knackered. The terrain never lets you recover, always requiring one more lung stretching climb. The trails weren't the best, they were all a bit too samey really: very twisty, no variation of the surface (light soil covered in pine needles and cones) and the best of the descents were just straight down, rutted chutes. Still, it's good to get the fat tyres out, and I think that having just come from Redwoods I was a little bit spoiled at the time! I'd still love to have something as good as this on my doorstep at home. Oh wait, I've got the Chilterns which are actually quite similar! Warren left me after an hour, and I still had two trails, Dirty Harry and Alien, to do. Dirty Harry first - this one broke me completely. The ups were seriously up, and I bonked completely. Also, riding unfamiliar singletrack on your own just isn't fun - there's noone to push you on, and the voice in your head is amplified big time: if you fall and hurt yourself here, noone's going to find you for a while...  All this leads to a lot of bailing out of sections, and a general lack of enthusiasm. Which was the last attitude you need to ride the Alien. This is mega-technical and even though I was tired and walking the scarier bits, was the most fun in the forest. Clearly built by hand (the other trails were bulldozed), this handlebar width trail snaked up and down the bumps but also over rocks, roots and in a crazy zig-zag that required serious arm-work to keep the bike pointing in the right direction. Some sections were insane, and tough even to walk, but I emerged in one piece, happy to finish with that trail.  Another bike park in the bag, then! Big Rock's due to be felled next year, so these trails are almost gone, but the local club has secured another forestry area to build more trails on next year. So, this will remain a place to visit!"
100,"What a place! More teletubby hills, but the rocks here are incredible. Castlerock is a climbing mecca in New Zealand, with over 250 routes near the lodge. There's also countless bouldering opportunities. The lodge a wonder in itself. In the middle of nowhere (not good as I cycled here with no food....), surrounded by the biggest of the crags, it's a little palatial residence - pool, hot tub, tennis court, log fire. Heaven. But why was the mountain biking Vorb crowd coming here? Well, beyond the climbing, they also have two mountain bike trails, and a fantastic BSX course. BSX is like BMX racing, but the course if built on the side of a hill to allow m,ore speed and bigger jumps. We were to be fully sated by the end of the weekend... For the first night, I had the place to myself. Wonderful.  By full flow on Saturday night, there would be about 60 people from Vorb staying, and more coming over just to ride on the Sunday. Vorb exists thanks to one man - Tama - who initially maintained a phone list, then an email list then an embryonic website to keep him and his friends informed about local Wellington rides. It's grown and grown and is now NZ's busiest site, and is still run by Tama. A great acheivement really. It's the online equivalent of Singletrack's UK site. The weekend could be divived into three topics for me. Cycling. Party. Hacky Sack. Yes, for the first time I found myself among some hacky players, so it was great to spend many hours keeping the legs elastic, and even learning some new tricks. Will H - I'll be stalling as well as you by the time I get home!. Party. One thing that really sets the Vorb crowd out from, say, a Singeltrack meeting, is the mix of ages. There were plenty of people around my age (31), lots of 20-somethings, but also loads of ""Groms"" - teenagers. And while the groms do come in for a lot of mockery, it's great to have them here. They provide much entertainment as they prove that they cannot handle their beer. Ask me one day about ""Where's the bitches? Hee hee hee"".  There was also much late night entertainment to be had in the hot tub. Cycling. Where to start? Castlerock has two trails - the Easyride trail, a dull farm track road - and the Freeride. Most definitely NOT dull. In fact, dull is the last word you would ever use to describe it. This trail has plenty of ""XXX"" graded obstacles, which thankfully have easy routes around, but plenty of the non-XXX obstacles are also terrifying.  One memorable section drops about 20m vertically, around 5 switchbacks. The first is entered at speed and throws you back into the slope over a huge root. Immediately you have to feed the wheel around a rock to enter the second switchback, which drops over another 10"" rock. There is no roll out from this drop, the trail turns 90' right straight away into a rut to the next switchback - you have to drop the front wheel, and turn it before the back wheel has cleared the drop. Out of this one, it's another steep rock face down to an easy roll out, but watched the speed, because you've got to cross a 2ft plank of wood over a ditch , turn the last corner, and then off you go to next section. That whole thing has taken about 15 seconds to ride! There were plenty of other sections like this on the trail. The XXX sections included seriously large rock drops, jumps, and vertical ladders. Photos will be uploaded.... My short-travel XC hardtail had a really hard time on the this trail, but it got round ok. Fortunately, the guys from Keewee bikes were there with their demo bikes. Keewee are a NZ brand making freeride and jump bikes. And they were available for all of us to take out and hammer. I can't begin to explain how much easier the freeride trail is on a 6"" travel full-sus bike designed to this kind of riding! Everything was so much easier, and faster. I was riding on the http://andycotgreave.fotopic.net and on Vorb . Aside from the horror of grown men in frocks, there was some damn fine riding on display, and some equally amazing spills. And here's some off-the-bike shots here And all the while, the sun was out, making it a pretty special weekend - meeting so many Kiwi riders was excellent, and thanks to Tama, this Vorb BBQ had turned out to be a huge success."

102,"If you look at a map of NZ, the Coromandel is apparently a small peninsular quite near Auckland on the East Coast. There's no way you would expect it to have so much in such a small place. And given it's small size, you really wouldn't expect so many hills. It's as if the area is the geological landfill area for old and worn volcanoes. The new volcanoes remain in the Central Plateau, but once they've gotten old and rickety, they get pushed up to the Coromandel, piled high and close.  It's a ruggedly beautiful region; the mountains are big and beautiful, but the coastline is also spectacular. The West coast is lined with rocky coves and beaches, and the East has the sand. Cycling up the West and down the East coast allows the rider to appreciate the contrasts between the two sides. It's a massively popular area in the summer, and I really appreciate being here in the relatively quiet spring.  I started this leg in Thames, at the Southwest end of the peninsular, and on day one cycled up to Coromandel town. While there was nothing really of note about the day's riding, it was a good day for the soul - riding along the coast was a new experience, and the views of the mountains further north were inspiring me to keep going. I got a small indication of the climbs to come though.... Coromandel town is a teeny little place, once crowded with gold-miners, but now pretty quiet and with it's fair share of cafe's and bars. And the greatest hostel ever, Lion's Den. Run by the slightly bonkers Lynda, it's a cozy little place, rickety but crammed with flotsam and jetsam, both literally and metaphorically. Driftwood, seaweed and seashells are everywhere, hung on the walls, on every surface. And all manner of craftwork and artwork too.  Linda keeps everyone happy with a wonderful attitude, and rewarded us all with pancackes one day because she was impressed how clean we'd left the kitchen! And she also gave me a handful of fresh veg to keep me going on the day I left. Magic place. If you ever come this way, STAY! I guarantee you'll be there longer than you expected (I was there for four nights instead of one...)"
103,"I was going right to the end of the road at Fletcher Bay, the starting point for Coromandel Walkway  -a well-regarded coastal hike. The road from Thames to Coromandel had been beautiful, but it was the road north of Coromandel that really got the jaw dropped. The water seemed a deeper colour, the mountains more rugged and the bays more beautiful. Part of this was the self-satisfying feeling of cycling where few visitors to New Zealand venture, but largely this part of the peninsular is simply stunning. The ride north was TOUGH. It was a hot day, and the first third was over some big passes. The middle third was flat, allowing me to soak in the sun, the views and the beautiful trees. The last third was the real killer though. Two climbs took me to Fletcher Bay, and cruelly you could see the full extent of each one right from the start. Long and windy, I was also pushing it hard because some ugly storm clouds were heading my way from Auckland.  Most people may be reading this thinking it sounds like hell. But for me, this riding is great - tough and gruelling- if you don't push yourself you won't feel the greater sense of acheivement at the end. And what an end! Fletcher Bay is a sweet little bay of dark sand, flanked by green hills and rocks, with views of Great Barrier Island in the distance. There are no buildings there, and pitching the tent in this remote venue made me very happy.  Sharing this wonderland was one other traveller, Dan, from Montana. A great bloke, super-laid back, it was a pleasure to be sharing this place with someone like-minded.  After a night sleeping (fitfully) to the sounds of the surf, Dan and I set off at 7am to do the Coromandel walkway. A 6 hr return trip along the best coastal scenery I've ever seen! Dense bush and beautiful clear water lit by a rising sun - this kind of thing is hard to beat. It felt other-worldy, and I kept expecting to see a Pteradactyl flying around!  I haven't done much hiking in the last 10yrs, so by the time we got back, my legs were battered. I needed to get a good night's sleep in preparation for the following day's ride back to Coromandel Town (back the way I'd come). Alas, the good weather couldn't hold out. The wind picked up and the rain came down - it was a long night with the tent flapping around, the surf crashing, and the rain battering the tent. I think I got about 3hr's kip! All was not lost however, because the next day dawned bright, with a strong Northerly wind - a tailwind for my ride home! Not that the tailwind made for an easy day's riding. The hills were still huge; but the wind did make a positive difference. Phew! And at the end of an uplifting three days in the remote north it was a weary but happy return to the Lion's Den!"
104,"What better to do than let the brakes go and see how fast Andy, bike and B.O.B can go.  At 60kph I figured I'd better start slowing down. As soon as the brakes go on, however, the bike begins a little speed wobble. The handlebars assume a life of their own, doing a small left-right turn of its own accord. Continued braking forces this wobble to continue, with each little s-shape getting bigger. There I am, now over 60kph with the bike making bigger and bigger s-curves down the road. For about 250m this continued, and boy I was terrified. The edge of the tarmac was getting closer and I knew that if I fell at this speed I would be soon rag-dolling across the road, probably with 35kg of trailer bouncing on top of me. Somehow, I got out of the wobble - not sure if it was my attempt to completely lock my arms, or grip the crossbar with my knees but as soon as it started, the wobble stopped. I got to the bottom of the hill, pulled over, and had to sit down for a minute or two to let the adrenalin work its way out of my system. This was NOT a clever episode to go through - I got away with it this time, and their won't be a next time for this little experience... Conclusion? Don't go faster than 50kph."
105,"That was the main hill for the day, but for the rest of the 40-odd km the were a few more hills. Nothing really of note though, apart from the NDE (see the previous page). Whitianga is a biggish (by Coromandel standards) town set alongside the sandy Buffalo beach. After the week on the west of the Coromandel, it's wonderful to be on sandy beaches with calm bays and views of the scattered islands on the horizon. The day I arrive is the day of the Melbourne Cup, Oz's biggest horse race. Since I'm not going to be back home for the Grand National, the one time I place a bet in the bookies in the UK, I figure it's worth a punt. Randomly choosing the first British horse in the starting list, the old boy comes in third - $120 winnings.  Hurrah! I decided to celebrate with a pint. The beer in the bar is great, but some local Maori younguns give me some hassle - nothing of any real note, but just a general unpleasant attitude. First time that's happened in NZ.  Since the beer celebration didn't quite work, I thought I would then splash out with some fish and chips for dinner. Except that only cost $4.50 (about two quid). And while in the chippy, there was a car crash outside, and the guy who caused it sped off down a side road, immediately followed by the other car. And so they chased each other round the block a couple of times as we called the cops (yours truly did the right thing and got their number plates!) One of the other people in the shop then saw the first car pull into the local drug house, and I figured that then was the best time to leave the chippy and get home to the refuge of the hostel.  Whitiange, eh? Quiet little beach town!?"
106,"Hahei beach is one of the most famous destinations in New Zealand because of the spectacular Cathedral Cove.  Today's ride to the Hahei hostel begins with a 5min passenger (and bike) ferry trip across the Whitianga harbour. And with a bit of Andy luck in operation, I met a woman called Debbie who lived with her kids and partner in Hahei. Within about two minutes of meeting her, she'd invited me to her house for the night. This is great - I can't really imagine that happening too much in the UK, but here the Kiwis are generally tremendously generous to people they meet. Saying Au Revoir to Debbie, I trundled onto Hahei on the bike while she drove off to work with her daughter. Cathedral Cove at Hahei is simply beautiful. It's a bit of a trek down there, about 40min each way, which helps to keep it quiet. The beach is bisected by a huge rocky cliff, with an enormous hole in the centre, the Cathedral itself. I'd expected to be disappointed with such a famous place - this is one of the ""must sees"" for the country, but no way did it disappoint. It's another gold star for the Coromandel. After hanging out on the beach for the afternoon, I returned to Debbie's house for a night of controlled mayhem with her three kids - Sam, Roxanna and Heidi. I had a great night, and really realised how much fun being with kids can be, even though they're a non-stop handful. Possible career change maybe? Teacher..."
107,"I am sure many people will tell me I should have gone, but I'll do some hot pools elsewhere I guess. Another whopping day's riding. A whole 30km. Which got me to Tairua at mid-day. And I was feeling awful. Not enough sleep, too much cycling, not enough rest, probably not enough veggies - I was run-down, slightly sniffy, and kind of pissed off with the bike and just about everything really. I'd been feeling it for a day or so, but as I pulled into Tairua, I knew I needed to stop.  By luck, I'd chosen a great place to stop. Tairua is a tiny little town on a large tidal estuary. At the gateway to the ocean lies Paku, a dominatin old volcanic plug, somewhat like Arthur's Seat in Edinburgh. Either side of the Paku are two golend beaches, and behind the town lie the ranges of the Coromandel mountains.  The hostel, Beach Villa, had a marvellous view of Paku, and had built a deck to allow you to just sit and look out over the bay. Ahhhh! This is definitely a good place to rest. Lunch at the local cafe turned into a marvellous feast, I got chatting to the owners, and after I'd finished the lunch I had paid for, they kept on giving me free food. Spinach and Filo Pastry, home-made muffins, Veggie burgers. Oh joy of joy - feed a cold, they say, and I was fed to the max. Not only were the owners happy and generous, their food is all home-made, and wonderful. So - anyone going to Tairua, you MUST stop at Out of the Blue. It's scrummy. The rest of the day and-a-half in Tairua were spent watching movies, eating oranges, sitting in the cafe, and going to the top of Paku. I love Tairua - nothing really to do, but just look at some marvellous scenery.
"
108,"I've just bussed it from Tairua to Tauranga, where I'm going to spend the weekend with Nick and Missy, who I met in Rotorua. I got a shuttle bus with Go Kiwi! tours. All very good, but jeez I got a hard time for being a Pom. Not so much me, but he kept going on about how The Poms came over and took all New Zealand's Kauri trees and the gold. So somehow it's all our fault. Well, to an extent I agree, but er, hindsight is a wonderful thing - that was the way of the world back then. Yes, we still do it today, but don't blame me for the actions of people from a different time. Grumpy? Moi?  I still have a bit of a heady cold, so a weekend of relaxation and rugby world cup quarter finals should sort me out! Next? The East Cape and then to Napier. I can't wait..."
109,"They've got some decks set up and plenty of old skool dance music on vinyl so i spent a large proportion of the weekend attempting to mix. I never realised how hard it is. Either it's hard, or I just have no rhythmn. Anyone who has seen me dancing probably knows which one of those it is. Also, decided to get Nic to get the clippers out and buzz my hair. Much better to have a number 2 haircut. there's a before and after shot at my fotopic site. Since then I have been told I look like www.coldplay.com"">Coldplay, Judge Jules, and, er, Spud from Trainspotting. I know which of those three I prefer. The problem is that in the past I have seen in myself the similarity between me and Spud. Bugger. Either way, it was a great weekend, and I did feel pretty keen to get back on the bike at the end of it."
110,"Unfortunately, there's the small matter of 150km between me and the ""start"" of the East Cape. Fortunately, the road is straight and flat, and there is a strong tail wind. Which gives me the fastest day yet - I average 26kph for the ride, and get to Whakatane for the evening stop in quick time. Not the best ride really - too many trucks, not enough variety, but the speed kept me happy. I stayed at the karibu backpackers, a nice place, but run by Bruce, who seems to dislike backpackers. As he is showing me round the hostel, he tells me he hates f**kers who lounge around all day, and can't stand it when c**ts leave dishes. Hmm, nice guy. Throughout my (shortened) stay there he continues in this vain, and it's a pleasure to get out of there the next morning. Apparently there's a new hostel in Whakatane run by an oldish Maori couple, so anyone going this way I would recommend NOT to go to the Karibu. Not a lot happening in Whakatane. well, actually, there probably was, but I wasn't in the mood for a town - I wanted to be at the East Cape.
"
111,"Opotiki hostel - wow, a strange place. I walk in to the kitchen to see a middle aged guy randomly tapping on a the table. ""Excue me for a minute, I'm just typing a letter"". Riiiiight. Everyone in the hsotel apart from me was working in town, so were living there rather than travelling.  The wierd guy was Kerry from Oz who had lived in the hostel for FOUR years. He actually turned out to be pretty interesting, he'd clearly been through some rough stuff, but it was great to talk to him about Maori culture which he knew a great deal about. Since I was reading Once Were Warriors at the time, we talked a lot about the spectrum with the Maori tourist cultural visions at one end, and the poor, abusive, and rough living at the other end. Inbetween is where most Maoris live, and heading round the East Cape was to be a good way to find out more about the culture."
112,"It's tough riding, but I just can't explain how better it feels to be doing this on a bike than any other way. Every view is earned, and each bay is a little reward. After several hours of riding, things were getting tough, especially since the weather had been distinctly uninspiring - not wet, but not warm. I fuelled up in the last town before my destination, with 16km to go. As I pulled out, a roadie came up behind me, and we rode those 16k together, chatting along. So, there's me, mtb with slick tyres, pulling along a trailer, and he's on a featherweight frame, and we're chugging along. I'm enjoying the conversation, but not really realising how fast we're going. I'm kind of aware that it's faster than I would be riding if alone, but it's not until we part ways when I reach the hostel that I virtually collapse after the strain! Still, you know me - the exertion was a load of fun. And the hostel was paradise. Here I'd be for a couple of days. It was the only building in Whanarua bay, nestled in amongst the rocks . There were several levels to the hostel, with decking and seats all over the place.  It was surrounded by the most gorgeous pohutukawa trees, which are all over the East Cape and Coromandel. These trees are something else - a big as English Oaks, but blown into all sorts of gnarly shapes by hundreds of years of wind. Their bark is amazingly thick, and to strengthen its main boughs, the tree grows hundreds of smaller shoots which wrap around itself, presumably to create an extremely strong base. Their foliage is a deep green, and when they flower, it's in a deep holly berry red. they keep me smiling and happy whenever I pass them. A much needed day of rest at this hostel refuelled the legs."
113,"But the slow pace is totally appropriate in such a beautiful area. The road is also perfect for cycle touring - this is one of the most remote parts of the north island, so the traffic is virtually nil. I went for long long periods where I didn't see a car or anyone. In the end, I started shouting out loud, singing like a loony, stopping, and just soaking it up.  Most of today was actually inland, cutting around the northern edge of the East Cape, but the hills here are also large and dramatic and more than enough to keep me happy. The last hill of the day was a killer, but my destination was the Motor Camp at Te Aroroa, where the only eight people camping there were all cycists - me with the trailer, a family of four germans on two tandems (the kids are 4 and 5 yrs old!), another german couple and a Dansih guy who was riding the whole 350km of the East Cape in two days. And boy could he talk. Where 10 words would do, he'd rattle off about 100. man, he was dull, and dominated conversation so much noone else could get a word in. AND I offered to share dinner with him, cooked it all, and he didn't lift a finger to clear up. Grrr. Now on the East Coast of the East Cape, it's the mearest bit of mainland to the International Date Line, so everything is the ""first _____ in the World to The Sun"" or the ""Most Easterly _____ in the World."" Initially this may seem exciting but, really, it's not - I mean, the date line is an aribtrary thing anyway, so getting up at 5.30am to see sunrise is kind of daft - it's no more special here than anywhere else. I still did it one day on the East Cape though. I guess that thinking the other 8 billion people in the world aree still to see the nth of November is a little bit interesting. Seeing anm advert for an Irish Pub in Gisborne which described itself as the ""most easterly Irish Pub in the World"" was the last straw.  For a time, I was the ""Most Eastern English Guy With A Bob Trailer in the World"". Wow. There was a power cut in the evening, it was mild and clear, and I had a new sleeping bag that actually kept me warm. Therefore, i figured I'd sleep outdoors - a little nervous, just because I've been a townie for too long, I settled myself in the bag, and turned off the head torch. Bliss, look at all those stars. One minute later there was an almighty angry hissing noise in the tree above. I flash on my torch to lighten the eyes of a possum howling at me. I was back in the tent about 15 seconds later.... Andy c - man of the wild. Not. Possums aren't going to attack, but it seemed easier just to be in the tent.
"
114,"Ho hum. And so it turned out to be one long long long slog. My legs struggling like never before, and I couldn't stop myself watching the odometer. Every km was taking longer than it should. I had to stop and kip a couple of times, but after an eternity, a summited the final climb, and flew the 9km down to Tokomaru Bay, where the East Cape living really showed itself. I stayed at Brian's Place, a small hostel with an amazing reputation. Brian's 50yrs old, so laid back he's horizontal, and runs a cosy hostel slightly up the hill looking over the wide and cliff-lined bay. There's no better place to relax.  the first evening was NZ-Oz semi-final day, and a friend of Brian's, Wayne, invited everyone in the hostel (6 of us) to his house to watch the rugby with his sons and their friends. What a fantastic evening. they were all so welcoming, and shared their day's catch of Crayfish, Moki and kinner (sea urchins - a very strange thing to eat!). Of course, the result went the wrong way, but we had a greeat time. After waking up the next morning with a hangover, I did a whole day of nothing. Nopthing at the beach. Nothing in the hammock. doing nothing is so easy when you cycle - there's no guilt at just loafing around in a hammock with a good book. The only real activity I did today was go look at Wayne's boat that he's building - a 60ft schooner that's taken him 12 yrs so far, it's nearly ready, but is currently sat in a sheltered field, looking pretty incongruous. But, it's his passion, nearly ready, and when it is, off he goes around the world. A man with a good philosophy of life - just do it. Don't fret about money, don't fret about anything, don't even plan too much, if you want to do something, go for it, and it will work itself out. I'm not massively sure how much I can do that myself, but I do try to take some of it with me.  Rounded the day off with more rugby. go England! Very excited about watching the final this weekend!
"
115,"About 15km later, I pull up alongside 5 other cyclists in a tiny patch of shade. And instantly make great friends. Danny (irish) and Anche (german) are riding together, and Marielle (canadian) stuart (english) and Bec (english) are riding together. The threesome are heading just up the road to a DOC campsite at Anaura Bay just up the road. I'd kind of intended to go there, but had forgotten about it. Instant decision made - I'll ride with them; there's a possible food issue, because I didn't plane on stopping before a store, but there you go. And the bay is heaven. Isolated, and with big surf, we pitch tents and go body surf for an hour. Oh man, it was just so much fun in the sun. Good people, great weather and great sea.  An hour after we got out of the water, the weather begins to change. Wind and rain become the order of the day. Bec and Stuart are a couple and have a nice solid dome tent. My lightweight single pole tent is no use and keeps collapsing in the wind (it was real wind). Marielle's tent is nine years old, has no pegs, has wholes in the outer, and zips that don't work. Still, my tent was in such a bad state, I had to abandon, and spent a sleepless night in marielle's seive getting battered by the wind. Still, that's what camping's about sometimes, and it's still fun. We'd pooled our food resources and the best we could do for dinner was baked beans and rice with some butter and Vegemite mixed in. Yum.
"
116,"But not as much as a shocker as the weather. Intermittent showers, but the only thing that was not at all intermittent was the brutal headwind. All day. With intermittent gusts that tried to take you off your bike completely. I'd decided to stick with Marielle, and we would meet up with Stuart and Bec in Gisbourne. It took us 9 hours to do the ride. The wind was killing us completely, but still, it remained fun - 100% good weather would be boring, and even thought it was hard, I'd still have done it no other way. We met up with Danny and Anche for a while and had a comic lunch stop/collapse in the middle of nowhere right by the side of the road, at the top of a horrific climb that wiped us all out. The last 5km were spent with thoughts focussed completely on food. And the fish and chip shop next to the campsite was most welcome, and between us we kept their business going pretty well. And, boy they were good fish and chips too."
117,"Initially, Gisbourne seemed a grim place, but I think any cycle tourist would have a hard time thinking positive thoughts about a city this size after riding the East Cape. A day wandering around though reveals another friendly, attractiove little town, with plenty of cafes and places to keep you happy. For a bit of culture, off I went with Marielle to the local museum which was great. The highlight was the historical photos, and the sections on the history of the town. on the way out, I randomly asked at the desk if they knew anywhere that I could learn to weave with flax. and it turns out I am standing next to a woman who teaches free course every friday back in Tolaga bay. Hurray. So, Friday morning, off we go back to the east Cape to get some basketmaking done. I really can't wait! Most of the rest of the day was spent loafing around and playing hacky sack. Nice to find some people who can do it! And Stuart and Bec got engaged! Amazing."
118,"Maybe it's the hacky sack opportunities. Maybe it's the people. Either way, I've not been on the bike for ages, but i've been having a fantastic time.... read on for the full story of the weekend."
119,"The weekend began early on Friday with a ride up to Uawa with Cynthia, the woman we met at the museum. She works at the museum as a school educator, and spent the day showing myself and Marielle around the township of Uawa. I won't go into the details of everything we learnt, partly because there was so much to learn, it was a little overwhelming. Also, I unfortunately am still struggling to absorb all the Maori terms . But, we both learnt masses about the area, their sacred river, their Maunga (sacred mountain), Titianga, and were also shown around all the local Maraes.  We even got to visit Uawa's new radio station, on the day of its official launch - a big, by Uawa standards, street party with most of the community outside the converted old post office. To see this kind of operation in such a small town - about 700 people - is warming, and just one of countless indications of how this town is tightly knit, and rediscovering its own roots and culture following generations of repression of the Maori heritage. For example, did you know their was an act passed in 1911 that banned Maori women from breast-feeding?  We were being introduced to countless numbers of people, and everyone in the area is related to each other. The Whakapapa (geneology) is extremely important to the Maori, and everyone is very aware of their relatives. Everyone we met welcoming, their warmth and generosity really puts us to shame. When Marielle, Stuart, Bec and I had cycled through this town a few  days previously, we had barely stopped, and I confess I left with a feeling that this was a quiet uninteresting little place. As time went on the town opened up to us more and more. At the end of the day, we headed back to Gisbourne, but ready to return on Saturday morning to begin the weaving classes. I've written about the baskets on the following page. Still piling on the good vibes, we were invited to spend the night on the Te Rawheiro Marae. The marae is a very special place, and we were pretty lucky to be allowed to stay there. And the view fromt the front door was magic. Our evening we spent in the town hall, watching Whale Rider with the locals.  There's really no way to satisfactorily sum up this weekend. Everyone was wonderful, the maori culture is fasicnating, and I can't really explain how special it was to be part of the community for the weekened. I'll be cherishing these memories for a long time. Photos up at http://andycotgreave.fotopic.net"
120,"In Uawa, an initiative has been established by the community to redevelop and strengthen Maori heritage. In the town of Uawa, there are exhibitions of past and present artwork and artefacts, and also 3 months of workshops in all aspects of Maori culture - weaving, weaponry, jewellery, cooking, moko (tattooing), etc. This is all funded by the community and the government and is free for participants. Myself and a friend, Marielle, were fortunate to attend a weekend of raranga. The weaving is all created using flax, an incredibly plentiful plant in this country - as I cycle around, it really is everywhere. The plant can be harvested twice a year, cutting the correct leaves from the plant. I was going to make a small kete, a traditional basket with a plaited base, and for this I had to cut and prepare 40 flax leaves.  The leaf is long and tough, and to get from a leaf to a strand to weave with requires several easy steps and one rather tricky one. The spine and edge of the leaf is removed with the fingernails, that's easy enough. The next step is to remove the top of the leaf from it's spine, a process involving stripping out the fibres by pressing your thumb hard against the leaf and pulling. Done properly, as many of the others there could do, you end up with an attractively frayed end to your flax, with all hoirzontal fibres, the moka, removed. Done by me, I got a few of them right, but lots wrong; nothing a quick comb through wouldn't fix though! Armed now with my prepared flax. it was time to get going. The frayed ends of the leaves were plaited together to create a herring bone pattern, a challenge in itself to keep everything held together - my thumbs were cramping up almost immediately. Once the plaiting is finished, the flax is held together by a whiti (I KNOW I have spelt that incorrectly!) - a tight plait. The next step is to fold over alternate strands of my herring bone pattern of leaves and start creating the shape of the kete. In many ways, this stage is almost the same as making a regular open weave purse, but with the whiti in the centre. Using the flax is amazing during this process, it's such a strong and flexibly material. During all the weaving, there were plenty of opportunities to speak to the rest of the weavers, all Maori women, mostly local, with differing levels of experience. Inevitably, their kete were looking a vast amount better than mine, their experience apparent. But all were encouraging and helpful, and free to offer tips and advice. Plus they all seemed to spend more time gossiping than weaving! All day the area was full of laughter. By mid-afternoon, my basket sides had taken shape, and I spent the rest of the day plaiting a rope to form the handles. A simple process, but one where you could turn off your brain, and get into a really nice rhythm.  By the end of the workshop, I had a rather ramshackle looking kete, especially compared to some of the other's output, but this was mine, and I am extremely glad to have spent the time learning the skills, in the 'proper' setting!"
121,"Everyone, bar ONE person, I have met on this trip has been friendly and kind. Who was the sole person who had a broom up their ass? The main teacher of the workshop, Connie. Marielle and I arrived not really knowing what to expect. When we were introduced to Connie, her reaction was one of utter contempt, an attempt by her to convey, I dunno, either exasperation at these novices, or a complete lack of enthusiasm for teaching Pakeha. I dunno, but throughout the day, she would not so much as smile at us. I told her I would like to make a kete, and that I had made several square baskets before. ""no you haven't"" was her reply, said with venom. At every step of the process, she would belittle our efforts ""hmm, looks like you've done that step, well, it looks okay, I suppose"", and with reluctance bordering on physical pain she would show us the next step of the process.  Thankfully, everyone else in the workshop was completely open and friendly, and there were plenty of others to show us the process, and give us the positive encouragement we needed.  Speaking to some of the younger people in the community later it seems she's like that with many peopole but it did make for some uncomfortable moments. Is it because we were white, and she somehow didn't want us to learn the Maori ways? Who knows, but she was quite an experience. Don't worry, though, despite this one bad egg, the weekend was still wonderful, and she couldn't come close to leaving me with bad memories of the weekend."
122,"Right. I had thought about just getting the bus straight from Gis to Welly, but no, the extra cost (particularly of putting the bike on the bus - $20 every journey) would be worth it. On the bus, it starts raining. And doesn't stop for 48 hours. So, off the bus I get in Napier, only to hurry to a hostel, then hurry to a cafe where i can spend the rest of the day reading. Back to the hostel for the evening, and hoping to wake up to sunshine. No, I wake up and the rain is even heavier, so I spend the rest of the morning in the hostel, and only head out for lunch. Back on the bus, it's still pissing down, another twenty dollars for the bike and off I go to Welly. * Conclusion - Napier didn't do it for me! I did meet a friend of Sheila F's in Napier for lunch though, Sarah, who spent two years on the same 4H Summer Camps in New Hampshire as I did, so it was fun to meet someone with common memories from New England. * This twenty dollar charge is great for the bus company. I only get to take my bike on the bus if there's space. So, the money doesn't go to any kind of reservation for the bike. And then, once I've paid the 20, *I* then get the privilege of putting the bike on the bus myself. So, the money's not going towards any extra work for the driver. At the other end, I get to unload the bike too. Er, so, Mr Bus Company, why am I paying this money? It doesn't reserve me anything, and it doesn't get me any special treatment either. Harumph.
"
123,"In the evening, I was set to meet up with my riding buddies from the Lake Taupo race I did in October. We'd arranged to meet in a pub, and even though I'd only had one beer when they arrived I already felt really wobbly! Must be the lack of drinking I am doing on this trip... We had a fun night though, Claudia Kath and Liam are a great laugh.
"
124,
125,"My riding buddies for the weekend are eight people from Wellington, all connected by New Zealand's biggest mountain biking website, Vorb. Some I have met on other rides in other parts of the country, but some of the others are new faces. Vorb has a busy online forum that appeals to all riders, and that's reflected in the spectrum of bikes between us. At one end, a couple of XC race bikes, at the other is Juan's Big Hit, with 8"" of travel. It promises to be interesting to see how he will get up the one-in-three climbs ahead of us.  There's no roads to the beginning of the trail at Ship's Cove. To get there we get a water taxi. For the Kiwis I am with, this is just another journey, no big deal. But, er, a water taxi? How cool is that? Once they've dropped you, your bike, and your friends off, they even take your bags to whichever hostel in whichever bay you're staying at that night. And at the end of the ride, they pick you up again from the trail end. It may just be me, and my land-lubber ways, but this whole water taxi thing is pretty exciting. The trip out to the trailhead also provides us with some tantalising and daunting glimpses of the trail; dense green bush hugging steep slopes contrasted against a perfect blue sky.  Once dropped off, and satisfied that we have taken enough innuendo-soaked photos of us playing on the cannons at the monument to Captain Cook - he landed here on his global voyages - we can't put off the start any more. A shame because the first 2km of the climb go from sea-level (obviously) to 500m. Today we have beautiful weather, but it has rained for the previous three days, so this ""Can-I-can't-I?"" climb unfortunately becomes a walk. The top is a relief, and provides a taste of the views to come. Behind us is open sea, strewn with steep-sided, forested islands. Ahead are ridge after ridge of mountains, the sounds below radiating a deep greeny-blue. With the hike-a-bike out of the way, we can press on and enjoy the first descent.  The trail varies between narrow and wide singletrack, with many different surfaces. Sometimes you are passing through slippy caramel-coloured clay, keeping the bike balanced to maintain traction. At other times you may be on exposed rocky ledges, riding carefully to keep yourself on the trail. Or you maybe floating the bike over dense networks of roots. Riding the trail is like a Greatest Hits compilation CD of biking. Track one is the rocks of the Brecon Beacons, track two the high Alpine environment of Colorado, track three the parched Andalucian mountains. The vegetation, too, is a marvel. To the native New Zealanders, it may be less exciting, but to a visitor, there's plenty to excite. At lower levels the fauna is dense, reminding me of Tarzan cartoons, but as you rise higher, it dries out, through beech trees, to stubby bush, exposed and sun-hardened. The many gaps in the canopy allow eye-widening views of the Sounds. But don't look too long - there's always a rock placed on the trail to catch you out as you gawp, jaw open, at the view.  Lunch is reached at the end of a 3km downhill section that has me repeating the mantra ""flow"" over and over again. The big-travel boys have disappeared in the distance, but I battle it out with Tama, both of us matched on our hardtails, vying for position. He wins this one, but it's a scream to flick the bike round each corner and try to out ride each other to the next narrowing of the trail. Our lunch stop is a hotel accessible only by boat and trail, allowing us to giggle while supping some refreshingly cold beer.  Once fed and watered, the afternoon spin is ideal for the lightweight hardtail boys and girls in the group. There's plenty of descending and ascending, every drop and climb short and steep. I go at it with legs pumping fast. For the past ten weeks, I have been riding fully laden with touring kit; I am used to riding a bike that handles and accelerates like a slug. And here I am, fuelled by endorphins and a little beer, on a bike that feels lighter than air, with legs loving their release. My rhythm is right on, and the more the climbs make my legs burn, the more my determination to get up them faster increases. This only goes to make the descents even more frenzied. The final drop to Punga Cove is the steepest and most technical of the day, with some hairy rooty drops to give us a final adrenal injection.  Our hostel for the night is a collection of buildings nestled into a tiny cove with a bar at the wharf. There is even a restaurant to feed us, and once we've swam, showered, napped and calmed down, we go to fuel up for the following day. Disappointingly, the restaurant is aimed at boating day-trippers. The food is very nouveau, i.e. expensive and comes in tiny portions. It's not the ideal biker's meal, but it's tasty, and makes a change from the bland rice and tuna that I normally cook for myself while touring."
126,"We're starting at sea level again, which can only mean that the first thing to do today is another climb. Like the start of the previous day, we need to get to the top of the ridge, but at least today we have a hard-packed gravel surface on which to tease the stiff legs into action. The reward for this climb is a stretch of riding along a ridge-top. For 20km we undulate with the ridge. On one side is a view similar to an alpine glacial valley, with meadows on the base and forested mountain slopes. The other side of the ridge looks out to the open sea. The trail leap-frogs from one side of the ridge to the other, giving us views of both.  The end of the ridge drops to Torea saddle, 50m above sea level. Ahead is the most talked about climb of the day. This is the one my riding friends have been talking in hushed terms about all day. Only the greatest riders in New Zealand have ridden it all, they claim. The trails rises painfully from here to 520m in just 3km. It is daunting, but my legs were ready and I had a bag full of determination to make it to the top, ideally in one shot. It was a granny-gear killer. With legs straining right from the start, I have to keep a really tight posture in order to prevent the front wheel lifting, toppling me back down the slope. With heart rate at its maximum, and head exploding in the 30° heat, I eventually could see the top. But as soon as I had seen it, I could no longer keep the front wheel on the ground, and slewed off trail into the bushes. All that effort and I'd been beaten right near the end. Despite this, I was totally pumped up to have gotten this far up the trail.  With every gruelling climb, there comes a descent. The descent was rocky and exposed, requiring deft handling to corner round the multitude of switchbacks. The trail builders surely had mountain bikers in mind as the further down the trail goes, the steeper and more frequent the switchbacks become.  Resting and refuelling at the bottom of this descent, it was apparent that everyone was beginning to tire. ""There's only one more climb,"" our guide, Tama, tells us. Inevitably, the climb was another Escher staircase climb. Riddled with switchbacks, and with no view of a summit, each corner presents the rider with yet another wall to climb. Finally, the top was reached, and now was the grand finale, a 12km blast to the sea. Body tired but brain focused, this was a blur of rocks, trees, exposed rocky sections, and beech-leaf lined wooded sections. There were plenty of short, sharp climbs to muscle the bike over. My legs were burning, but I was racing as fast as I could, trying to process the visuals as best as I could. My body was making many of the decisions itself, weight distributing itself automatically to get the bike over, round, or through any and all obstacles. Jono on his Santa Cruz Bullit was just ahead of me, and I pushed it to the limit to keep up with him on this one.  With one last straight descent, we spat out of the end of the trail. To find a caravan selling tea and ice cream. As our group emerged from the trail, I think we spent enough money to keep those guys going for several months. We simply couldn't eat enough pies and ice cream. We ate greedily, grinning and sharing stories about the ride. We'd all made it in one piece, with no mechanicals, not even a puncture. With the arrival of the water taxi, our long journey home began - water taxi first, then 3hr ferry back to the North Island and then a 3km ride back to a friend's house. It would be a long weary journey but one happily undertaken, my tired mind not thinking about my hurting legs, but instead replaying any of countless great snapshot memories from the weekend.
"
127,"I'm staying in an old mansion in Lower Hutt, 10km north of Wellington. It was built around 1900 and was one of many huge properties on the steep slope overlooking the Hutt river. As development progressed, the main highway was built at the bottom of the slope. This mansion was the only property which didn't have its road access cut off by the highway and is now the only one remaining; the rest were moved out or demolished. It's a lovely house, and has great views of Lower Hutt and Wellington harbour. There are 6 other volunteers, some British, some Americans, and a Canadian. I'm the oldest, unsurprisingly, and the youngest is Caitlin, who is 18. We're all in the house together along with Mandy, our Volunteer coordinator. Everyone's cool. Kind of. Mandy and I are unfortunatley like a pair of male deer continually clashing antlers. She's a good person, but riddled with hypocritical opinions, and with some sort of power trip on controlling the household. For example, she told me off (!) for turning the computer off becuase it's a waste of energy to turn it on and off too much. This was just after she had driven the van ONE HUNDRED METRES to go take a tent down in the lawn of the house....  Ah well. I am sure she will be bitching about me somewhere. Jason, one of the other volunteers reckons I should just let things like this lie, but it's not in me to allow someone to tread on people - I just can't help taking the bait."
128,"The final installment of the Lord of The Rings trilogy had its world premier today in Wellington. A HUGE event. I am sure you'll be reading about it all in the gossip mags soon. We got off the train and ran to the parade - gotta get to the crowds to see the celebs. Yes, I was there, stood nose-to-sweaty-back with thousands of other geeks seeking some sort of life enhancing view of someone else driving past in a slow moving parade. I had a great time, but really, is seeing Liv Tyler wave randomly while some foul-breathed beardy wierdo leans on you from behind that interesting? I have to conclude that it is. Most of the cast were there, as were scores of extras in impressive costumes. It all went past us in maybe 15 minutes, but to be on the streets with maybe 100 000 others did seem pretty special. But all this for a film? We then tragically spent 3 hours sat on a hill watching a biug screen showing the celebs walk to the Embassy Theatre along the 1km red carpet. Funnily they all seemed to agree that: 1. Wellington is the nicest city in the world 2. LOTR is a great film 3. Peter Jackson is a god. No doubting, though, it was a fun day, and I dunno, I guess I earned a couple of Smug Points today by being able to say ""I was at the world premier of the LOTR third bit"""
129,"Our first 'proper' day's was on Tuesday. In hindsight, I think this was the least exciting, but it was still an okay day. We stayed local today, and worked on clearing some of the ruined properties along the slope adjacent to the house. There is a lot of history hidden by the new forest growth, and there is an effort to reclaim some of it. This involves weeding and path clearing. All day. It wasn't too thrilling, but we did acheive some pretty great results - what started in the morning as an apparently uninteresting patch of green was cleared. Inside the area was the remains of a fernery greenhouse, along with paths, walls, old fern labels, rock gardens and even a water feature!
"
130,"For me, the day was more exciting because we were to be working with Jonathan Kennett. Who? Well, if you ask ANY mountain biker in New Zealand about the Kennett brothers, they'll know who you're talking about. The Kennetts have been mountain bike advocates in New Zealand for many years, and have probably done more to develop the sport, trail access and MTB conservation than anyone else in the country. They run the Karapoti race, they have written THE bible for New Zealand mountain bike rides and are reknowned for being strong and talented, and extremely nice guys. Everyone I met in the country talks of them with some awe. And of course, in person, he's a top bloke. As is his partner, Bronwen, who we also spend the next two days working with. The day starts with a tour of the park by John (?) Wilson, a New Zealand botanist - apparently a world famous botanist if that's the kind of thing you knwo about. It's an amazing little trip round the forest, because not only are the trees here amazing to look at, by getting up close and lingering around them, there is a sense of complete awe at how amazing some plants are. I loved all the vines and parasite plants that strangle the trees. But bugger me, I can't remember any of their names now! Arse. Well, the trees were amazing - you'll just have to believe me... For most of the morning, we went down into the valley of the park to 'release' the newly planted trees. Release = weeding. The new plants don't compete well with weeds until they are about a metre high, and so until they reach that height, it's down to volunteers to get in there and clear the weeds. Doesn't sound much fun, but it's a very pretty area, and relazing work.  In the afternoon, we head up to Makara Peak (photos and other info), Wellington's most famous mountain bike park - a huge section on the edge of town handed over to bikers, 'paid' for by much conservation work carried out by local riders. As well as trail building, the local bike community replants native trees and carries out a lot of pest control. Amazing to think that a city could be so forward thinking! I spend the afternoon deberming one of the trails. Great fun."
131,"Not only that, most of the slope we're walking on is loosely gravelled.  All of which provides a good playground. I spend the day making holes for the trees with a pick axe. This involves scrambling up the slope (two steps up and one step back). Swinging the tool, the sliding down the scree to do the next one. Most entertaining."
132,"For example, when I did the trip to Utah, it was planned pretty much exactly the way I wanted it to be, and that was because everyone else was happy to go along with my ideas.  If I'd have gone to Taupo, Mandy and I would have killed each other! Enough ranting, what have I been up to? I spent Friday evening at a friend's house playing games. Not your average monopoly, pictionary, or scrabble. No, this was proper gaming - ie games with hundreds of rules. It was hysterical because everyone was a complete rule follower. We were playing a game set in the Wild West and someone queried a rule. Most people would make a rule up, or allow a compromise here. But no, we duly stopped play, the rule book was consulted and the rule confirmed. Immediately, the guy reading the rule book noticed that another rule we had been playing with was incorrect; therefore we simply must change the way we play to be correct, even though the way we had been playing was perfectly acceptable to everyone. The reason this was funny was because there's no denying it was super geeky, but also because it suited me down to the ground - i'm a total rule follower in games, but normally don't find enough people with the same attitude, and if I try to enforce rules properly, mostp eople just tell me to shut up [Liz, Giles, Johnny - remember the rule about taking your hand off the horse in The Really Nasty Horse Racing Game??] Saturday took me into Welly for some shopping. I hung out in the Cuban quarter, and spent a wonderful half hour sat on a bench watching a kid do some magic busking - he was drumming using two buckets and a crate. And it was awesome. He was very animated and was getting a vast range of sound out of the instruments. A crowd formed and just as he was getting really frantic, along came The Man and gave him a ticket for noise pollution. Cue much jaw dropping from the crowd. I asked the warden bloke what he was doing, and when I asked him if he thought it was really fair to give a busker a noise pollution ticket while being surrounded by workmen drilling in a nearby shop he threatened to have me arrested. I asked him what I could be arrested for, and he said obstructing justice! I backed down, but kind of wished I'd have provoked the situation. All I had done was ask a question, and the comedy of police arriving at a scene like that would have been great. But, Andy is just too safe a guy! Met up with Claudia (riding buddy from the Taupo race) and had a great evening drinking coffee and watching a movie - Satin Rouge.  And on Sunday, I had planned to go enter a race on Makara Peak, but woke up late, with a slightly sore knee, and decided to give it a miss. Instead, I'd go for a gentle spin on the hills behind the house. Gentle spin? OUCH. From the front door, 4km of tarmac climbing, then 3km of granny gear heinousness (I don't care if that's not a proper word, it fits the feeling I had). But what a reward. I rode up to the Belmont Trig in Belmont Park to a 360' view. Lower Hutt beneath me, Wellington in the distance, and on the other side of the mountain, the West coast and Porirua. Amazing.  What goes up comes down. Faster. An hour to get up, and twenty minutes to come down the other side, on some wonderful singletrack - just the right sort for someone riding on their own. Not too easy, but not so challenging that it makes you bail out. Home with a grin on my face.
"
133,"Our job for the day? Weeding. Again. This time, we're in the marae's nursery, sorting out the plants in the nursery that will be used to replant all the land around the marae. Until ten years ago, it was all pasture land; the aim now is to restore it to native forest. The project's been going on for a while, and it's looking great. This restoration of land is a big deal in New Zealand. In many places you can see pasture next to restored forest, and it gives you and idea of what my own country may once have looked like - the UK has been cleared of forest for so long, it's not somethiing that will ever be restored. There's a passion for restoration in New Zealand because the clearing has only happened in recent memory. We overnighted in the Marae, but before that we went for a kayak in Welly harbour. And what do you know? About 30 dolphins came and swam around us. Incredible! They're such graceful creatures. And it was made all the more sweet when we realised that most tourists pay 100 dollars for this privilege..."
134,"In remote remote land, we skirt the surf on our right. On our left, bleak hills rise in a curve from the sea. Scree covered, they are forboding and uninviting. It provides a remarkable view as we hurtle along the gravel road. This is probably as remote as I have felt so far this trip. There's a few settlements along the road, including the tiny town of Ngawi. It has now wharf, instead it launches boats from the beach using bulldozers. Apparently there are more bulldozers per head of population than anywhere else in the world! It's quite a sight. We stop beneath the scary high lighthouse and spend an hour wandering up the beach counting seals. They're all wallowing around on the beach. And they're amazing. They're kind of aggressive if you get too close, but you're definitely close enough to feel pretty awed by them. There's huge males, big females and plenty of cubs too. All backed by black beaches, massive rocks and crashing surf. My jaw was on the ground for most of the day.  I loved it!"
135,"We camp out in the bush in the evening which is lovely and spend the second day hacking out a trail on a landslip. Strangely, this turns out to be one of the most enjoyable pieces of work over the last two weeks. I've found the program fascinating in the places we've been and the people we've met. But the work has been numbing. Hacking out dirt from the side of a hill to create and shape a trail though is lots of fun, it turns out. I don't think everyone else agreed. Ah well. I had fun."

137,"And I'm going to ride it with Simon and JOnathana Kennett, amongst others. As I've said elsewhere, these guys are FAMOUS - there aren't really any other rides whose names are so well known in the country. Simon is the faster of the two, and has raced with all the greats (Ned Overend, Gary Fisher, etc). I wake up excited. But the weather's poo. Down in the Hutt, it's just kind of misty, but quite brighht. But as we drive up to the start of the ride, the mist thickens and the moisture turns to rain. At the car park, it's just like home. Heavy drizzle. Wodnerful. Normally this wouldn't deter anyone, but given that this ride involves four significant river crossings, it's touch and go whether we'll do it. Off we set. The first five km is a blast along an old track in Karapoti Gorge itself. The gorge is deep and spectacular. Apparently. I'm so busy blinking water out of my eyes and trying to avoid rocks, ruts and puddles that I can barely see, that I don't look around much. And what has been sold to me as a ""medium"" pace is turning out to be damend fast. No problem, just something I am not used to.  We reach our first major junction, and the weahter has gotten worse. It is just like home bar one fact. The temperature here isn't too bad. Standing around gets cold, but it's really humid and once you're moving, everything heats up well. Decision time. Riding the 50km will be hard. Who is up for it? I am the only one willing to give it a go. Which is a bit of a disappointment, but not really surprising - the weather really is crappy.  Simon wants to do some hill training, so myself and stuart decide to join him while the rest head back to the cars. And boy, am I getting shown up on this trip! Hills here are steep steep steep. In the UK, steep doesn't even come close. We do the ""warm up"" climb and i nearly puke. One slippy slidey descent later and we reach the climb Simon wants to do his warm up on. Ouch. Simon and Stuart are fantastic riders - they can get up these slopes making them look almost flat. My style is rather less gracious. I get up just about everything, but it's nice to be schooled - there is still much to learn! I also realise that I'm riding with some of the better riders in the country and if I am closeish to them, then that's a good thing. After another hour of rain and rivers and mud and worn out brake blocks we fly back to the cars. Not quite the day I wanted, but good enough for a taster of what the full course is like. The race is going to HURT."
138,"I am now on the South Island, in Christchurch, having got the ferry/train from Wellington yesterday. The train journey was incredible. I had been warned about it but not really prepared - even though it's close, the south island is very different. REAL mountains, even with snow! Parched farmland. And very few settlements. I am here for the next few months, and already am thrilled with what's to come. And so, it's nearly Christmas. I'm spending it with a friend, Sammy, his girlfriend Kat, and their parents. I can't wait for another variation on the Christmas theme.  The trip so far has been amazing, as you all probably guessed. I figured it would be worth summarising it so far.... And so, in the interests of condensing something into nothing, here's the trip so far for those who've not looked at the journal: Fly to San Francisco. Ride in Marin and see some guys in leather Arrive Auckland, uck. Spend cash and get out of there Northland - rain. Get lift to Taupo. Race my bike for 12hrs.  Relax for a day. Jump out of a plane. Do more mountain biking. Ride to Rotorua. Pooh, it smells.  Go to Castlerock. Ride crazy trails, drink beer, have fun in a hot tub Ride around the Coromandel. Amazing. Hills. Bays. Remote stuff. Nearly kill myself at 67kph. Wend my way to the East Cape. Despite being fitter, ride slower because it's so wonderful. Ride with some new friends for a few days. Get to Gisbourne. Go back to East Cape to make baskets. Amazing Go to Napier to see Art Deco buildings. It pisses down for 2 days. See none. Wellington. Ride the Queen Charlotte Walkway. Ouch it's hard. But the best ride of the trip so far.  See some celebs promote some overrated, overlong film. Two weeks of weeding. oops, conservation.  Train to Christchurch. So there we have it. My trip in 100 words. Kind of makes me wonder why I bother with the journal. :-) I hope you all have a wonderful christmas, i will be thinking about you. See you all in the new year! Love Andy"
139,"And, boy, do I eat some good food over these three days! Dux de Lux - vegetarian heaven, with a microbrewery on site. Thai Smiles - the most amazing fish curry I've ever had; beautifully tender pieces of fish, and clear-your-head chilli strength. And Santorini - wonderful Greek food, with friendly hosts, live music, and acrobatic barmen to keep us happy. Once my touring starts again, it'll be back to the pasta and tuna meals, but for now, I'm loving this eating experience! Seeing the city is fun. We go to all the arty museums. Unfortunately, I can't really say I was moved by much of what we saw. At the main art museum, all the exhibitions were a little flat. They were themed exhibitions pulled from the permanent collection, and didn't really inspire me. The history museum contained many wonderful pieces of Maori heritage, but, it's awful to admit, once you've seen 20 kete, palisades, tiki, waka and the like, you don't really need to see any more, however nice they are. I did really enjoy the exhibition in the Art Centre about Antrarctica - its geology and the history of its exploration. I did learn plenty here, and felt humbled by the hardships early explorers endured. With our modern fabrics, our time in harsh environments is a breeze.
"
140,"Come December, I'm in Christchurch, and a quick search on the 'net tells me that the Canterbury Mountain Bike Club are running a club ride to the Craigieburn Forest, up near Arthur's Pass. The New Zealand MTB Bible, '400 Classic Mountain Bike Rides' by the Kennett brothers lists this as one of their favourite rides, so I make a few telephone calls and plan to meet the group early on a Sunday morning. One of the great pleasures of New Zealand is how friendly and inviting everyone is; people are always happy to have you along, and Kiwis have a great pride in showing off their country's assets to visitors. Bikes loaded onto cars, our large group heads from Christchurch to the forest, 100km away. Being a pom, I'm used to poxy little hills, and the drive towards Porter's Pass (945m) is amazing. These are 'proper' mountains, and I'm about to ride up and down the side of one of them. Excitement level increases a notch or two as the vistas reveal themselves through the clouds. The trailhead is reached, and the ritual of sun screen and insect repellent application begins. This makes a change from the rituals of wrapping-up-warm and waiting for a break in the rain I am used to back home at this time of year! Above us rise majestic peaks, dense bush rising until it meets barren scree slopes and near the top, some remaining snow patches from the Winter. It requires a strained neck to look up to the top. Which is about where we'll be pretty soon! The climb is actually not as tough as I expected. We follow a well-packed gravel road out of the valley. The gravel isn't too loose, so traction isn't a problem, and it's not steep enough to give us any issues with keeping the front wheel down on the ground. It's not totally simple though. What it lacks in technical challenge, it makes up in aerobic gruntiness. On and on it goes. There are a couple of switchbacks in the climb that I find slightly demoralising - lungs working hard, I attach a mental bungee rope to the corner, haul my bike around it, only to look up and see another long stretch of gravel ahead. The benefit of this climbing is of course the expanding view across the valley. An hour later, we're sat at the top of the climb, snacking on our lunch, and anticipating the fun ahead. Sitting perched on the edge of the trail, I can see the trail crossing scree slopes and heading into the beech forest beyond. My riding companions have been talking up the difficulty of riding across scree and as I look at it now, my stomach flutters. After one final dreamy look at the landscape, and a group photo, we snake off downwards.  Riding across scree slopes is new to me and requires fast learning. I've found myself near the front of the group, so feel some pressure to keep moving, and at a fair pace. The first scree section is mostly shoe-sized rocks. What passes for a trail across this section is more of an indication of one. The rocks have been slightly flattened, but the camber is such that it is barely wide enough for your bike, and the upslope stones continuously threaten to clip your pedals. Riding through requires a steady cadence and fine balance. There's no space for your feet if you dab and it's easy to spin out your back wheel.  Nervously through one section, we reach some beech forest only to emerge 100m later onto more scree. My big-rock skills are no use here, this section is gravel. Scree lesson number two then. This is much more challenging. The trail heads steeply downslope, before turning upslope just before the next beech forest section 75m away. Heading down is straightforward, just lean into the slope and let the bike go. But the upslope turn provides much comedy. Turning is not possible, any attempt to rotate the handlebars only causes the front wheel to dig into the gravel, unceremoniously dropping the rider into the upslope or over their bars. We all have a go, but noone gets past the corner. No problem, it provides much entertainment. For the next two kilometres, we repeat the beech/scree combination. Some sections I walk, some I ride and some I stumble through. The beech sections here are also pretty tough. The narrow trail is cut into a steep slope. On the right is a 'don't look down' drop through the forest, and on the left the slope is steep enough to occasionally grab the handlebars. I am riding quite tensely, never one to be too comfortable on these exposed trails. I am wondering if this is the style of trail for the rest of the descent, and hoping that it's not. At the end of a short-sharp technical climb, we have a break and our ride leader tells us there's no more scree. Phew! There is also a noticeable air of excitement amongst the group, because we are at the top of the Luge; the primo singletrack that makes all the climbing and scree-crossing worthwhile. Those who have ridden this trail before promise great things. For the next twenty minutes, the grin on my face grows and grows. Beech singletrack is a joy I have not experienced in the UK. The trees are densely spaced, but allow a lot of sunlight through. Riding at speed makes me feel like Luke Skywalker evading stormtroopers in Return of the Jedi. Trees whiz past as I dodge the bike left, right, up, down. The trail surface is carpeted with leaf-litter. Beech leaves are the size of a small coin, conceal the ground, and offer great traction. Descending, adrenalin flows as you float the bike over the multitude of roots. Occasionally a mistimed weight change will pitch you into a rut, slowing you down. I even bring myself to an immediate stop once by mistiming a corner and slamming my right arm into a tree alongside the trail. Grinning, a few hard pedal strokes is enough to get you back up to speed.  We shoot out onto the gravel road at the bottom of the trail like rounds from a Gatling Gun. Everyone is pumped and attempts to somehow put into words the pleasure of the trail; unnecessary really, just looking at each other's wide eyes is enough to share the excitement.  A cruisey gravel road takes us back to the cars, and from there we head out of the forest to a café to enjoy one more wonderful New Zealand biking ritual - pie and coffee! Basking in the sun sharing stories of the ride with my new friends, I spare a thought for my UK riding buddies whose post-ride ceremony right now probably involves shivering, removing wet clothes, and an hour's hosing the bike to remove the mud!
"
141,"It promises therefore to be an uninteresting day. A day when there is no escape from the dirty tricks your mind can play; nothing to distract you from any worries or niggles. And on SH1, the mind can play dirty tricks. It is the main highway, and the traffic is fast, heavy and plentiful. With many huge trucks, pulling two trailers.  Cycling the road therefore is a nervy affair; vehicles are flying past at up to 110kph. Mostly there's a shoulder to cycle on, but this is sometimes only a foot wide. Every now and then, a vehicle will hurtle past you giving you maybe as little as eighteen inches space. I try not to let it bother me, but sometimes I'll not hear a truck until the air is buffetted away and my bike and trailer are pushed sidewards, giving me quite a shock. Despite these issues, it's mostly a head thing; there's no real risk. The traffic may be fast and sometimes pretty close, but the drivers seem pretty sensible. The lack of external stimuli doesn't stop you thinking about the potential risk though. Today is not made any better by the many warnings about the bridge over the Rakia river. This is one of New Zealand's longest bridges and has no footpath, cycle path or even a shoulder. That's right. Two kilometres of 100kph highway, a single lane in each direction, and my slow bike has to share the lane.  The guide book recommends taking a different route and locals have described the concrete wall that lines the side of the bridges. All day in my head I can't stop thinking about the bridge; the more I think about it, the more fearful my mental picture of the bridge becomes. Every truck that passes me raises the fear factor that little bit more. Multiple scenarioes play out in my mind - trucks overtaking dangerously, distracted campervan drivers, boy racers impressing their mates, they all have my life in their hands. By the time I reach the bridge, the mental picture I have is similar to the highway in Matrix Revolutions - ""It's suicide to drive on the highway,"" said Morpheus. The road in my mind is populated with monstrous trucks and anonymous MPVs, the sides are high, impenetrable, hard concrete.  The bridge appears in front of me with no cermony. Without cermony or warning, here it is. It's pancake flat, straight as a ruler, and there are no signs to forewarn rider or driver.  Gulp. Here we go. My plan is simple - ride two metres from the side of the road, and sprint. The one benefit of the day is the tailwind - I manage to get up to a speed of 45kph easily. I am scared of this road, and I want to be across it as quick as possible. The lanes are narrow, and the concrete wall isn't as big as imagined, but it's certainly not going to offer any means of escape in an emergency. The seal on the bridge is grooved; as cars pass in the other direction the grooves generate a sound just like formula one cars - neeeeeeeeeeowwwwwww - which doesn't help my state of mind.  Two cars pass me safely. Phew. After a minute I can see the end. I steal a glance backwards - no trucks visible. 500 metres to go. And, joy, a car behind me slows right down to my speed. The car could have overtaken me, but it is clear that the driver has decided to give me an escort. Legs burning, I put on one more spurt, and reach 50kph, and emerge out of the far side of the bridge, waving to my escort as he overtakes.  I'm in one piece after what was only two minutes of riding. And no trucks passed me on the bridge. With only 30km to go to Ashburton, I can finally relax. Cycle touring in New Zealand is undoubtedly amazing and infinitely rewarding, but the road network does contain several of these challenges that are not bike friendly. Maybe one day soon they will be made bike friendly. Until then, I have to accept that the Fear Factor will be a presence in my mind, making the expectation of an obstacle worse than the actuality of it.

142,"What easy tour do I choose to entertain myself with for the next week or so? Banks Peninsular - some of the steepest roads in the country. Lots of 0 to 600m climbs, in not a lot of km... ouch. But, before heading off, what's kept me busy recently? Christmas was spent at Kat's family. A huge farm in the Canterbury plains. Basically this was five days of wonderful wonderful food. Kat's mum, Kat and her brother did all the cooking, and somehow managed to do something exciting and tasty every single meal. Great stuff! Xmas in the sun is pretty wierd. It was nice to swim in their pool on Xmas day. Sammy and I played much flutter guts.  And much Scrabble. There now follows a very sad story, best read only by those who appreciate that I'm a bit of a wordy nerd when it comes down to it.... And here's a real word geek story that i know you will appreciate... ;) We were playing our third or forth game and had introduced a rule that you had to play in underr 3 minutes. Mainly to keep Sammy moving forward - he'd happily think for ten minutes if you let him. Also, we had been playing a rule that only two letter words in the dictionary (they had a big dictionary, but not the concise) were allowed. THis was a means to handicap me slightly. BUt, this meant that I had to gamble about words I knew are valid 2 letter words and if they weren't in the dicitionary I would lose the go. (the rulebook for Scrabble now has all the two letter words in there, so we could at least consult that). BUT, this rule actually worked against me - losing a turn completely was costing me lots of points. Eventually, I got to a point where I had the Z, and needed to get rid of it. I could either put down ZO and also make OM, but I reckoned ZO wouldn't be in the dictionary. Or, I could put down ZED, and make EM and DO. . Either way, whatever I put down I was going to lose a turn. So I decided to suggest, midway through the game that maybe we should change the rule and I shouldn't actually lose a turn, but just get another chance to play another word. Well, me and Sammy both being stubborn buggers, we then had an intense debate (NOT an argument) about rules, blah de blah, that went on for ages. And the rest of the family were listening in, aghast at our passion. Eventually, we agreed that I should not actually lose a turn. But this had all taken so long, he said that I really should play damn quick. Arse, what was I going to do? So I looked at my tiles, and within one second, noticed I had IDOLIZE, and there was a D on a triple. So, after all this arguing, I put down IDOLIZED, on a triple, and with a 50 point bonus. ONE HUNDRED AND FOURTEEN POINTS!!! Sammy was not happy. But I was.... Geek? Moi? Well, that was one of the highlights. Sorry if it's brought me down in your estimation at all!!!

143,"Woke up on New Year's Eve with a cracking hangover. Good job I was spending a quiet evening down in Rolleston (12km from ChCh) with Rosie, hubby Jo and bro in law and wife. Rosie was a colleague from RCP. A really nice quiet evening spent with them, but prob the quietest new year i have had in many many years. I was in bad by 1215! New YEar's day was a bit of a write off, but I headed up to other new friends, Rick and Trudy, who I met on the Craigieburn ride, to talk bikes and touring. Great day and evening with them and Cath and Andy. Got me all excited about the South Island."
