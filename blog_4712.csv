0,"At Owhango after 20kms we went across latitude 39degree south, so the sign by the road said. Then later on into view came the volcanic mountains of Mt Tongariro 1967metres and Mt Ngauruhoe 2291metres (these are both extinct) just as the clouds had quickly dispearsed from them to give clear blue skies and it was warming up a lot as well. The Tongariro Crossing is a 6-8hr walk across these two volcano's and is classified as 'one of the  world's greatest one day walks'. All very subjective but it is an excellent walk through a very unique landscape. We did it 2 years ago on a day very much like today. Further up the road the snow capped volcano of Mt Ruapehu at 2797metres (this one is still active, though currently dormant) came into full view - what an impressive sight. It was in our view for most of the rest of the day.      But just as things were looking really good they went downhill from here or rarther uphill and very uphill. The railway line  at Raurima goes on lots of little spirals to gain 200 metres in height to get onto the plateau whilst the road, darn it, just goes straight up. Not that bad you may thing, well, unfortunately it was steep (make that very steep) and the sun was fully out now and we were sheltered from the breeze so it was hard, sweaty work, make that very hard, sweaty work. The legs decided at the top that that was it, we're going on strike, enough's enough - give us a break mate. Luckily National Park village was a few levelish kms further on where we could get food, drink and some rest.  Mt Ruapehu dominates the skyline around here; the view from the pub window gets 10 out of 10. We were both a bit in collapse mode and thought that if the next 35kms to Ohakune was very hilly then it might take us ages with the state of our legs but fortune shined down on us and we got some good downhill runs and only a few short hills and then later a tailwind so we covered the 35kms in 1hr 20mins. The moral of which is: no matter how much somebody complains about something they can always overcome that obstacle with the correct determination - did you hear that, legs!      Anyway just to show that we have some compassion we are going to give them a day's rest tomorrow - well they have been on the go for 6 consecutive days now and have taken us up lots of hills. They deserve a rest - but only a day mind. Weds 07/01 - leg's rest day Cool, cloudy and breezy was the good morning greeting so there was no need to rush out of bed and we had no intention of doing that either - it was rest day! Ohakune is a pleasant place being a walking centre in the summer and a ski centre for the winter so it had lots of facilities yet was a quiet relaxing place and the campsite was only a 2min walk from the centre - we could manage that, so we did it twice, in between doing nothing very much. It brightened up by lunchtime to become a very pleasant day indeed - exactly what we needed.   "
1,"    Ohakune is about 800metres high, don't know what the height of Ohingaiti is but we had a lot of descending today especially from Waioura after 27kms on State Highway 1. We had decided to bite the bullet and follow SH1 rarther than seek out minor routes mainly because of the indifferent weather this morning and we are also keen to get down to Wellington and then onto the South Island a.s.a.p.    The lady in the Info Centre at Ohakune said SH1 had a hard shoulder (which it did) and the added benefit was the traffic actually wasn't too bad; it just built up during the day but was no worse than a lot of the roads we ride on in the UK.  So with a favourable wind and lots of descending (though still with a few uphills thrown in) we managed to average 22.5kph so no wonder we used the big chain ring a lot and shouted yippee! -  and about time too! We had a pie and coffee stop at Waiouru after 27kms then another cafe stop at Taihape after nearly 60kms and then at Mangaweka further on there was a cafe in a airplane so we just had to stop there for the novelty value.       The only issue today was that there was no campsite for another 60-70kms in the direction we were going after Mangaweka so we found a good value hotel/pub at the small township of Ohingaiti and by mid-afternoon we had showered and had a beer. No cooking tonight as it's pub food and another beer or three and a big cooked breakfast tomorrow to set us going.    We got a text message from Richard & Elaine who were now south of Auckland after leaving Wellington this morning; they had taken a different route north so we missed each other. They are spending their last few days above Auckland before flying on to LA on the 12th. Today's interesting fact: At Tangiwai before Waiouru there are warning signs and lights and also gates that can be remotely brought across the road to stop traffic going across a bridge. The river here is prone to flash flooding and was the scene of NZ's worst rail disaster many years ago.   "
2,"Well, we had an interesting, varied and a good day today. We knew it would be like that from the moment the pub cook knocked on our bedroom window so she could climb in through it as she didn't have a key and the owner was still in bed and she couldn't raise him. On top of last night's huge meal (and beers) we had 2 large sausages, 2 eggs, a pile of bacon, hash browns, tomato and a heap of toast to get through before we were off. We took a sausage each away with us intending to eat it on the road but we hardly ate at all today such was the amount of calories we were holding in store.    Weatherwise we had a whole bag of stuff with the common theme being the gusty wind which got stronger as the day went on. It was blowing from the NW which apart from a few sections where we had a difficult side wind to cope with it was mainly a tailwind blasting us along and being that extra gear going up the hills of which there were quite a few today. It was appropriate that one long climb should lead up to 'Stormy Point Lookout' - it was that sort of a day. There were lots of broken branches and tree debris on the roads and quite honestly any other direction than the one we were going would have been impractical on a bike. We started off bright and sunny and finished bright and sunny but in between a rain front came through for about 4hrs; total cloud cover and squally showers of which we got none apart from a bit of drizzle - good planning, eh? The best one was when we got to Cheltenham and had just sat down outside the dairy under the canopy when the cloud above us just decided to dump the lot. Water everywhere and then nothing 10mins later.    The wind also helped to break this trip's speed record which was held by Jo at 65kph. Well I got to 69kph and was going for the big 70 but ran out of downhill. Unfortunately this record probably won't get ratified by the committee(Jo) as the wind speed was definitely outside the permitted level. Routewise we went down SH1 for about 12kms before taking SH54 (the backwind hilly road) to Cheltenham and on towards Feilding. Struggling with a side wind from Cheltenham on a long straight road we turned it into a backwind by turning left for 18kms to Ashhurst. Our map showed a camping ground here (we needed an early stop to get some clothes washed). However it was a very basic bare facilities place and a bit naff so we carried on for another 18kms to Woodville. This section involved a lovely winding 6kms climb on the old road (the busy main road goes through a gorge) to take us over a saddle into the next major valley. When we were at the top we watched a rainstorm pass right over Woodville in the valley below - it was dry when we got down there.        Woodville had a good basic camping ground near the centre of town but no clothes washing facilities. Anyway, even if we had washed anything they would probably have got blown off the washing line as the wind was really strong now. The site only cost us 4$; it had a good shower(one) and one toilet and a sink but nothing else so we are eating out again tonight but not as much as last night that's for sure. Postsript: went to the local cafe and had the 'Roast of the day' which was 'hogget' which according to the lady behind the counter is a 'teenage sheep' - i.e between lamb and mutton! We must have lead sheltered lives as we didn't know that - it was good though. In Woodville we went to a shop and whilst in there read about a girl camper who had been blown away and killed whilst in her tent on a hill in the Marlborough Sounds (that's the very north of the South Island) - that was during last night. We are getting those same winds now but we are quite sheltered here though the tent at the moment (18:00hrs) is getting a real bashing. Things of note today: Funny how yesterday's and today's distance are the same; actually to within .25 of a km. Whilst coping with a difficult side wind early on a magpie had the audacity to dive bomb me; gave me a real bash on the helmet. I have now got a beak puncture hole as a momento and if I ever see that magpie again....... Warning to others on the road tomorrow: Keep upwind of us as we may smell a bit, well one of us will (guess which one). I have run out of clean cycling clothes. Got a text from Richard & Elaine; they are way up north above the Bay of Islands and enjoying high temperatures and no wind.
"
3,"Overnight we had to endure a variety of barking dogs from neighbouring houses who were, shall we say, a bit of a nuisance; we won't be stopping at Woodville campsite again. They were still going strong when we packed up and called off for a light breakfast in town after dropping off the key to the campsite shower/toilet; that involved shoving it under the door of the pub on the corner. We then took the highway for 16kms to Pahiatua for an early coffee stop as we didn't know where the next cafe would be. That's one of our rules: don't presume that there will be a cafe available at precisely 11:00hrs, grab your morning coffee when you can. The weather today: cool and quite cloudy to start with and then by lunchtime we had total blue skies and by mid afternoon when we finished it was hot to very hot - high 20's C.The Nor'wester from yesterday was still blowing but nowhere near as strong and it blew us along most of the way along gentle roads. We would have recorded our fastest average speed today except we hit about 10kms+ of gravel road, a section of which was really bad and slowed us down considerably, but the scenery was good as we struggled along. We are in the Wairarapa district now, all dairy and sheep farming, Masteron being the major town. The country roads hereaabouts are clever little roads; they don't go shooting up every hill in sight like those in Northland, they follow the rivers and wind their way along quiet, pretty valleys. Top marks to the Wairarapa country roads; they have even had a song written about them - 'country roads, oh, country roads, take me back...............'  We got to Masteron at 14:55hrs and you would think at this time on a saturday afternoon in a major town the place would be heaving - not a chance! All the shops are shut and if we had been 5mins later we wouldn't have even got a coffee! This apparently is a common NZ thing for country towns. No eating out tonight, it was the campsite kitchen and a bench outside in the evening sun and a bottle of wine (as well as some food that is). Can't remember the celebration reason for the wine but there must be one. It'll come to me....    That weather of yesterday: We were reading in the paper about the damage that storm has caused in other parts of the country, mainly the South Island  - major flooding on the West Coast of the South Island and also Electricty pylons blown down; campsites flooded etc. Sudden bad weather like that is not an uncommon feature in NZ through the summer - we just hope we continue to miss it all.         "
4,"A chalk and cheese day with 35kms of flat roads to begin with through the small towns of Carterton, Greytown and then Featherston where we had a late breakfast to put some energy reserves in our legs for the 10km climb up Rimutaka Hill at 555 metres. It was a lovely winding climb with a steady gradient only spoiled a little bit by the sunday traffic but they tended to come past in blocks - one slow car leading a trail of others all trying to get past it. Some great views from the top and there was a cafe there as well so a double bonus. From there we had a 3km descent then it was short ups and downs before a more gradual descent through the urbanisations of Upper Hutt and further down appropriately called Lower Hutt and on to the campsite.        Weatherwise it was a chalk and cheese day as well. After a cool night under clear skies it was very warm from the moment the sun came up and got hotter as the day went on - high 20'sC. It was a good job we got some breeze on the big climb to knock the edge off it otherwise that would have been a hard one. Then by 17:00hrs high clouds came over and a cool wind sprung up and it got really gusty through the evening. At the campsite we met the first cycle tourists we had seen since Auckland. A Welsh lad and his Australian girlfriend (who spoke with a Welsh accent - a rare combination). Got a text from Richard & Elaine: they are back in Auckland today, ready for their flight onto LA tomorrow. They have been horse riding and said they are a bit sore - so sat down for a12hr flight doesn't appear to be the best remedy, does it? Today's mildly interesting fact: Greytown was NZ's first planned inland town and is quite a pretty little place; a bit arty, crafty though. And something else: On the way up Rimutaka Hill, in a small layby, there was a car jack and handle. So, somewhere in NZ, there is a guy rummaging around his garage and searching his car and saying 'now, where the heck did I put that jack and handle? I had it when changed that wheel............doh!' Monday Jan12th - a day off in Wellington The problem with going into a city is that we tend to spend too much money and that was the case today. We both needed a new pair of cycle shorts as we had worn through one other pair. You always know it is time to change your shorts when the person riding behind you says 'do you know I can see your bum through those shorts' It's a bit like a rear stop light going out on your car; you need somebody behind to tell you. So a new pair of shorts each, that was the first big expense and there was no sale on either! Cycle shorts don't come cheap here comparitive to the UK. Then, we had to book the ferry to get across to Picton on the South Island; so, that's the second big expense (but much more essential in our opinion) - we are off tomorrow. Other than that we had a wander around, had our normal cafe coffee stop; we like Wellington, it's a lovely location by the bay and doesn't really seem to be like a capital city - office workers out for lunch sat outside cafes and along the harbourside, some off for a jog along the bay; all very laid back. We uploaded some more pics and generally tried to avoid going into any more shops and spending money apart from getting something for tea that is - and we got a bottle of wine to 'celebate' reaching Wellington (that's seems like a good enough reason doesn't it) Weatherwise we had a lovely hot day before it cooled down nicely with increasing cloud cover by late afternoon. We need it to remain calm though for the 3hr ferry crossing tomorrow; I, specifically do not do bouncing boats well at all.     "
5,"Apart from the weather the other upset of the day was having to fork out an extra 10$ for each bike; the Tourist Office where we booked the tickets never mentioned that. The weather, even though the rain had stopped by the time we were on the boat, spoilt the crossing as a) the views looking back to Wellington were nil and b) the views when we entered the Sounds of the South Island weren't much better - pity, perhaps we will have better luck on the return trip. At least it was a smooth crossing so I had no problems. There were 3 German cycle tourists on the ferry and 2 Brits from Worcester who were travelling light; they were over here for 3 weeks heading down to Christchurch. There were 2 other German cyclists at the Picton campsite and then 2 Swiss cyclists turned up who remembered seeing us up at Dargaville many weeks ago (they were on a bus at the time). Also at Picton we did spot 2 english touring bikes but not their owners so within half a day on the South Island we have seen more cyclist tourists than in the past 2 weeks. Then, after the 17:00hrs ferry docked 5 more cyclists turned up. We are starting to take over the campsite - on the tent site area we are the majority!      We arrived in Picton by 12:30 (a 3hr crossing) and after a lunchtime snack we went straight to the nearby campsite as we never planned to move straight on today anyway. That was good planning as the southerly wind was quite strong so it would have been quite a struggle. We will see what tomorrow brings as we may go for a walk on the Marlborough Sounds hills as the forecast is good but as at this evening it is very cool and windy - the long trousers are going on. Weds January 14th  -  a do nothing very much day A hot sunny day and a day which we did nothing much really. The provisional plan to go for a walk did not get progressed mainly because one member of the party (me again) was getting the early symptons of another throat infection so a visit to the pharmacy and plenty of rest was planned instead. I am going to have to visit the doc when we return home and find out what is going on in my throat. Jo's view is that I can't hack the pace she is setting and has promised to slow up a bit............cheek of it!  Her other view is that there is so much rubbish coming out of it then it is not surprising it is getting infected! So, in the morning after a late up we walked into town (about 500 metres), bought a throat gargling solution, had a coffee, went to the internet cafe (unfortunately we couldn't upload any pictures there; that will have to wait), bought some food, bought 3 books for 15$ in a sale and were back at the campsite by lunchtime. In the afternoon we did nothing really apart from sitting in the shade reading our new books and chatting; except Jo had found herself a really absorbing book so there was hardly a peek from her.  Of the cyclists here last night 2 have left, another 2 are catching tonights ferry - that leaves 7 of us of which at least 5 of us are having a real lazy day. We then found out there was a dutch cycling couple hidden away on the other side of the campsite who weren't moving either. All these cycle tourists and not a lot of cycling being done! Then off the evening ferry another 3 joined us so we are still the majority on the tent area. A warmer evening than yesterday so we didn't need the long trousers!     "
6,"Initially we will head down the East Coast to Kiakoura and then head inland around Christchurch and possibly towards Lake Tekapo area even though we have cycled there before (in 1999). After that we will have to see what unfolds. We are seriously considering riding at least part of the way back up the West Coast as we do love that area but will probably not cycle all the way back to Picton. Read on.....................
"
7,    We got some respite from the wind by stopping at a teahouse at Ward just before the final hill of the day which then dropped us down to the coast and our finish 1km down a gravel road to a farmhouse which has been running a popular self contained small bunkhouse with tent area for cyclists for a number of years now Just the 4 of us staying; there was a Swiss lad in residence who because of the wind decided he wasn't going anywhere today - wise decision. Scenically today there were lots of dry barren looking fields and hills today with higher mountains in the distance. The highest one around had snow patches around the top. This eastern side of the South Island and especially around Christchurch further south is going through a serious drought this summer which is probably ok for the wine growers around Blenheim but not for the poor arable and sheep farmers.     
8,"Luckily it isn't;  you have to expend some energy to see it. From where we were that first involved cycling 11kms down the valley on a gravel road that got very hilly for the last 4 kms before we arrived at a farmstead at the road end appropriately called 'Isolation House'. The views were great already - a wide gravel, nearly dry river bed (the River Waimu) surrounded by hills. From the house it was on with walking shoes for a 1hr+ 'walk' up the narrowing valley.          We say 'walk' but we were actually following the river with sometimes a narrow path on one side and sometimes on the other side so the river had to be crossed and recrossed a number of times; there are no bridges, we  just waded across - quite refreshing on a hot day like today. Sometimes there is no path at all so we just walked up the river bed. Of course after a lot of rain the route can be just plainly impossible. The first gorge we came to was impressive enough with 200 metre high limestone cliffs towering above us and the water cascading over a series of small waterfalls and over large boulders. Beyond here we turned off up a narrower stream and shortly after came to 100 metre high cliff face which first sight looked impassable. But the stream can actually be followed into the cliff face through a winding 4- 5 metre wide gap with the cliffs towering above us; this is Saw Cut Gorge - it went on like this for about 50 metres before the slitt widens out but with the cliffs still towering 100 metres or so above us - a truly amazing place and so unexpected and we had it all to ourselves. After spending some time there all we had to do then was retrace our back to the bikes with a dip into one of the many river pools on the way and then ride back to the bunkhouse where we had 2 new arrivals - the Dutch couple who were at Picton.       "
9,"     We stopped at the first cafe we came to after 16kms (there wasn't another for 55kms - remember that rule we have) and bumped into an English couple from the Isle of Wight. They had stopped at Ward last night and said that there were a good number of cycle tourists there - all heading south today. We overtook one shortly after who had stopped for a rest so by now we were the front runners and never got overtaken before Kaikoura - we were there by late lunchtime. We even forced ourselves to stop a few times on the way, to take pictures, admire some view, grab a snack, watch the seals at the large seal colony we passed and have a drink at another cafe just before Kaikoura. We were reluctant to stop for long because what was at the back of minds was 'what if this wind suddenly switches direction like the other day' - we would be a mite dissappointed to say the least.    The waves were really crashing onto the beach at Kaikoura with the wind whipping along but we found a sheltered tent spot on a campsite about 50metres back from the beach.The seas were so rough today that the Whale & Dolpin watching boats never ventured out. But, then about 19:00hrs as we were eating out (a saturday night treat) the wind suddenly died completely down and we had a very pleasant evening to finish the day -  those waves were still crashing on the beach and making a heck of a noise but they didn't stop us sleeping.  A cycle tourists tale............. The english couple we met today had a great story to tell when they were on a gravel road on the West Coast of the North Island above New Plymouth. Overnight rain had badly flooded some sections. Cars couldn't get through but they waded through the first 100metres section fine, carrying their bikes and bags on separate trips. Before the next 150metre flooded section a farmer had said to them 'once you get through that you will be ok' - wrong! They waded through up to their chests pulling their baggage along in a plastic container they had found by the roadside. They got through and then found there were even worse sections ahead so they went back to where the farmer was and he put them up for the night. They became overnight celebrities getting their picture in the local paper. The next day the flood waters had fully receded so they could carry on without a problem. Perhaps that's one of the other extremes of cycle touring.   "
10,"Sunday Jan 18th - waiting to see the whales A cloudy and cooler day with some brief spots of rain at times but there was hardly any wind and the sea looked quite calm which we thought would be good news as Jo was booked on the 12:30 boat to go Whale watching. I was definitely not going as I have mentioned before I do not do bouncing boats. The lady at the Info Centre said when we booked the trip that I could go in a small plane or a helicopter instead. She definitely gave me that 'what a wimp look' when I said I don't do bouncing things in the air either - I am a total land lubber. It turned out that all the sailings through the morning including Jo's were cancelled because as they stated 'it was like a washing machine out there with strong winds' So she is provisionally booked on the 07:45 one tomorrow morning; we shall have to wait and see and anyway an extra day here is no hardship - Kaikoura is a very pleasant place. Also an extra day's rest will be something of a blessing for me as I haven't shook this throat problem off yet and really should get myself a few days rest. It's a visit to the doc tomorrow if I am no better. So we spent some time at the Internet Cafe getting our pics downloaded to a CD that we will send home and we also uploaded some more pics onto the website; did some shopping and spent the rest of the day lazing around. Jo has finished the book that absorbed her -  'Havelock Junction by Joe Donnelly' (a scary one) and swopped another book she has for one from Leelo the German lady cyclist on the site. Doing swops with other people or at campsites,backpacker places and even secondhand shops is a popular process for getting books when travelling like this. Listened to our radio in the afternoon and tuned in to Radio Kiakoura 88FM transmitting from the Blue Pacific pub 100 metres down the road - so we got excellent reception. It plays non-stop music, non-stop in that there is no talking between the records but there is a 15sec silent gap; perhaps they have only one machine! They played a wide variety of music; one minute REM and two records later a piano recital of 'I've got you under my skin' Then, halfway through one record the music suddenly stopped and we went into the 'Bible for Life' program with Jim. We could hear him eventually when he got closer to the microphone. Pity we can't be at the Blue Pacific next saturday night as it is 'Get Naked' night......don't get excited, it's a speed sheep shearing competition. Loved the sign outside the Dolphin Watching place. Under the sea conditions heading it said 'Swelly and sea sicky' Monday 19th January - Whale watching eventually Jo was off by 07:00hrs, along with Leelo the German lady, to go Whale watching; I was firmly rooted in bed and didn't move for another good hour and more. They got to see 2 Sperm Whales, both about 18 metres long, one of whom had a white spot on his head and was well known to the boat crew so was naturally called 'Spot' These are male Whales who stay in this area all year round, not that far off the coast where the ocean floor suddenly plummets. The sea was a bit rough out there and a few people (not strong stomach Jo) were sick; justifies my decision not to go, me thinks. Jo's view of the trip: fantastic, awesome, well worth the money for the 3hr trip - she also saw an Albatross out there. Jo says the photos don't do justice to what she saw and she spent more time looking than taking pictures. She also says she doesn't have a zoom lens on her camera (I think that is directed at me as a complaint) For more whales info etc see........ www.whalewatch.co.nz          I stayed firmly rooted on land and did nothing much apart from going to see the doc in the afternoon who for 40$ didn't really tell me a lot or give me anything other than some suggestions for early treatment if it occurs again. He thinks it is a viral infection and that the cycling in the hot dry weather may be aggravating it -  I am not interested in that conclusion! Weather wise we had a warm cloudy quiet day to begin with but then by lunchtime a cool southerly change occurred, the seas got rough again so the boats were cancelled and then by mid-afternoon it started to rain and rain some more well into the night with temperatures plummeting so trousers and long sleeves were required."
11,"Brrrrrrrrrrr.......what a cold, wet start to the day. Leelo was off wrapped up in waterproofs but we weren't. We haven't flown to the otherside of the world to cycle in this sort of weather; we can do that at home! Another day's rest would be useful for me as well. Shock, horror - it was on with long trousers, long sleeved shirt, jumper and goretex and bigger shock, horror - it was on with socks and shoes as well. The rain did ease off later to blustery showers and it did warm up somewhat as well. Highest temp. today was about 15'C All the Whale boat sailings were cancelled - that really goes without saying.  So, a do nothing very much day was the best option under the circumstances; coffee, food shopping, internet, post some cards and the CD home and sit in the campsite TV lounge room reading and getting bags of rest. Weds January 21st - it's another cold wet one For today's diary read yesterday's - about the only difference being we went to a different cafe for our coffee. Weatherwise about the same naffness but colder and healthwise some improvement after buying yet more stuff to throw down my throat. Still wrapped up but the weather forecast for tomorrow is for a definite improvement - heard that one before. NZ weather today: Major storms with gales up to 120kph on the lower half of the North Island with Wellington getting all of January's normal rainfall in 24hrs: all ferries cancelled, trees and power lines down in some areas.On the South Island lovely warm unbroken sunshine on the Western side but cold, coudy and wet on a lot of the Eastern side with Kaikoura registering the lowest temperature anywhere on both islands at 11'C - yes, you heard right - 11'C. It's probably about that back home in the UK! We kept our Goretex jackets on all day. Thursday Jan22nd - another day in Kaikoura Woke up to blue skies, white clouds and no rain and thought great......except, Jo woke up with a sore throat and not feeling too good. The conclusion was 'looks like we are here for another day at least' Well it was warm so that was a good change and where there was nothing but cloud yesterday the mountains today were clear initially and covered in a blanket of snow on the higher levels; I will repeat that...SNOW. Told you it was cold yesterday. One couple who had been here for 2 days didn't even know that there were mountains behind those clouds; this morning was the first time there had seen them. So we did our customary walk into town for a coffee and some food, sat on the pebbly beach for a while in the sun and then lazed around even more for the rest of the day.  Chatted with Robyn, a girl cyclist from Melbourne coming to the end of a 4 week trip around the South Island.       "
12,"Robyn the Aussie cyclist was heading up SH1 but that busy road was not for us so we turned off onto the inland road which gradually over 30kms or so rose up to approx 400+metres with ups and downs on the way. We were amongst the lower slopes of the coastal mountains dropping down and crossing big wide gravel river beds that must be a torrent of water in winter time -  would love to see them in that state. This road (SH70) was only totally tar sealed about 2 years ago; the only facilities on route was the Mt Lyford Ski Lodge after 55kms where we got a very welcome drink. Apart from that there were just scattered farmsteads with sheep, cattle and deer in the high pastures with mountains in the background. Even when we got to the highest point the road didn't desend straight way it just kept dipping and rising across the high plateau area before we finally got our reward for all the previous hard work. The descending though was not easy because we then got a gusty Nor'wester hitting us side on so we were a bit battered about when we finally finished. It was late afternoon when we got to the small township of Waiau and a bit of a dump of a camping site but we weren't bothered as it was somewhere to collapse and  the showers were good and that is the most important criteria for us. We weren't bothered about cooking either so we decided to eat out. The local pub was doing 'All day breakfasts' so at 19:30hrs we had a full breakfast with beers - our tasebuds had gone haywire!  An early night was called for. P.S.  Even with all the hardships today this was a great day's ride on a beautiful route. Highly recommended to all cyclists but make sure you are not recovering from any throat infection before you do it. P.P.S If you want a good night's sleep then don't stop at Waiau camping ground; there were about 6 dogs tethered up nearby and they caused one heck of a rumpus through the night. Rotherham about 10kms west had a neat looking little campsite by the pub; at least any pub noise would not go on through the night.       "
13,"We were off by 08:30hrs on quiet easy roads for 22kms to Culverden for an early coffee stop and although we were on the Hanmer Springs to Christchurch highway from here it wasn't too busy. Some long straights and a few small hills to Waikari and another cafe turned up on time - 'The Yorkshire Teapot' and seeing as we are from Yorkshire then we couldn't possibly pass it by could we, so we had a cup of tea which was good but not as good as Yorkshire Tea made with Yorkshire watta (if you are not a Yorky then you can give that last comment a miss).       Jo particularly liked the countryside we were passing through early today; wide open valleys surrounded by low hills with the mountains further away to the west. Around Waikari it was all looking very parched indeed - brown sheep in brown fields; most of the Canterbury region from this point southwards has been having severe drought conditions for some time now.  A final short climb after Waikari took us over Weka Pass and then we had some good descending through a lovely limestone gorge into the Wairapa wine valley and onto SH1 and down to Amberley. We were in the swing of it now and cracked on to Rangiora another 25kms along the Inland Scenic Route and into the first cafe on the high street we found where Jo went for a bowl of Latte (a large bowl) and downed it quicker than me with my standard size glass - just no style as we sat in this upmarket cafe (it had waiters) and she lifted the bowl to her mouth gulping it down. Sometimes one just has to look the other way - 'who? that lady cyclist with me?' 'no, I just met her on the road a while back' We didn't know where the campsite was so stopped two dutch cycle tourists to ask them and they immediately said you must be the two english cyclists who Robyn told us about; they had met her yesterday. They also had their story to tell about that Nor'wester yesterday; such was it's strength (they had it as a headwind) it reduced them to 5kph!  The wind cooled things down a lot in the evening so we sat in the TV room with the doors shut and with Jo getting steadily worse - looks like she's coming down with a cold. Update: yes, she definitely has a full on head cold so we're almost certainly going nowhere tomorrow.  Futher update: we had a beautiful red sky sunset.    Sunday January 25th - a restful day off Woke up to total cloud cover and the sound of drizzle on the tent and Jo coughing and sputtering and feeling no better so no rush to get up seeing as weren't moving on. Some light drizzle on and off through the day and we never saw the sun but it was warm enough. The only bit of activity was me being sent to the supermarket with a shopping list which you think would be an easy enough task.......no. I managed to forget the most important item on the list (some boiled sweets for Jo's throat). No excuse really; I just put it down to the fact that I get bored in supermarkets after about 15mins and I must have spent at least 5mins of that trying to decide which type of rice to buy - indecisive?.......moi?, I used to be but I am not so sure now. The Dutch lad who was at the barking dog campsite turned up and we had a good chat in the evening. He had  a bad night's sleep on another campsite last night as well with loud music being the disturbance this time. No problems here though. Monday 26th January - waiting for Jo to get better Jo was a bit better today but not well enough to do much beyond cycling into town; the weather was brighter today until mid-afternoon when it clouded over and cooled down so we did about as much as we did yesterday. This time, though, we both went to the supermarket and I was told to carry the basket and not to pick anything up without asking first - the result being that we got everything we needed!  Outside the supermarket a chap came up to us as he had spotted our 'Bob Jackson' bikes; he used to have a Bob Jackson bike that he had bought from an English guy who had emigrated here. He doesn't have it anymore and has since regretted selling it as he was full of praise for it - totally agree. It rained in the evening and the forecast for the next few days isn't good and this area is supposed to having a drought! Well at least the locals are happy.
"
14,"We were on the Inland Scenic Route but there was nothing scenic about it; we had low, low mist with the rain. At least the riding wasn't taxing as there was very little wind and only a couple of gentle rises. On a clear day there are views of the mountains to the west and the Canterbury Plains to the east - so we understand. There was a cafe at Oxford so we had an early lunch of meat pie, chips and a pot of tea; very welcome except the lady made the tea with Earl Grey which somehow seems out of place and a bit upmarket for pie and chips - but it all went down well nevertheless. A wet, bedraggled girl cycle tourist turned up as were leaving but she could only muster half a smile to our greeting - perhaps she was having a bad day. A customer in the cafe told us about a small backpackers place just up the road as we had decided we weren't going any further in this rain - it was bouncing down. The backpackers was ideal with just a few rooms, lounge, kitchen etc - $48 for a double room. The lady who ran it slept in a caravan in her garden. Then Murphy's Law struck again; the rain stopped as soon as we had stated to unpack and it started to get warmer and brighter (brighter meaning cars didn't need their headights on - not sunnier). That didn't really matter though as another 30-40kms might have been too much for Jo as she still had that niggling cough to contend with. So we lazed the rest of the day away apart from going out to the shop to get something for tea. Which was when Murphy's Law struck for the third time today as it was fine when we went in the shop but raining again for our walk back. Some days are just like that aren't they? Anyway we bought a bottle of wine; we needed something to cheer us up.
"
15,"   But in the morning like all true champions she was ready for the off and to help us along today we had gentle, quiet roads and just a little helpful breeze so nothing too taxing which is just what we both wanted. Jo didn't want anything too hard to start her coughing off and I didn't want my eardrums damaged anymore. We also had pleasant tempertaures, just about total cloud cover but no rain. The sun did try to come out a few times but not with much success.  We finished by lunchtime so had the remainder of the day to rest and get more recovery time in the very picturesque surroundings of Rakaia Gorge which was also a memory trip for us. We were last here about 5 yrs and 1 week ago on our very first cycling trip to NZ; this was our first campsite then after leaving Christchurch. A total contrast to last night as tonight only cost us $5, but then we only got toilets and cold water here - but what lovely surroundings. We followed the Inland Scenic marked route all day today and with better views than dismal yesterday. The Waimakariri Gorge was impressive after 15kms but beaten by Rakaia Gorge into second place. The small place of Glenturrel with it's one shop was the only place to get some food (there's is nothing at Rakaia Gorge); so we stocked up there.  As there were no kitchen facilities here we were camp cooking on a stove for about the first time this trip; this duty falls to me as I am a bit of a 'one pan' cooking expert if I say so myself. My big problem though is I tend not to read the labels so the boil in the bag rice we had was not, if you see what I mean. Tasted just as good I thought but Jo complained because it was a bit soggy as I couldn't drain it properly - we don't carry a collander with us. Two blokes on the campsite came back from their fishing trip on the river with 2 x 5+kg salmon; they also caught 2 yesterday. Now that would have been nice with our rice, soggy or not.     "
16,"She was a lot better through the night and we both managed to get a good night's sleep; think we are over the worse of it now. Can't imagine though what we have spent on doctor's fees and medicines over the past week or so; we seemed to visit a Pharmacy in about every town we passed through. All sorts of advice and help from other  people: got a lemon from a lady at Rakaia Gorge; the campsite owner at Rangiora sweared by Stones Ginger Wine, so Jo got a glass of that from her.  Back to today: we didn't storm along initially though; that steep climb started immediately outside the campsite so we had no chance to get warmed up first. It was a brute as well, graded for cars, not for fully loaded cycle tourists. We really must have a word with these highway planners - bet you none of them are cyclists! We left the campsite about 08:15hrs with the mist rolling down into the gorge so as we got higher the views inland were great with layers of mist hanging in the valley and gorge area. Whilst we are talking about the gorge - a lady on the campsite was telling us that about a week ago after heavy rains in the mountains the river became a torrent of grey water spreading from bank to bank (it normally runs in one channel with the rest of it being gravel). Well, when we stopped at a small store/cafe down the road the lady there showed us a photograph that they had taken of that flood; what an amazing transformation of the river - just a pity we can't show you the picture to highlight the difference. We would just love to see a river like that in full flow. We only stopped twice for any length of time; the first time for a meat pie and pot of tea (not Earl Grey this time you will be pleased to hear) at the small store/cafe in the middle of nowhere; the second time for a coffee at Maryfield the only settlement we passed, though there were facilities and a camping ground at Mt Somers, 1km off our route. So it was only 13:00hrs when we rolled into Geraldine which gave us plenty of time after putting the tent up and having a shower to get some clothes washing done (in the machine), walk the 200 metres into town for a coffee and get some food shopping done, reply to e:mails and get back just in time to get the clothes off the washing line as rain arrived to remove the warm sunshine that had appeared 2 hrs earlier. All that was after a morning of just about total cloud cover. What a mixture of weather today! Temperatures anywhere between 15 & 22'C depending on whether it was mist, cloud, sun or rain. Other cyclists today: One dutch chap aleady on the campsite, older than us, who spends about 9 months of the year cycle touring - where he hasn't been is not worth mentioning. One young lad and then a young couple turned up later in the rain but we never saw the couple again - they must have taken a cabin (unless they were all taken and they went elsewhere).  The weather forecast for tomorrow is not good. Sorry there are no more pictures for the moment; Internet facilities for uploading pictures are hard to come by out in the country areas- it my be a while yet before we can upload some more.       "
17,"Plan A was to ride the 90kms to Lake Tekapo today but after lots of rain from yesterday evening through the night and with the skies very leaden looking in the early morning as though there was a tanker full of water just waiting to be dropped on us we reverted to Plan B. Plan B was not to rush off anywhere and see what happened within the first couple of hours or so and if it didn't improve then we would stay here for the day but we really didn't want to kick our heels in Geraldine even though it was a pleasant enough place so we reverted to Plan C. Plan C was to ride to Fairlie, about halfway to Lake Tekapo and take a chance with the weather as it did look slightly brighter by 10:00hrs (we are talking shades of grey here).There would be no shelter on route apart from a cafe about 8kms before Fairlie so if it did come on heavy then we would just have to lump it. So, after a coffee in town we went for it. We were back into hilly country now after the last few days of the Canterbury plains but Jo's coughing had just about cleared up (though she did have some bother through the night) so the hills shouldn't be a problem, apart from pain to the legs that is after the recent easy days. We were headed into the Mackenzie high plains country so naturally enough we had some climbing to do and some descending and some more climbing and so on....... The cafe was a welcome stop at the top of the final climb with some greyish long distance views with the low cloud and Fairlie was just a descent and a level road away where the dutch lad who we last saw at Rangiora was already in residence; he had diverted to Christchurch before heading this way. Later on a Yorky cyclist lad turned up (from Normanton); he was 2 weeks into a 3 month trip. The sun actually appeared in the afternoon and it got quite hot at times until the cloud finally won the battle later in the day and dominated the sky. It looks like the hot summer has temporarily stopped, the forecast for next week is for more low pressure systems but that's not as bad as it sounds. The temperatures are ideal for cycling in and if we can have the rain when we are not cycling then everybody will be happy. The only downside is that we lose the quality of the views with the low cloud but seeing as we have been this way before and seen the countryside in all it's sunny glory then that's no big deal for us. We are riding in shorts and sandals and when we heard from back home that it was snowing, icy and windy then what have we got to complain about. The only concern we have is that we had another puncture today (Jo again) and it's the third time an inner tube has split around the valve area making it totally unusable - we don't understand it. We are down to our last spare tube now and the chances of getting any more could be a week away. Keep your figures crossed.   "
18,"Boy, did it rain last night. It started about 19:00hrs and rained all night; initially very heavy, so heavy it couldn't drain through the ground quick enough with the result we got lots of standing water - it was squelch, squelch back to the tent at bedtime. We got some seepage through the ground sheet but nothing drastic and luckily the rain did ease down through the night but it was still raining and drizzling until after 10:00hrs this morning. So once more the plans were revised from a provisional 90+kms to Twizel to only going as far as Lake Tekapo. We were the last cyclists to leave; it was well after 11:00hrs when we finally left Fairlie after having a coffee in town first. The mist and cloud were well down and we still got some on and off drizzle for a while on the 21kms to the small settlement of Burkes Pass with the only cafe on route there so in we went and seeing as the all day breakfast was only $8.50 we went for that and it was just fine. We had been rising steadily up until now and after here another 4kms and a couple of steepish sections took us over Burkes Pass itself and a short descent onto the high plains towards Lake Tekapo and wonder of wonders we were into quite a bit of blue sky and warm sushine.The misty cloudy stuff seemed to finish at the top of Burkes Pass just as the lady at the cafe had promised - what a difference between the two sides. The other significant difference was on the east side we had a fairly typical high country valley with the road winding along and crossing various streams and the hills close by but on the west side the flat plains stretched far away to the mountains in the distant. If you got the wind in the wrong direction up here it would be purgatory but luckily we were getting an easterly wind today and seeing as we were headed roughly westwards then everybody was reasonably happy except of course the 3 cyclists we saw going the other way who were definitely having a harder time of it.    Lake Tekapo had a lovely turquoise colour to it (because it is glacial water) even though it wasn't a full sun day; it looks even better when it is. We got a cabin at the campsite by the lake because Jo said so as there was the likelihood of more rain - and it did rain in the evening for a while and then through the night again. The Finance Director objected but he was unceremoniously overruled and put in his place and some might say 'about time too' The Yorky lad was at Lake Tekapo when we arrived; he was just off to climb a hill {he must have energy to burn, but then he is young). We saw the Dutch lad at Burkes Pass; he had been pulled over by a police car for not wearing a helmet and he turned up at Lake Tekapo late in the day. Perhaps he was taken in for questioning: 'Now, young man, you may be able to cycle all over Europe without a  helmet where there are millions more cars but here in NZ you are by law required to wear a helmet at all times so when you get knocked off by a idiot in a speeding car at least you can say you made the effort though it almost certainly won't have made the slightest bit of difference. Now doesn't that make sense, what do you say?............................ Just getting my twopennyworth in for personal liberty. For those who don't know us we ride with helmets all the time but that's our choice!  Seeing as we spent extra money to have a cabin we also bought a bottle of wine to celebrate having a cabin or was it to compensate for last night's rain; doesn't really matter, either one will do. Funny that, isn't it - once you have broken the budget it's not an issue breaking it further. Jo has finished reading 'The Road to McCarthy' by Pete McCarthy - a hilarious travelogue sequel to 'McCarthy's Bar' - she gives it 11 out of 10. At least now we won't have those embarassing moments when she chuckles away to herself whilst sat in a campsite TV lounge with other people wondering if that woman should be staying up this late; shouldn't that man with her be looking after her better? The big problem now though is that whatever book you are reading you have to carry yourself. Now that McCarthy book is one heavy book and it's my turn to read it.   "
19,"An American guy quizzed the Information Centre lady there on whereabouts the postcard picture of Mt Cook was taken from. It was certainly very difficult for him to believe her when she said it was from just 100 metres away. Anybody passing through today would just have to make do with the  postcard view. We were late off again this morning as we first went to the internet place to upload some more pictures and then had a coffee as there was nowhere between Lake Tekapo and Twizel and we also got collared by a dutch couple living in NZ wanting to know about our trip. So, it was after 11:00hrs when we finally got going; these late starts are becoming a bad habit. We had lovely easy roads for a lot of the way, couresty of the hydro-electric canal road and a generally helpful wind and nothing to detain us anymore so we just kept going to try and get as much distance as possible before the rains came on; we got 1.5hrs of dry before they started. No views to grab our attention and only the Salmon Farm on the hydro waterway caused us to stop momentarily just as a guy was netting one huge salmon from one of the ponds. The farm's claim to fame supposedly being it is the highest salmon farm in the world (but how do they know that).       We had initially planned to get to Omarama (about 30kms beyond Twizel) and we definitely weren't making the 80kms diversion up to Mt Cook itself in this weather and anyway we have been up there before in lovely sunny weather and seen it in all its glory. The result of today was that we got to Twizel before 14:00hrs, had a coffee and pondered about the weather for a short while and decided it was not going to stop raining (and it didn't) so we packed in at the small camping ground a short walk away from the town centre.  The next decision was tent or other accommodation. The Yorky lad had arrived before us had been given the luxury of pitching his tent in the dry under a caravan awning; there was only one of those available. We had a lovely dry tent and if we pitched it then clearly we would be in breach of Rule27 which states 'if you arrive at your destination in pouring rain and it is unlikely to stop then non-tented accommodation must be sought' We had no desire to break this rule and anyway they had  on offer a bed with sheets - oh, lovely, lovely clean white sheets (sorry about that, got carried away there for a moment). It was also ensuite and had shared cooking facilities for only $10 more than last night. No contest - even the Finance Director didn't object but then he knows his place now.  I was sent to the supermarket with a list and I'm getting good at this; I came back with everything on the list.
"
20,"Well we did get the sun for the rest of the day and also a helpful wind and also some beautiful scenery so life was really wonderful. But all good things must come to an end because by the afternoon the wind shifted, picked up a pace, then later dark clouds appeared over the mountains accompanied by rumbles of thunder and we got some rain and then slowly but surely the cloud cover increased and the sun disappeared.........the question is when will we see it again?      We managed to get away before 09:00hrs this morning, there was nothing to delay us. A very quiet start with no wind and mist down to our ankles, so much so that Jo put her rear light on for a while. We flew the 30kms to Omarama for our early coffee and pie stop. Omarama is  called 'the place of light' and it really was; basking under a sunny blue sky with the surrounding hills in cloud. It's NZ's gliding centre. From here we went east; in 1999 we went south over Lindis Pass so we thought we would have a change. We were heading down the Waitaki valley and apart from one 2km climb there were only slight undulations and hardly any traffic at all. The scenery reminded us of the Scottish Highlands and sure enough it was the Scottish Highlands as the first lake was called Benmore and the second one Aviemore. The third lake spoilt the party as that was called Waitaki - all 3 lakes created by 3 hydro-electric dams. We had our lunch stop at Otematata on a bench/table  made for children, naturally enough in the childrens playground. Old short legs could easily fit in but I had to sit sideways.We got to Kurow by 14:00hrs which was dead good timing as the wind shifted 5mins later (that would have made it a headwind). The young english cycling couple (from Sheffield) behind us got 10kms of that. We had a coffee, we had a huge ice-cream (because of the sunshine & heat), replied to e:mails, did food shopping, showered, rested, machine washed some clothes and dried them in the dryer (because of the rain), had tea, read, chatted and went to bed - and so endeth another day.   "
21,"It was decision time when we got to Duntroon, 25kms down the valley, having our coffee and pie in the Flying Pig Cafe. Do we turn off here and head over Danskey's Pass (our original plan), a rough gravel road climbing up into the cloud and mist; we had been warned off this road 'too steep and rough' was another cyclists view. Or, do we head down to Oamaru on the coast, a large town where we will be able to get more spare inner tubes - now a necessity. We haven't been to Oamaru before and neither have we been along the coast from there to Dunedin. Jo would also like to revisit the Catlins region between Dunedin and Invercargill. So there we have it, another revised plan to get to Cape Bluff. It may take us longer but what the heck, we are in no rush. We got to Oamaru by lunchtime, had a cafe snack and bought a map to check out our intended route from here (we haven't needed a map so far on the South Island). Oamaru looked a pleasant place with lots of period buildings and as the drizzle got heavier and as there was a campsite nearby we thought 'let's have a look around this place rather than carry on' - so we packed in. Oamaru has quite a history as a old port developed primarily for the wool trade with some interesting period buildings in the old dock area and then similar financial buildings in the town centre. We had a good wander around in the afternoon and bought some more inner tubes as well; so this revised route to here has been  worthwhile and some compensation for the naffness of the weather. The English couple from last night turned up later and also a German couple who we last saw in Picton. We also got caught up, when riding into Oamaru, by an Aussie from Queensland out for a training ride; he was over here visiting friends locally. He was complaining about how cold it was compared to home and commented 'you'll feel right at home with this weather won't you; just like your English summer' - cheeky so and so (well he was nearly right). But at least we don't get heavy rain like they do up in Queensland, or the extreme heat, or the mossies, or the snakes, or ..................     "
22,"So, we followed SH1, which wasn't too bad at all. The traffic seemed to come in bursts and there was a good hard shoulder for 90% of the way. Notwithstanding the conditions there were also some good coastal views at times, a mite dull though. We intended to take a minor coastal road for about 20kms; the turnoff was just outside Oamaru but the Tour Leader missed it and didn't realise it until 5kms further on. Cries of 'sack him' were heard from a disgruntled tour member but he paid no attention. The morning coffee and pie stop was at the general store at Hampden where the lady in there recognised our Yorkshire accents; she comes from Huddersfied (about 25kms away from us). We stopped again shortly after to look at the Moeraki boulders, along with a couple of coach loads of tourists and quantities of campervan people. They are unique, naturally formed, spherical boulders scattered aound on the beach - worth the visit; we certainly have seen nothing like them before. We stopped again at a picnic table spot by a beach to have our lunch (but with our jackets on!) and then at Palmerston after 60+kms we stopped again to have a pot of tea. As you can see weren't rushing anywhere and certainly now had no intention of getting to Dunedin today so at Waikouaiti we called it a day just as the sun was breaking through.      The campsite was 3kms away by the beach so first we rode down to check it out for accommodation options and then we rode back again into town get some food - think we just liked the idea of riding in sunshine. We took the option of an on-site caravan for $32 even though it was sunny as this forecasted south westerly change could potentially bring a lot of rain overnight and it will certainly get a lot colder - so the lady in the store said. It was lovely now though so we walked down to the beach later and just sat on the sand and watched the waves for a while enjoying the sunshine as we didn't know how long it would last. The answer was 2.5hrs because by 17:00hrs it clouded over, cooled down and we got some brief rain, and then it brightened up again and then overnight the sun came out (no, it didn't - just checking to see if you are reading all of this nonense) Today's bit off additional info: The Wiakouaiti district's claim to fame is that here, on this very beach, in 1840, the first European settlers arrived on the South Island.     "
23,"We took the scenic coastal route via Karitane and when we got to the turnoff after 4kms there was a sign there saying 'cyclists route to Dunedin'. What it should have said underneath, in big bold letters, was 'but very hilly'                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      It initially climbed steeply after Karitane to a lookout (lovely views back) and then undulated, steeply at times. Not for nothing is it called 'The Rollar Coaster Road' in the brochure. Worth all the effort though as the views were great and it was very quiet but glad we were going south as it certainly looked to be harder the opposite way.       We hit the highway again at Evansdale and had a coffee stop and then another 3kms down the road was another sign 'cyclists route to Dunedin' and another gem of a route. This time though it was a lovely winding 10kms approx climb on a quiet road with a nice steady gradient; once again top notch views back and then on the other side views down to the Otago peninsular and then to Dunedin itself.      We swept down into Dunedin, followed a cycle lane to the town centre and hit the first cafe we spotted in the Octogan (the central hub of Dunedin). All the hard work done for the day we thought..........wrong! We went to the Info Centre to get directions to the nearest campsite (about 3kms away). The guy there said 'just follow the road outside of here up the hill and keep going, it's on the Kaikorai Valley road' You would think with that sort of name that there wouldn't be much climbing to do. Well, to those of you ignorant of Dunedin, let us tell you that it is built on hills. The road from the town centre just went straight up and up and up.......even the buses were struggling. Jo would have managed it but she got collared by the traffic lights changing and just couldn't get going again from a standing start so she had to walk the final section. What an absolute stinker! It's called Stuart Street and it will forever remain in our memory. Bet the guy at the Info Centre was quietly sniggering away as we left and saying to himself  'that's yet more cyclists I have sent that way - I'll probably break my record this season at this rate' What do we care - we are having a day off tomorrow after a 10 day roll. At least Stuart Street is not as steep as the steepest street in the world, which also happens to be in Dunedin - Baldwin Street, with the steepest bit at 1 in 1.266 - We are not even attempting it! Guess which place in all of NZ was the coldest place today at only 15'C - wouldn't mind but it was sunny as well. Friday 6th February - Waitangi Day It's a Bank Holiday when NZlanders celebrate the birth of their nation - the signing of a treaty with the Maori's back in 18something. We thought we were going to get a hot sunny day as it started off with bright blue skies and the TV weather forecast last night said temps up to 25'C. Guess what?.....wrong again. It clouded over within the hour, got windy and cool and only warmed up by mid-afternoon, under a totally cloudy sky, when the wind dropped and then we had bright blue sky by evening - this is crazy weather. We intended today as mainly a rest day but we did walk into town, DOWN Stuart Street, had a wander about and amongst other things we bought a lightweight groundsheet for the tent as the floor fabric is definitely going and we do need more protection when the ground gets soggy. Rather than try and find out where the buses went from we got a taxi back UP Stuart Street (the easy way) to the campsite by mid-afternoon and slobbed the rest of the day away. Information from the taxi driver: In the wagon and 4 horses days they needed to change horses twice before they got to the top of Stuart Street. God knows how they got down the hill; those poor horses must have wearing out shoes in double quick time skidding to a halt so they didn't finish up in the sea. Think we are becoming obsessed with that stupid street.     "
24,"We left about 09:00hrs and didn't finish until about 16:00hrs and actually did about 12-15kms more than the shortest distance between the 2 towns, mainly to avoid the State Highway for as much as possible and also we wanted to avoid the tough 10kms hilly gravel section that the marked Southern Scenic route takes from Taieri Mouth on the coast (and that the Lonely Plant guide shows). We had been told bad stories about that part of the route and had also read another cyclist's travelogue of their time on it. So where did we go.....well we'll tell you. Seeing as we had already gained some height getting up Stuart Street (can't get that blasted street out of our heads) we were determined not to lose that. So, from the campsite we climbed even further, up Three Mile Hill Road, which is exactly what it is called. Not as steep as Stuart Street (there we go again) and it took us up high away from Dunedin. So high that there were snow gates to close the road in winter. The reward for our effort, apart from the views, was a great descent down to the Taieri Plain and some quiet, flattish roads which without the wind would have been dead easy - but they weren't.    Nowhere for our morning coffee stop though and it was about 12:00hrs when we hit the State Highway before  Waihola where there was a timely cafe so we had some lunch - toasted Panini's and a big bowl of wedges with sour cream and a pot of tea. We were filled up after that and when the going got tough later on we reaped the benefit of getting lots of fuel inside us. At the small town of Milton after 60+kms we considered stopping because of the wind but the campsite there was a dog's dinner so we carried on as the wind got stronger and the road got hillier and then finally finished off with a descent into Balcultha, the largest town around this area, and with an excellent campsite. We knew that because we last stopped here 5 years ago. We added a couple of kms on by riding down to the supermarket and back and naturally bought a bottle of wine to reward us for either or both of the following:- a) the hard work done today b) not having to go up Stuart Street ever again We could have made it a 100kms for the day as we forgot to get some yoghurt but neither of us wanted yoghurt that badly to go back to the supermarket. Oh, and weatherwise apart from the wind we got a lot of cloud early on with increasing sunny spells but temperatures always coolish; mid to high teens only. But this NZ sun is incredible as I forgot to put any sun cream on and yet got burnt sllghtly. More bits of info from yesterday: We met a young english couple in the campsite kitchen who we last saw at Hihi beach on the North Island before Xmas. We liked Dunedin (apart from Stuart Street), it has some impressive buildings (the railway station particularly) and a nice feel to it. But it does get some naff weather at times being this far south.
"
25,"Our original plan was only to cycle 60kms or so to Papatowai so we had a lazy start, a late breakfast, a chat with a dutch girl cyclist on the campsite, some internet time at the Tourist Office, a coffee and a visit to the 'Warehouse' store, purveyor of all things cheap and as their slogan goes 'where everybody gets a bargain and there's a money back guarantee' And what a bargain I got - I needed a new pair of jandals (or in english; flip-flops). The price was only $3.99 but at checkout with a sales deduction we were only charged $1.55 (about 60p). Now that's what we call a bargain and don't bother with the money back guarantee at that price. We finally left about 11:30hrs to do battle with the wind and hills and passing rain showers -  but there was a lot of blue sky about as well. Cyclists going the other way were: a couple towing a baby trailer, a young girl flying along with the tailwind. Don't you just hate that when you are struggling along into a headwind and cyclist(s) going the other way are expending no energy whatssoever and going twice the speed you are and what makes it even worse is that they have a huge grin on their face and are waving away very cheerfully as if to say 'bet you wish you were going our way' - YES WE DO! - Are you happy now. We also chatted with a young dutch couple in a cafe at Owaka who were also heading the opposite way and they had only had one day of headwind in the last week or so - and that was their rest day anyway. Think we are starting to get a phobia about headwinds as well as Stuart Street (told you we couldn't get that street out of our heads). So, at Owaka we were just looking around and Jo nipped in to look around a Quilt craft shop and whilst I dawdled about outside I spotted a backpackers place over the road and wandered over to have a look. It looked good and the weather didn't look good so I put it to the rest of the committee and the decision was easy - we called a halt and took a room at the backpackers.

26,"For some reason I was looking back through this journal and spotted that this entry and the next one had nothing in it - no words or pictures; zilch, zero, absolutely nothing. I just can't explain it. I definitely put something in there initially. I don't have the diary anymore so rather than just try and cobble something together I have included a few pictures instead. Sorry about that.I can't even remember the reason for the 'shame about the tailwind' heading either.           "
27,"For some reason I was looking back through this journal and spotted that this entry and the previous one had nothing in it - no words or pictures; zilch, zero, absolutely nothing. I just can't explain it. I definitely put something in there initially. I don't have the diary anymore so rather than just try and cobble something together' I have included a few pictures instead. Sorry about that. Briefly: we went on a day walk from Papatowai along the coast and then inland (and up) to our accommodation, which was an old converted bus, high up on the hill with great views. The second day we wandered back down to Papatowai.           "
28,"Last night we had a southerly change come through so we had lots of rain overnight and it cooled down considerably. One cyclist couple must have had a problem as they were drying their sleeping mats and bags out in the morning; however we were fine and dry with our new groundsheet. The weather was still cool all day but when out of the wind and with the sun out it shot up 10'C or so - but that wasn't very often.It was so cool early on that we put our leg warmers on (shock,horror!) but when we realised later on that it was better to get our legs dirty rarther than them, off they came.    The only difficulties we should have had today were:-  a) the westerly headwind, which was bad enough as it was very gusty at times and made it hard work (we were going west) b) the intermittent squally showers, heavy and cold at times, that the westerly wind sent shooting across; we got bucketfulls thrown on us and with not much warning!  c) the 35kms approx of gravel road we had to cover; the first 20+kms included sections of roadworks where they were going to tar seal it. After last night's rain it was like riding through sticky toffee at times and the bikes got caked in wet mud. We had to stop regularly to clean it off around the brakes etc. The last lot of gravel road to Slope Point was even worse as the grader machine was going up and down and churning it up into deep sand in places. d) And if all of that wasn't enough then we had Murphy's Law to put up with. The first lot of gravel started straight away and was quite hilly in places; we did get some shelter from the wind when in the bush forest areas later on so that was some relief and there were some good views, especially after the first climb from Papatowai. It was a happy time though when we hit tarmac eventually, then we only had the wind and rain to contend with. A cafe showed up at lunchtime so we fed our faces with a couple of late breakfasts; there were no shops on today's route.    So whilst we were dealing with problems a), b) & c) with about 13kms to go problem d) surfaced. We were on the sandy gravel stuff that the grader had just churned up and because it was that bad we were just about to get off and walk a section when Jo's front wheel went and she just fell gently to the ground; 99 times out of 100 there would be no problem, the ground although stoney was soft. Unfortunately she gashed her right knee quite badly (it looks like it may need stitches). I felt queasy just looking at it and of course was no help whatsoever in that condition. Disaster - what now?  Fortunately just behind us was a camper van and the kind couple stopped and provided assistance so we (that is Jo and the campervan lady) could wash and clean out the wound, apply some antiseptic (actually some disinfectant they had in their van) and put a dressing on stuck down with some elastoplast that a car coming the other way provided (we did have some of our own but you don't refuse help do you?). Now, however, no way could Jo ride her bike so the campervan couple gave her a lift with her bike to the backpackers place and I followed on just as the wind got stronger. So here we are at Slope Point Backpackers with Jo's knee stiffening up and Invercargill and the nearest hospital about 65kms away. The question now dear reader is 'What will happen tomorrow?' Will the answer be one of the following? 'Jo cycles on gamely (or is that stupidly) the 65kms to Invercargill to receive medical assistance?  'Jo's knee stiffens up too much to prevent her cycling so Dave cycles to Invercargill on is own to hire a car to come back for her' 'We stay here until Jo fully recovers and cycle on together'(that sounds a daft thing to do) 'Something else happens to get us out of this dilemma' The variables to all of these are:- There is no public transport from where we are. There are no shops, cafes or other facilities for about 15kms in any direction and we have just about run out of food. So what will happen? You will have to read the next 'exciting' instalment of this travelogue to find out.............................
"
29,"There was no waiting at the accident and emergency department; in fact they were so quiet that Jo had 6 medical staff fussing over her at one time whilst I sat in the waiting room well away from the all that gory stuff. The nurse said that a lot of the patients they get are workers from the building site next door where they are building a new hospital. So, an hour later, Jo reappeared all stitched up with a big bandage around her leg and a big limp to go with it and there was nothing to pay - that perked the Finance Director up. Another taxi took us back to the Information Centre where over a coffee and muffin we considered what our options were. The limitations being that Jo can not cycle for at least 10 days until she has had the stitches out and even then we will just have to see. The outcome of the committee meeting was:- We hire a car for 24hrs to get us back to Slope Point, stay the night there then bring our gear and bikes back to Invercargill tomorrow. Hiring a car wasn't easy, the Information lady had to try a few places and we finished up having to pay top whack, so hiring for any longer period of time for the moment was not on. We booked ourselves 2 nights at the Invercargill YHA (handily placed in he centre of town) to give us more time to get ourselves organised for the next 10 days or so.     So, looking all upmarket in our silver automatic Mitsubishi Lancer we went to the supermaket and stocked up and then went back to Slope Point and drove the final 5kms down to Slope Point headland itself; well we had to didn't we.Jo hobbled gamely down to the marker post which told us that this was the southernmost tip of the NZ's South Island. What rubbed salt slightly in the wound was that there were 2 cyclists just starting back after wheeling their bikes down to the sign but after chatting to them we weren't too dissappointed as they hadn't been to Cape Reinga. Today was friday the 13th but our bad luck started yesterday, at least today we have got some things sorted out and we know where we stand now or in one person's case, half stand.  In the evening we chatted to David & Hiedi from New Mexico who were on a lengthy trip including Europe, South Africa, Tasmania before coming here. They were riding a superb mountain/expeditiion type tandem built like a tank. Two British lads also here tonight who went to Tokanui in the evening to watch the annual speed sheep shearing competition; one of them took part. Teams of 3 with 1 winding a handle to generate power for hand held shears which another sheared the sheep with: the 3rd member had to eat a can of beans at the same time. They all then had to down a pint of beer - the fastest team wins. Pity the poor sheep though as most of the blokes weren't sheep shearers and they had had a bit to drink as well. In terms of diary entries for the next 10 days or so we will probably group some together until we start (which hopefully we will) cycling again. Watch this space..........   "
30,"A day of dismal weather, cool south westerly's, on and  off rain after a brightish start and not an ideal day to be out on our bikes but that didn't make us feel any happier particularly as we passed more cycle tourists on our way to Invercargill. We would much rarther be out on the bikes, even this sort of weather, than sat doing nothing behind the wheel of a car. Our present mood is reflected in the weather as the forecast for the next few days is not so good - where has the summer gone? Rarther than drive straight to Invercargill we first of all went down to Cape Bluff as we always intended going there on the bikes even after going to Slope Point. We didn't really have much enthusiasm though for taking pictures of ourselves by the sign showing distances to various places in the world - we left that to the 'tourists' and had a coffee instead and that wasn't very good either. Once in Invercargill we went back to the Information Centre (we are becoming regular visitors here) and organised transport for Monday to get us from here to Te Anau in Fiordland, about 170kms away and on our intended cycling route. We would get bored spending more than a couple of days in Invercargill and we do like Te Anau and its surroundings. We can't sleep in the tent as Jo would find that a problem so we tried to book other accommodation but with limited success; the Youth Hostel and also Cabins on a campsite we tried were full. We managed to get a double room in a backpackers for 2 nights only so we will have to organise something more when we get there if we want to stay longer, which we may well do. We prefer to be in nice scenic surroundings doing next to nothing than in a large town. We saw David & Heidi again briefly as they called in to the backpackers looking for accommodation - without success. We may well see them again however in the coming week as they are headed in our direction and we will probably leap frog them on the bus tomorrow. When we were re-reading this entry later on we realised that it sounds very depressing and probably a bit more depressing than we actually feel now - now that we have come to terms with the situation. However we decided not to change anything as it reflected our mood at the time. Sunday 15th Feb - it's my birthday  To be honest I am not that bothered about celebrating birthdays (mine anyway) unless they are those important ones with a zero on the end and I have got another 3 years now before one of those crops up.The weather was somewhat better today, siightly warmer and brighter with no rain but no sun until late afternoon which reflected our slightly improved outlook on life. Jo couldn't really walk far and then only slowly so we only walked across the road to the internet cafe to upload some more pics and check e:mails etc and then down the street to have a coffee. The rest of the day we spent reading and relaxing back at the backpackers place which had very good facilities for doing that sort of thing. In the evening we went out to 'celebrate' my birthday at Waxy O'Sheas the Irish theme pub down the street which was in fact nothing like an actual Irish pub. They had Irish music over the sound system which consisted of the same 3 songs played over and over again. so after an hour your feet stopped tapping to the music because you had got bored with it. The plus, though, was that they had Guinness, Murphy's and Kilkenny beer on tap so we had a jar or three and a very enjoyable time. We feel a lot happier now - but then that is probably alcohol induced and may only be temporary. We shall have to see what tomorrow  brings to confirm, or otherwise, our outlook on life.
"
31,
32,"Weatherwise it was dry, cloudy and cool in the morning but by the time we had left Invercargill behind on the bus it went downhill and got wetter and wetter. Everybody, including the locals are now complaining about this weather but at least we are not getting it as bad as they are on the lower North Island (at least not yet anyway). They had a major storm today with extensive flooding, trees and power lines down, even houses, roads and bridges swept away  - It was the major item on the evening news being the worst storm for decades. We got nothing like that down here but this weather has now got 5-7 days to behave itself now before we really start complaining as Jo's knee should be better by then and we want some warm, dry, sunny weather to cycle in and get this suntan going again; we are starting to lose it! The mini-bus was practically full with 10 of us; 2 young german cyclists as well - luggage and bikes go in a towed trailer.Then when we got to Riverton after 40kms the two American cycists we met at Slope Point were waiting to get on and we wondered how they would get their tandem on - no problem; it had couplings that allowed them to split it into two parts. They were busing it to Te Anau and then going kayaking on the fiords for a few days. When we dropped somebody off at Manapouri, 20kms before Te Anau, there were the two English cyclists we last saw at Oamaru; we managed a quick chat with them. There is an absolute load of cycle tourists about now; we saw another 9 on the road today as well. And we saw more later........and what's the betting that every single one of them is complaining about this weater now. For the moment though we are here at one of our favorite NZ places; a lovely location by the lake with the Fiordland Mountains of the Kepler and Murchison ranges as a back drop - just need some sunshine to show them off in all their glory.       "
33,"It is far easier being in a tent as all you have to do is roll up to a campsite (or pitch it just where ever you want out in the wilds) with no forward planning required at all. Yesterday Te Anau was chocablock with all accommodation types taken (apart from tents!) and it was a similar picture for the Queenstown area so we heard. When we called into the Information Centre in the morning to book our trip there were queues of people already trying to book accommodation for tonight and having a lot of trouble. Quite honestly that must be a real pain having to spend time doing that most days when you are on holiday - too much hassle and time wasted from our viewpoint. The campsite owner we spoke to said they had never experienced anything like this before - he blamed 'Lord of the Rings' for it all!  But he wasn't complaining about all of this extra business though. For the moment though this booking acommodation chore is something we have to do as well so we organised ourselves for 2 more days here and then at Queenstown, our next port of call. For a horrible moment today we thought Jo's recovery was in jeopardy because the wound wasn't looking too good so first we went to the pharmacy who sent us to the Medical Centre as they thought it might be iinfected. The doctor however just changed the dressing and said it was ok - and that will be 35 dollars please! Then Jo went to get her haircut (so she didn't look scuffier than me) So we had a bottle of wine to celebrate spending all this money. Wednesday 18th Feb - Milford Sound trip We caught a coach at 10:00hrs for our trip to and cruise on Milford Sound. It's 120kms just to get there but through some stupendous mountain and lake scenery; we had plenty of short viewing stops on the way including a BBQ lunch (in a light drizzle). Just 12 of us on the small coach; the rest had come down from Queenstown, which meant a 12hr+ day for them by the time they got back. We were hoping for some really wet weather at Milford Sound so we would get all the waterfalls streaming off the sheer cliffs; there are a couple of really good permanent waterfalls as well. We saw Milford Sound 5yrs ago in glorious sunshine so we really wanted the complete opposite today. We had some real good rain on the way there and were very hopeful but as soon as we got through Homer Tunnel and descended to the Sound it started to brighten up with hardly any rain - and this is about the wettest place in all of NZ; it gets 6 to 7 metres of rain a year. What's going on! - when we want sun we get rain and when we want rain we get sun!            It didn't really matter though; even on a second visit it still took our breath away - it's an awesome place with the sheer mountains rising a mlle and more from the water; Mitre Peak being the most shapely. We spent nearly 2hrs on the boat trip going right out to the end of the fiord and  back and then it was straight on the coach and back to Te Anau before 18:00hrs  -  just a great trip and well worth the money. You can't come to NZ and not see Milford Sound (and/or Doubtful Sound nearby) Todays useless bit of info: Milford Sound is actually a Fiord not a Sound. One is created by the space left by a retreating glacier which is then filled by the sea and the other is created by the sea filling a valley either by the valley floor falling or the sea rising - without any glacial activity. You can work out which is which yourself. Thurs 19th February - we're not going outside much in this weather! It's a good job Jo is incapacitated otherwise we would be getting really frustrated by this weather. Low, low cloud & low, low temperatures with strong winds, rain and thunder rolled in for good measure - that was today's theme. We had a heater in our cabin so that went on and before venturing outside we put all our warm clothes on and even then we only walked down the main street stopping off at an internet place, a cafe, the supermarket and the Tourist Office to book a bus to Queenstown for tomorrow. Before Jo's injury we both really wanted to cycle the gravel road through the mountains from Te Anau via Mavora Lakes and then catch the ferry across to Queenstown; total distance about 130kms (approx 100kms on gravel) - we would have taken 2 days over it camping at Mavora Lakes; the reverse of the route we did in 1999. I was planning to cycle this tomorrow (it would have to be done in one day) whilst Jo caught the bus via the main road but the forecast for tomorrow is for yet more xxxx weather with strong head winds as well,  making the route a bit impractical; there is also a river cossing involved and no shelter or facilities of any kind - it's a fine weather route really. The forecast for the weekend is pretty naff as well so we can't really sit it out here waiting for an improvement. To expend some energy in the evening we ate out at the local pizzeria with a window view of fresh snow on the mountains as the clouds cleared eventually and the rain finally stopped. "
34,"We were wondering a few days back as to whether we had moved into Autumn already, even though Autumn does not officially start until March 1st. We reached the conclusion today that we have bypassed Autumn altogether and moved straight into Winter! There are only one or two diehards wearing shorts at the moment; everybody else is wrapped up to the eyeballs. Do you know - our legs haven't seen the sun for about a week now. We had a 2hr+ coach ride to get to Queenstown by lunchtime with some very pleasant scenery on the way to keep us interested - snow on all the hill tops. We had a brief toilet stop at Garston (elevation 304metres, population 106) whose claim to fame is that it is 'NZ's most inland village' with a sign there giving the crow's distances to the 4 coasts N,S,E & W. The Cafe/Petrol place had perhaps the most unique offer available anywhere 'Free 10mins internet access with every fuel fill'     Jo went to the Medical Centre at Queenstown to see about getting her stitches out; no joy. They re-dressed it and said leave it until Monday; that will be $10 please - (cheaper because the nurse did it). We are booked into a backpackers, a 5min walk from the busy town centre. Queenstown being the 'tourist and adventure capital of the South island' is an extremely busy place (no vacancy signs up everywhere) and really not somewhere we want to stay until Monday as it is not our cup of tea - great location though by the lake. We have decided to stay tomorrow and sit out the bad weather which is forecast and then move onto quieter Wanaka; Jo is booked on a bus on Sunday to get there and I am definitely riding it otherwise I will go absolutly bananas; it's a very hilly ride so hope the weather is favourable. There are some flattish and quieter roads around Wanaka that Jo can test her knee out on Monday after the stitches are out. It will then be decision time as to what our next plans are. Weatherwise today: cold start, sunshine and cloud becoming slighty warmer but then the wind increasing through the day and by late afternoon total cloud cover and back to cold again....and those clouds look very grey indeed. Sat Feb 21st - a wet saturday in Queenstown Pouring down when we woke up, it eased off later so we went out, then we had a sunny interval (note the singular) and it got quite warm (looks promising), then it got windier, then it cooled down, then it rained again, then it eased off, then it rained again (not promising). One of those umbrella up, umbrella down, into cafe, out again, into shop(s), out again, walk by lake, seek shelter, walk again, back into shop, out again, days. Finally give up on it all and went back to accommodation for the rest of the day and read and relaxed watching the rain come down outside, then it eased off, then...........etc, etc.... If for the remainder of this trip any more Kiwi's say 'well we really needed this rain' again then they will get a smack in the mouth!
"
35,"It didn't start like that though; Jo was catching the bus at 10:30 and I left just after 09:00 with arm and leg warmers, jacket and even socks on as it was very cool. I was slightly embarrassed having to wear socks with sandals (it's surely one of the world's worst fashion statements) but no way was I exposing my toes to this chilly start. After 20kms I was at the start of the big climb of the day to get over the Crown Range, highest point 1076 metres so I stopped to have a bit to eat, a drink and removed my socks, legwarmers and jacket as this would be warm work even in these cool temperatures. It was also here that I had it confirmed to me why it is essential that I must bring Jo along with me on these tours (apart from organising clothes washing that is) I had put one of my drink bottles down and forgot to pick it back up again and didn't realise it until 2kms from the top - no way was I going back for it. If Jo had been there she would have looked after me making sure I didn't leave anything behind - including her!  So if anybody come across a red Tour de France 2000 Coca Cola bottle then ask the owner if they have been to Queenstown, NZ recently.     On the first few hairpins I spotted another cycle tourist  about 300 metres back, so, of course, this is where the male competitive spirit overules common sense. I was determined not to be overtaken, which in hindsight was a bit foolish seeing as I hadn't been on the bike for over a week and this was a tough climb with some steep sections. I was keeping the distance without over taxing myself (well, not too much) but on one of the steepish sections there was a good point to take a picture so I stopped (honestly, that's the main reason I stopped). It was a Japanese lad behind me and he stopped and we had a brief chat. I think he was welcome for a short rest as well as he may also have had that male competitive thing going, being determined to catch me; we met up again at the top. About 1km from the top there was a horn sounding behind me and a minibus went past with Jo waving from the back window. It's a good job that wasn't 10mins earlier; I would have been caught out resting (I mean taking a photograph).        In theory I should have been rewarded for all that effort with nearly 40kms of downhill and flattish riding to Wanaka but no.......I  had a headwind all of the way and had to pedal just about every last metre of it and also withstand the calm manner of half a dozen cyclists going the other way, uphill, in apparent ease couresty of the strong backwind they were getting.  I had a coffee stop at Cardrona, with it's famous old hotel, which was a stopping off point in the goldrush days as prospecters made their way via this route to the Queenstown goldfields. I was into Wanaka after13:00hrs where Jo was already established at the Mountainview Backpackers  - a recommended place. Wanaka (one of our favourite NZ places) is in a beautiful location by the lake with the snow capped mountains of the Mt Aspiring National park in the background and of course everything looks so much better when the sun is out. and doesn't life feel good then. We are not likely to leave Wanaka until Weds as there is more bad weather forecast from tomorrow lunchtime and through all day Tuesday and we also need to give Jo's knee some gentle riding around here before heading over to the West Coast. There may be a delay in getting more diary entries e:mailed as I have some doubt as to what the level of mobile coverage is on the West Coast. We may get more bad weather over there (it has a reputation for lots of rain) in which case we can sit in a internet cafe and type it in.    UPDATE 23/2  Those stitches can't come out until the end of this week so says the doctor at the Wanaka Medical centre. We now need to work out what to do.
"
36,"The next Medical Centre after Wanaka, up the West Coast, is at Hokitika or Greymouth which is, would you believe it, about 450-500kms away. We could stay here until Friday or Monday and see the doctor again (and even then he might not take the stitches out) but as much as we like Wanaka we are limited as to what we can do with Jo not being able to manage much more than level walking at the moment. The other variable is that there is some bad weather due tonight and into tomorrow and then it is supposed to turn back into something like 'summer' from late Weds onwards. So we have devised and implemented a master plan, which is............... 1) We are booked into another backpackers nearby for Tuesday night as the one we are in is fully booked. 2) We sit out the bad weather here through Tuesday  3} Jo is booked on a bus on Weds to take her to Franz Josef Glacier (about 280kms away) and is also booked into the Youth Hostel there for 2 nights. 4) I cycle to Franz Josef through Weds & Thurs and possibly into Friday as well depending on my legs and the wind direction. The scenery over to the West Coast and up to Franz Josef is superb even more so if the weather forecast turns out to be correct (you got to have hope). So Jo gets to see it from the bus and I see it somewhat slower 5) We are both booked into the Youth Hostel for Friday & Saturday. Franz Josef will provide a change of scenery and there are some short walks we could probably do there. 6) We then both catch the bus to Greymouth on Sunday and get to see a doctor first thing on Monday morning and hopefully by then get rid of these blasted stitches and get this tour back to something like normality. We shall see by next Monday whether this best laid plan comes to fruition or not. The way things have been going lately though something is bound to crop up to put a spanner in the works. Tuesday 24th Feb - bad weather, what bad weather? We have stopped believing these weather forecasts; the bad wet weather they forecast came through during the night and the only 'bad weather' we got today was the very strong winds, which would have made cycling very difficult in our planned direction so it was a good job I wasn't setting off today. After a cool start it was a nice sunny day but very bracing with the wind whipping up off the lake for our walk of 2hrs+ that we did along the lake shore - flat, so Jo had no problems. Jo also managed to ride her bike today. That shocked you didn't it so perhaps I had better elaborate - she got on her bike (without too much difficulty) and free wheeled the 200 metres down the hill to the other backpackers place we were booked into; not a pedal was turned. We had a real neat bedroom at the Matterhorn South Backpackers; it was a shed in the garden, but this was no ordinary shed - timber lined walls, carpeted, a double bed (that just fitted in), a little built-in wardrobe and storage shelves, a sink with hot water, electric lights and a heater. We loved it; it had been called (lovingly) 'The Hobbitt Hole' by some previous guests.........$50 and it's yours for the night and with very good  facilities in the main building as well, which was all of 3 strides away.    "
37,"       Where else can you start from a beautiful location like Wanaka then ride on the left hand side of one lovely large lake (Lake Hawea) backed with majestic mountains then cross over a smal col and travel on the right hand side of another lovely large lake (Lake Wanaka) backed by even more majestic mountains(snow capped); then head up a broad mountain valley (Makarora) with more snow capped mountains; enter forrested areas (The Mt Aspiring National Park); cross over the main divide of the South Island(Haast Pass at 564 metres) and then drop down to rain forest, wide glacial rivers, waterfalls everywhere and with even higher mountains (with glaciers and even more snow) as a backdrop and then finish by the remote and desolate West Coast.           Words are not strong enough; awesome comes nowhere close and even pictures only tell half the story. All cyclists coming to NZ must not miss out of this route - it's numero uno! Take your time and do it in 2 days with a stop at Makarora, about halfway. I was on a mission so couldn't afford that luxury. Today I saw 10 cycle tourists going in one direction or the other and about another 15 in two separate supported rides and then there were another 5 (2 Canadians, 2 Brits and 1 Austrian) at Haast who had ridden from Makarora  today. The 2 Brits had even sat in Wanaka for nearly a week waiting for good weather to ride it in.  We first did this route in 1999 on an even better day than today (no headwind). Even second time around it's quality has not diminished one iota. I've nothing more to say on the matter otherwise I'll just rabbit on and on about the route. Some other news: The Austrian lad was having some real problems with his rear wheel; broken spokes and then when replaced we couldn't true the wheel up properly because of seized nipples. For answer to this problem see tomorrow's entry. How to recycle a wheel: The Canadians had acquired a front wheel today, couresty of a car driver who had found it; the rim was ruined. However some of the spokes were used to help the Austrian; some other good spokes and the hub were kept by the Canadians. They had no use for the tyre or inner tube (wrong size for them) so they were passed to me. Everybody wins! Jo's story:- The bus trip was an uneventful 5.5hr journey and along with me there were 5 other cyclists, some going to Fox Glacier and the rest to Franz Josef. I had a genuine reason not to be cycling but they were missing out on some of the best cycling on the South Island. Sure it's a hilly route but I've ridden it before and I am in my fifties; why weren't they riding in geat weather like this? We passed Dave alongside Lake Hawea and I got a wave from him. The Youth Hostel at Franz Josef was a lovely place and I got chatting to quite a few interesting people; the time flew by. I got lots of assistance travelling on my own; a young lad getting my bike off the bus and putting the wheel in; a young man at the hostel reception taking my bike round to the bike shed and then carrying my bags to the dormitory; I was standing at the patio entrance wondering which table to sit at and a young man offered to put one of the umbrella's up for me. This is all fantastic but what concerns me is that I don't know if it is because of my injured knee and they have sympathy for me or that they all might be missing their mothers. I think it's a motherly thing because I was allocated by misake a bed in a 4 bed dormitory for the first night and I was sharing it with 3 young lads. The French lad at reception had mistaken the booking as it was made out for Jose, my full name. Anyway, the lads were all as good as gold and looked after me and kept the room very tidy and went to bed without any fuss! I moved to a female dorm the next morning.
"
38,"     A total change scenically from yesterday (weatherwise just as good) and nearly as enjoyable; it was coastline, rain forest, mountains on my right hand side all the way and just a glimpse of snow on the tops from time to time - I don't need glasses to look at the scenery! Only a few steep hills and they came in the first 30kms which was a good job as I had some aching legs today after yesterday's ride so was glad of some gentle riding. The answer to the Austrian's wheel problem was: He disabled the rear brake so the wheel would run without catching; he phones the bike shop in Hokitika (250kms away) but they couldn't provide a a 700c wheel so he finishes up phoning Christchurch (about 500+kms away) and they could. He rides 123kms to Fox Glacier with a front brake only; said it was 'fun' going down the few steep hills - the new wheel is scheduled to arrive at Fox Glacier by bus tomrrow afternoon. Problem sorted!        I phoned the Franz Josef Youth Hostel and left a message to tell Jo that I will be there tomorrow morning for coffee at 11:00hrs - but I didn't tell her about the glasses. In the evening I walked into town to get something for tea; went into the small supermarket but nothing took my fancy so I wandered into the pub (as you do without thinking sometimes) and thought I may get something in there. It was very busy so I had a beer to wait a bit; it was still busy 15mins later so I had another one. Now I had just about spent my dinner budget so I went back into the supermarket bought a yoghurt, a banana and a packet of crisps and went back to the campsite kitchen and ate it all with the last of my bread and cheese and chatted with the others; far more enjoyable than spending mega bucks on a pub meal. Do you think all of that is good fuel for tomorrow though ? - I am not so sure.   "
39,"   Said my goodbyes to the others and I was off just after 09:30hrs for the 25kms to Franz Josef where I had an appointment with a certain lady for coffee at 11:00hrs. Some nice easy recovery cycling I had thought but I had forgotten how hilly this section is - straight from Fox it climbs to get over Cook Saddle then it descends before climbing again to get over Omoeroa Saddle, both longish climbs - this was no easy recovery ride! Especially so as I had to push on in the last 5kms to try and get there for 11:00hrs; I failed by 2 mins and I have to say I was a bit lathered when I arrived - I hate being late for appointments;  it's just shows a certain lack of respect don't you think. The rest of the day was Jo telling me all that had been going on and me trying to keep alert and show an interest; I don't think I impressed her but then I don't think she fully realises that I am a tad tired after the past 3 days. It's definitely far easier for me being in a twosome cycle touring setup as it stops me from thrashing myself silly.  The good news: There is no doctor in Franz Josef (however one visits every monday if you are prepared to wait untl then) but there is a district nurse so Jo went off there just to see about getting the dressing changed and came back with the stitches out and a new dressing. I hope she doesn't want to go cyclng tomorrow; I may need some more rest. I was laid down this afternoon trying to do just that and the fire alarm went off so we all had troop outside; it was a false alarm. Jo going to the nurse and getting her stitches out unexpectedly has thrown the Tour Leader's plans into disarray. Previously we had a booked a bus on Sunday to take us to Greymouth and also booked some accommodation there; Greymouth was where we initially intended getting the stitches out. After a brief committee meeting we have decided to stick with these travel plans and start our cycling again from Greymouth.  Question: Do you know what the problem is with having fine weather at Fox & Franz Josef Glaciers? Answer: It's the constant noise from dawn to dusk of helicopters and light aircraft flying with tourists to and from Mt Cook & the glaciers as they take every opportunity to make some bucks before the next batch of bad weather arrives, which it tends to do with alarming regularity here on the wet & wild West Coast.   Saturday 28th Feb - no helicopters today Good job that we planned today as a go nowhere day as we got some real heavy downpours at times (the weather forecast was spot on) We wandered down to the cafe and shops (twice) and that just about sums up today. How to get a doctor's appointment at Franz Josef: There is a piece of paper with a list of times (for a Monday only of course) outside the community hall. You pick your time and write your name down next to it. As of today nobody had put their name down; must be a healthy lot around here. Apart from the tourists that is; the district nurse said her busiest time is late afternoon when the groups come back down from glacier walking - a twisted knee here, a sprained ankle there, here a bruise, there a cut, everywhere a ........................    The Youth Hostel has a stock of umbrellas in the entrance for you to use; that shows just how much it can rain around here. We were sat in the lounge area and there was a girl walking up the street to the hostel in the pouring rain, dragging one of those umbrellas behind her; all  twisted and bent. She must have encountered one of the gusty winds we have been getting; she has got some explaining to do to the hostel staff. 'Well, it was like this, you see.................... And talking about the rain: The rain today was like taking a variable shower; most of the time it was on a gentle level 2 or 3 but then without warning we would get a short burst (5 to 15mins) on a level 9 or 10 as though somebody had suddenly yanked the shower lever right round to the top. That was ok when we were indoors looking out and saying glad we are not outside in that. The big risk when outside was you could start, to say, cross the road and before you got to the other side you would get a level 9 or 10 thrown down on you. Believe us; an umbrella in that situation is of no use whatsoever - you get wet from the ground up!
"
40,"A lazy day doing nothing much in the morning, apart from a short bush walk, a coffee, a visit to the Information Centre and also to the Internet place. It was raining again (now there's a suprise), heavy at times - it was that turning on and off of the shower once more. We had thought about going up to see the glacier and considered the following options:- 1: Walk there and back(that's about 10kms)    Conclusion: a daft idea in this weather 2: Ride there and back     Conclusion: crazy idea as it's on a gravel road which will be wet and    slippy and it's far too soon for Jo 3: Get a shuttle bus which costs $10 each return    Conclusion: the craziest idea of them all as that involves expenditure. Overall conclusion: Why bother as we have seen it before in 1999 in better weather than this. A far better idea would be in to sit in the Youth Hostel lounge, read our books, have some lunch, have a cup of tea, be nice and warm and dry and wait for our bus, due at 15:00hrs. Which is exactly what we did. As well as us on the Atomic Shuttle Bus there were already 4 other bikes on going up to Greymouth, including a Belgian couple with young twins. We did see some brief brightness on the 2.5hr journey but when we arrived there Greymouth was decidingly grey and wet and down in the mouth so we were glad that we had rung ahead and booked a cabin at the Caravan Park - a tent was not so appealing in this sort of weather; particularly our tent with it's iffy floor.    Luckily the supermarket was only a short walk away so we were able to get something for tea and also a bottle of wine to celebrate.....................???? Monday 1st March - First day of Autumn & first day for a while that Jo gets out on her bike. The first day of Autumn and it's still raining but only off and on for the morning and nothing heavy. Then, by early afternoon we got some blue skies and it was nice and warm (only just though) with just a light breeze - and about time too! Some heavy rain returned in the evening just to confirm what the weather people said on the news:- 'this has been the wettest and windiest February since records began 150 years ago' However, all is not lost as it looks like warm, sunny weather from late tomorrow for a few days at least  We got out on the bikes and did 40kms after lunch up the valley and back to test Jo's knee out; there was no reaction and that included going up a couple of hills which is all good news. The only thing now is to get back 2+ weeks of lost fitness; we shall be taking it relatively easy over the next few days. Important expenditure made today:- We went to The Warehouse in town (remember?.....'where everbody gets a bargain') and I got myself another pair of reading glasses. Inflation had taken hold since my last pair and I had to pay $10 and another $5 for a case. On that cost basis this pair will have to last me 5 years if they are to be of  the same value as the last pair - there's absolutely no chance of that happening.      Conversation overheard by Jo in campsite kitchen: Old Chinese Man: 'Hello, where you from?' Other Old Oriental Man: 'Viet-Nam' Old Chinese Man: 'Ah, Viet-Nam................'How you get here?' ...... Pause Other Old Oriental Man: 'By Plane' "
41,"1 - If it was an earthquake then being outside was really no safer than being in his van. 2 - I'm the only one stood outside in the pouring rain. That story was going the rounds at breakfast time - poor guy.    The rain had stopped by early morning and we awoke to some bright skies and with a dry day forecast and a southerly wind (we were going north) things were looking up. We weren't going far today so we had a lazy start and didn't leave Greymouth itself until after 11:00hrs.      This section of the West Coast from Greymouth towards Westport is very picturesque as the road runs for a lot of the way between the bush forested hills on one side and  the sea on the other with the waves crashing onto the shore. The road dips and rises quite a bit but that provided some excellent viewpoints. We were stopping at regular intervals just to; admire the view, take a picture or two and make sure Jo's knee was ok and she wasn't over doing it - no problems there at all.     Punakaiki is more commonly know as 'Pancake Rocks'; it's a small hamlet with various accommodation types, including a campsite by the beach where we were staying; a Visitor's Centre and cafes which all serve the local attraction of the Rocks. I am sure they have got some fanciful geological history but essentially they are some unique stratified limestone rocks which look like pancakes piled on top  of each other (using your imagination of course). The big attraction though are the blowholes which at high tide with a south westerly wind blowing can be quite impressive - well, they were on our visit in1999. On the campsite with us was a local rural school outing; the whole school, all 50 kids (ages from 5 to11yrs), 3 teachers and 22 parents just having a few days away together - they were having a great time; something that you couldn't quite get with a larger school. Unfortunately their school is under threat as part of a nationwide education reform that's going on at the moment which will ultimately result in the closure of a lot of the smaller, rural schools - a shame.       High tide was at 20:20hrs so we walked back up to Pancake Rocks to see if the blowhole was showing off; it was but only a little bit, the wind needed to be stronger and in a slightly different direction so it could whip the waves up. The evening light was good though and the rocks area and coastline was quite photogenic.It was dark by 20:30hrs so rather than go straight back to the campsite we diverted via the local pub and had a couple of jugs of Monteith's Black (brewed in Greymouth and an  excellent drop) - went down a treat. There is no shop in Punakaiki, the cafe has some basic foodstuffs but if you want some milk after the cafe has closed for the day then the pub is your answer. Somebody did just that whilst we were there. 'Jug of Monteith's Black and a litre of low fat milk please' 'Do you want a glass for the milk or is it to takeaway?' Geological update: According to the signs at the Rocks the scientific boffins are at a bit of a loss as to exactly how these limestone rocks formed. The only thing they seem to agree on is that there was a secondary process involved called 'stylobedding'  - and we thought that was a mattress making company. So now you know."
42,"     We left late again, about 10:00hrs and took our time initially as we were stopping regularly whilst we were alongside the sea. Eventually we had to climb away inland, say our goodbyes to the West Coast, and tackle the ups and downs to Charleston for a lunch stop - the only facilities on the way to Westport. There were a few more bumps before things levelled out for the last 10kms or so into Westport and by the afternoon, out of the breeze the sun was lovely and warm; people sat outside their vans and and cabins soaking it up. It's not been like this since January! Quite a number of other cyclists on the campground by the end of the day; an American couple from Oregon, a French couple on recumbents, towing 2 Rann Trailers with 2 small children - with a sign saying they were on a World Tour and one other solo guy who we saw arrive but never saw again. "
43,"We were lazy getting up and slow to get away, taking our time over breakfast; talking to other people; going to the internet place and the supermarket in town etc. As this tour has gone on we have slowly changed from getting up and off on the road early, regularly between 08:00 and 08:30hrs to the situation now that we are in no rush whatsoever. Think it's the fact that the tour is coming to an end; the main aim has been accomplished (well, it was nearly); we have got time on our hands (& legs) and Jo's injury has generally taken the impetus out of the need to be anywhere by a set date - other than Auckland for our flight home on the 29th March. We could well find ourselves now doing more short days; spending a few days in one place; doing some walking or doing nothing in particular, all weather dependant of course but surely March can't be as bad as February was. It's got off to a good start so let's hope that's a good sign. Today was a picturesque ride up the lower Buller valley; wide river, wooded hillsides and no steep hills. The only facilities on route was the small historic Berlins Hotel where we stopped for a coffee and pie. The Pedaltours cycling company were setup for their lunch in the garden awaiting their riders who were scattered down the road; some would be finishing lunch before others had arrived.    We were at the small store at Inangahua Junction by 13:00hrs and over a cup of tea contemplated what to do. Murchison was a bumpy 50+kms further on and the only facilities before there was a basic DOC campsite about 25kms away. There was a backpackers down the lane so we wandered down there and straight away decided to stay. A beaut little spot, very quiet and tents allowed in the garden so before too long we were well established and resting the afternoon away - Inwoods Farm Backpackers is the place - it comes with a recommendation. The only issue we had was what to have for tea. We had practically nothing with us apart from bread, peanut butter, some ham and tea bags; we were a bit lacking in forward planning today - we really are getting lazy and need to buck our ideas up or else this tour will completely fall apart. The store was basic, very basic with very limited foodstuffs - you could get takeaways; get some booze; hire a video (you could make an evening out of those 3 things). The big problem though was the shop shut at 17:00hrs so a takeaway was not an option. We came out with 6 eggs, a couple of potatoes, an onion and a tin of fruit........and seeing as it was quite hot outside a couple of icecreams to eat now. So for tea it was omelette(pots, ham and onion) on toast with sliced peaches for afters and breakfast looks like it's more toast with the peanut butter. Will that breakfast be enough to get us to Murchison and possibly beyond or will we have to call in at the store before setting off and scrounge up something else? - a takeaway perhaps. Read tomorrow's 'exciting' episode to see what unfolds........... A young Dutch cycling couple (Guert & Marilee) turned up who we last saw at Papatowai on the South Coast 2 days before Jo's accident. We had a good chat in the evening on all things cycling.   "
44,"We couldn't see a thing when we first popped our heads outside of the tent; the mist was down to our ankles. Ruth, the owner said they normally get this sort of weather (cool nights and very damp, misty and cool early mornings) in April - we have said before; this is crazy weather we are having. She said it would clear to be a lovely sunny day by 10:00hrs; out by 30mins - it was 10:30hrs and then it got increasingly warm and was quite hot by early afternoon before a breeze sprung up later and cooled things down a notch.
   It was another slow getaway, Guert & Marilee were even lazier than us getting off - it was 10:00hrs when we left and we didn't see them again until Murchison. We decided to stoke up with a pie and a cup of tea at the store before heading off; a bit of a mistake as the pie was a bit naff - don't think that store will be getting our custom again. The four slices of toast and peanut butter we had for breakfast stood us for the ride though and we didn't eat again until Murchison where a large muffin each, with a coffee, kept us going until tea time. Scenically it was largely a repeat of yesterday as we moved from the Lower Buller Valley to the Upper Buller Valley which translates into hillier than yesterday but nothing too drastic to give us any pain. The Upper Buller is a popular white water rafting and kayaking area; we saw lots of kayaks on top of cars but nothing in the water.    We thought 4 months was a long time to be touring NZ but spare a thought for a certain Mr Brunner and 3 Maori Guides who in1847 travelled, or rather explored, a route from Nelson down the Buller Valley and then down the West Coast to Paringa (above Haast) and then all the way back again in 550 days; wonder if they kept a travelogue going. There was a plaque by the roadside that told us all this.  We were in Murchison by early afternoon, put the tent up, had our shower, did our washing, had a rest, had a coffee, did some shopping - all those familiar daily cycle touring chores. The campsite was quite busy and the kitchen area was quite small so we decided to eat out and wandered back into town later on for some food and a jug of Monteith's Black - fast becoming our favourite tipple. We first visited Murchison in 1999 and the town then was quite a dead, slightly rundown place and the campsite was only a very small place. Five years on the campsite has grown to 3 times the size and the centre of town tonight (it's only a small place) was busy, busy with people sitting outside the 2 main pubs on quite a pleasant warm evening; lots of cars with kayaks on the roofs (there was a kayaking competition on today and probably all weekend). "
45,"  It was easy riding as we went even further up the Buller Valley, more pastoral than the previous 2 days (but still the forrested hillsides). By the end of the day we would be practically at the source of the Buller River. We stopped for a pot of tea and a pie (a Mrs Mac's pie - scrummy) at Owen's Tavern after an hour; the only facilities on route today. This area is big on fishing and hunting; there were some pictures here of hunters and the wild boars they had shot, including a boar's head on the wall. From the pictures it appears  that the customary way to show off your prize is to hold it on your back by the legs with it's head behind yours (as though you were carrying a rucksack) - strange behaviour. Later in the day a van came out from a side gravel road with 2 dead wild boar on the back. We pass no judgement here on hunting animals; we are just giving you the facts on what we see. What did give us some grief today, after Owens Tavern, were the amount of bees about. Trying to put some sun cream on at the tavern was a pain as the bees were buzzing round us - inquisitive rarther than menacing. Further on at Kawatiri Juncion where we chatted to a Kiwi cyclist they were just as bad. He was contemplating how much further to go on (he was headed in the opposite direction to us) and the wind had recently sprung up and he had to pedal down his last hill. We thought we were really fit as we were flying along, not realising how much the wind was pushing us. The last 25kms from here to St Arnaud was a lot quieter; the valley a lot wider and we had the mountains of the Nelson Lakes region as a backdrop and also our intended destination. St Arnaud is a small pleasant place in a lovely location at the bottom of Lake Rotoiti with the mountains behind, though you can't see the lake from the village but there's no problem seeing the mountains! We are planning to stay here for at least a couple of days and do some walking - the forecast is good (heard that one before).    Weatherwise today it was the standard cool start with some high cloud about that broke up before lunchtime to give us a practically total blue sky day. It took a few hours to warm up but we think the temperature may have broken the magic 20'C barrier as we were drinking quite a bit of water and we did actually sweat a bit; but then we did have the wind at our backs - not cooling our faces down. Sunday 7th March - day off for some walking We went walking for a change today, nothing too strenuous, like up the mountains, just a few hours alongside the lake and on a couple of the waymarked tracks as much as anything to get our walking muscles going. It's quite different (and difficult at times) doing other forms of exercise after being on the bike for sometime. We like walking as well as cycling but sometimes trying to combine the two can be a bit painful on the muscles the first time out. We took it all very steady today.  It was a busy time down by the lake as there was a weekend sailing regatta on the go. All mixture of boats, particularly the older types. Small yachts, outboards, rowing boats, some wooden boats, a couple of steam driven boats; there was quite a crowd and they were supported by a variety of outside catering tents so we had no problem getting something to eat and drink and also we could sit outside in the warm weather and even under an umbrella to keep the sun off.    We also made some plans about going off for a couple of days up into the mountains with a night spent at one of the trampers huts; the weather looks reasonable for the next couple of days. We will hire one large rucksack ($8 a day) from the Youth Hostel where we are staying and leave our bikes and other gear there until we return; the hut costs us $10 each. "
46,"The Finance Director was particularly upset as we had expended $20 on hut tickets and about another $20 on some dehydrated food. He soon calmed down however when he realised that the hut tickets can be used elsewhere and the food will keep for another trip; he will just have to carry the stuff in the meantime. There was another English cycling couple at the Youth Hostel who had set off before us and then returned 30mins later; he had a broken spoke, in his rear wheel, on the block side and they had no spare spokes or block remover.We couldn't really help as neither our spare spokes or block remover were compatible. Unfortunately they were headed in the wrong direction for bike shops; the next time we saw them they and their bikes were on the Atomic Shuttle service (that cyclists good samaritan) headed back the way they had come yesterday - to the Motueka/Nelson area; and hopefully a helpful bike mechanic.  After all of this it was once again after 10:00hrs when we left onto some nice quiet roads and with a quiet weather day as well, just pleasantly warm but no blue sky - so no real views or anything photogenic; apart from, that is, the moving house. We were descending through the Golden Downs Forest when a man in a van appeared coming up in the middle of the road with flashing lights and a sign on his roof saying 'House on the Move'; he stuck his hand out of the window with a sign saying 'Stop' - so we slowed down as there was nothing in sight behind him; then about 3 mins later another van with flashing lights appeared, closely followed by a flatbed truck with a wooden house on the back, taking up the whole width of the road and a bit more besides as it was knocking leaves off the trees - we dived onto the grass verge as the house went past. That's a first for us - never seen the like of that before.    We stopped at Kohatu Junction for a bit of lunch on a bench before going inside the Cafe/Tavern there for a pot of tea. There was a large group of Motorbikers there who were on a tour of the South Island; it had taken them a week to do what has taken us nearly 2 months. It was only 13:30hrs when we got to Tapawera and we did consider going on another 50kms to Motueka but 2 things stopped us doing that. 1 - We had some clothes washing to do but more importantly...... 2 - We have been to NZ 3 times before and each time we have stopped at this great little campground at Tapawera, so we can't really not stop again - can we? What's so special about the campground we hear you ask; well, we'll tell you....... It's small, quiet and has friendly owners It has a fully equipped kitchen with all the cooking and eating utensils you need - no need to use our own at all It has a very pleasant covered outside eating area Its got lots of little extras such as: Free herbs; free milkshakes; some free food including veggies from their garden - we got some runner beans given You can buy home made bread from them It's just a little gem of a place and we had it all to ourselves; it's not in a popular holiday area so it never gets really busy. "
47,"A short spin of the legs today from10:00hrs to lunchtime and with only one hill after 8kms (but that was a bit of a stinker) to slow us down. Afraid there's nothing much more we can tell you; the weather was a mixture of sunshine & cloud, quite warm at times; there was little wind; the scenery was a mixture of forested hills and farmland with kiwi's, apples, plums, blueberries and hops being the growing things we actually saw from the road - there was some hops harvesting going on. We didn't see any houses on the move today - how disappointing. There were no facilities on route, the road was quiet, so we kept going to Motueka (didn't take any pictures) and had a bit to eat and a coffee there before heading off to the nearby campground. There was quite a lot of traffic in Motueka, the busiest place by far since Queenstown and that seems like a long time ago. Later on we wandered back into the town, uploaded some pics to the website to bring us up to date, did the necessary supermarket shop and that was a joy; (didn't think I would ever say that) actually having a wide choice of fruit and veggies and some good value wine as well - so we had to have a bottle didn't we. We are definitely stopping in this area for a few days and (weather permitting) planning to do a few days walking in the nearby Abel Tasman National Park. Ulli (may not have spelt that right) the Austrian (with the wheel problem) who I last saw at Fox Glacier (do you remember that) turned up at the campsite. The wheel arrived by bus at Fox Glacier from Christchurch as promised and he hasn't had any further problems since; we swopped stories about our separate journies getting here - both parties being slightly euphoric about the recent good weather after the naff stuff we had in February.. We had a lovely warm sunny evening to end the day and were able to sit outside the campsite kitchen (in shorts and teeshirts) eating our tea and then relaxing and getting rid of that bottle of wine. Weds 10th March - getting ready for some tramping Some lovely warm to hot sunny weather (but cloudy and cooler by evening) to do nothing very much apart from just lazing around and organising ourselves to do some tramping over the next 4 days in the nearby Abel Tasman National Park. Part 1 of the organisation involved a visit to the Information Centre where we got: 1 - Tickets to allow us to pitch our tent for 3 nights; there are numerous basic campsites(water and toilets only) in some great locations by the sea. We could use the huts but they are more expensive and with the track being so popular they tend to be very crowded; it's far better to carry the extra weight of a tent on this track and get your own space. The Abel Tasman Track is by far the busiest one in NZ. 2 - Bus tickets to get us from Motueka, there and back; we will be getting picked up for the return at Sunday lunchtime from the far end of the track. 3 - Water Taxi tickets to take us to Torrent Bay which saves us a 4-5hr walk on the first section that we have done before. It will also make it easier to do a section further up that we haven't done yet. Part 2 of the organisation involved a trip to the outdoors shop where we hired a large rucksack for the trip; our 2 small packs would not be sufficient as apart from the tent we have to carry all our cooking stuff, food etc. Part 3 of the organisation involved a trip to the supermarket to get some more camping food to supplement the stuff we bought for the aborted trip at St Arnaud. Part 4 of the organisation involved us having to compile a list to make sure we took everything we needed as there ain't no shops out there! Part 5 of the organisation involved having a long rest to get over Parts1-4. The Finance Director needed more rest to get over making a big hole in the budget but he recovered quickly upon realising that once we set off he probably wouldn't have to open his wallet again until Sunday afternoon. The weather forecast on the evening TV 'promised' good weather for the next few days..................... "
48,"A lovely warm sunny day for the start of our tramping trip. The bikes went into the campsite garage and we went down to the end of the street to pick up the bus at 09:30hrs which actually turned out to be about 09:50hrs before we got fully away from Motueka as first the bus was late and then 5kms down the road the driver got a phone call; he had left a passenger back in Motueka so back we went. No problem for us as our boat wasn't until 10:30hrs and when we got to Kaiterteri we found the boat would be 20mins late; still no problem, we were well and truly chilled out and there was a cafe by the beach so in we went for our morning coffee. A very pleasant 30mins boat ride on a calm sea around the headlands & bays and into the National Park for our drop off at Torrent Bay. We spent the next 4hrs on the Abel Tasman coastal track; up, down and around headlands; down to golden sandy bays; through forests of Manuka and Kanuaka trees; across a long swingbridge - and all on a well graded and firm path. Lots of people about, mainly doing day walks using the water taxis to get into and out of the park (there are no roads to this area).      We stopped halfway at Bark Bay for a late lunch; benchs, flush toilets and filtered water available here; there is also a campsite and hut here as well but we continued over the hill to the beautiful, almost tropical beach at Onetahuti Bay and it's camp area just set back from the beach. No showers so we had a dip in the sea to refresh ourselves. A beautiful location but nowhere is perfect as we had to contend with those darn sandflies as the evening approached. The answer to which is long trousers tucked into your socks and long sleeves buttoned down;even then they can still be a nuisance. Forget all those patented portions from the Chemists and Outdoor shops though; the trampers answer passed down through word of mouth is a solution of 50% Dettol and 50% Baby Oil; keeps those sandflies at bay and makes your skin feel oh, so lovely

  We shared the campsite with 2 German guys, 1 Dutch guy and a French couple; everybody inside their tent by 20:30hrs when it got dark. A cool night with the only noise being the lapping of the waves and the boisterous possums when they came out to play. Some previous campers had left some rubbish in a bag (naughty, naughty) and one of the possums found it and then we think it must either have got it's head stuck in a tin can or else they were playing a game of 'kick the can' because there was an almighty racket with the can banging on the concrete floor of the cooking area; made for an interesting night. Friday 12th March -ruled by the tides Another beautiful warm to hot sunny day. We were up and away just after 09:00hrs as we had a small river estuary to cross and these have to be done around low tide; this first one at the end of Onetahuti beach was small and we had about 4hrs either side of low tide to do it but the next one at Awaroa (about 2-3hrs away) is much wider and the crossing time is much more critical if you want to avoid carrying your rucksack over your head - low tide today was 07:33hrs. So we weren't going to rush to try and cross the second one and why should we on a lovely day like this.
   This is a very civilised tramping track and to be quite honest it's not real wilderness tramping as we know it Jim; more of a stroll and what made it more civilised today was the Awaroa Lodge & Cafe which we, of course, diverted to for our morning coffee - along with just about everybody else. The other thing about this walk is if you get tired and want to get out then you just sit by one of the bays and wait for a water taxi to turn up. We sat by the beach at Awaroa Lodge watching the taxi's coming and going, dropping people off and taking others on board. For a while the beach was very quiet with only about 6 of us then 15mins later it was a hive of activity with 4 water taxis and 1 large boat turning up.      Because of the high tide (we have just had a full moon and they were particularly high) we had to retrace some of our route from the Lodge and do 1.5hrs walking around another small estuary instead of 30mins direct and even then we had to wade some of the final section to get to the campsite by the DOC Awaroa Hut and another fantastic location. No swimming in the sea today (or rarther the estuary) as there was an outside cold shower and very refreshing it was too. During the evening we watched various people crossing the estuary; the earliest trying nearly 3hrs before low tide but they were well above their waist; it was far easier  from about 1.5hrs before low tide. We will be up and off across by 08:00hrs tomorrow (low tide is 08:20hrs). "
49,"A couple of degrees cooler than yesterday with some high cloud about but just about ideal for walking in. Most people were getting ready around 08:00hrs for the estuary crossing and we were off shortly after for the 15mins walk to the other side with the water only coming up to our ankles in places. It was another 1.5hrs from here along a pleasant bush track and a beach walk along Goat Bay to Totaranui, the last place that water taxis come to in the Park; it also has gravel road access; buses call here and there is a large DOC campground here as well - quite a busy place, that is in comparison to some other parts of the Park. We could refill our water bottles here but get nothing else; no ice creams, coffees or any food; also the Visitor Centre was shut. At least we could deposit our rubbish that we had been carrying - the golden rule of tramping 'leave nothing behind but your footprints and take nothing but photgraphs'      A lot of people finish the walk here and get a water taxi or bus back; we were thinking about doing that initially but we had enough spare food with us to continue; the weather was looking fine for tomorrow and we were enjoying it so why not walk to the very end of the track - why not indeed, so we carried on. A lot less people walt this northern section of the track yet it is just as beautiful as any of the other parts and perhaps even more so because there are less people. More golden sandy beaches to walk on, bush forest to walk through and views to die for. We went via the longer route to Separation Point where there were a group of juvenile seals playing around in the small inlet below the cliffs with 2 adults keeping a close eye on them; they weren't allowed to venture too far out.      Our campsite for the final night was a 5mins walk from the beach by the Whaiwharangi Hut; only 6 of us camping; us + 2 American girls and a German couple and only 5 people staying in the hut which can sleep 20. When the campsite lost the sun early on we all trooped down to the beach to get the last of the rays. We also went into the hut later to chat to the people there and also it should be said, to stand in front of the wood burning stove; it was quite a cool evening and the hut was very cosy. We were in bed late - it must have been all of 09:30hrs!  Sunday 14th March - back to coffee, fruit and veggies Always, when we have been on one of these multi-day tramps, towards the end of one we start to get a craving for thing(s) we haven't been able to get whilst away from 'civilisation'. By 12:00hrs when we were getting on the bus to get back to Motueka we were looking forward to: a decent cup of coffee and some real fruit and veggies - no more of those packet, dehydrated, dried or powdered varieties of this and that that we have been consuming these past 3 days; the 2 American girls were craving Pizza's. I suddenly got a craving for a Mrs Mac's meat pie so when the bus stopped for 10mins at Takaka I nipped into the dairy to satisfy it.     Earlier we had only needed to walk 1.5hrs from Whariwharangi to get to the road end for the bus so we all had a nice lazy start waiting for the sun to hit the tents; a beautiful sunny day beckoned and it stayed like that all day.  By 14:00hrs we were back at the campsite, retrieved our bikes from the garage and booked into a cabin for 2 nights; a pleasant change from 10 consecutive nights in the tent. It also enabled us to get re-organised more easily; all the clothes from the tramping trip get thrown in one pile on the floor (wash day is tomorrow); our bodies get thrown under a hot shower and my face sees a razor for the first time in 3 days. We then march into town for that eagerly awaited coffee and then into the supermarket to drool over fruit and veggies and, of course, some wine.
"
50,"We worked things out over coffee and then went to the Internet place before crossing the road to the Information Centre and after that a phone box. Between these three places we managed to sort out the following: 1 - From the Internet we found out about a car hire company in Wellington that is doing special deals on one way hire to Auckland. You get a car FREE provided you only take 48hrs to do the trip (it's about 6-700kms); the only extras being your petrol costs and any insurance excess you wish to pay (about $18 a day). We think the reason they are free is that they want cars returning to Auckland as a lot of people hire cars there, tour the North Island and then leave them at Wellington before catching the ferry to the South Island and then re-hiring there - saves on car ferry costs. We booked a car for Thurs 25th; what type of car we get is anybodies guess - just hope we can fit the bikes inside! 2 - At the Information Centre we booked a bus with our good friends the Atomic Shuttle Bus Company to take us to Havelock tomorrow (about 150kms away). We are taking the bus because we don't want to ride the busy roads from here to and beyond Nelson (we rode this way in 1999) and this also enables us to get to Picton earlier where we are thinking about walking the Queen Charlotte Track on the Malborough Sounds for 3 days.  3 - Went to the phone box and booked accommodation at Havelock YHA and also at Picton for the night after; we are going to cycle from Havelock to Picton (about 40kms) along the scenic Queen Charlotte road. We are now tending to sleep indoors because (a) the nights are quite cool at the moment and our bags are only lightweight summer ones and (b) our tent flysheet has got a rip in it; we thought it had been cut but on closer inspection it appears the fabric is perishing after just too much exposure to the sun's rays would you believe - the colour has changed from an initial very dark green to a very insipid pale, pale green. This is the tent we bought in Dec 2002, whilst in Australia replacing a previously worn out tent. Warning:  the Southern Hemisphere sun can seriously damage your tent fabric.  After all of that excitement and some lunch we did very little else for the rest of the day apart from starting to read 2 of the 3 books we bought in a sale (3 for $18); that brings our reading on this trip to over 20 books; we have both read the same books. Tuesday 16th  March - bus not cycle A mixture today of sunshine and cloud, still warm enough for shorts and tee shirts - just. We had another of those lazy mornings doing nothing very much; phoned home, uploaded some pics onto the website, had our coffee and wandered back to the campsite for some lunch - we are well and truly winding down now. We caught the Atomic Shuttle bus about 14:00hrs for the 2.5hrs trip to Havelock and the Youth Hostel there. It was a lot cloudier over this side and there had been some  recent rain on the way, in the hills. Todays most interesting fact: The Havelock Youth Hostel (an old school) is called the Ernest Rutherford Hostel because this guy had his early education here before going on eventually to become a famous scientist and get a Nobel prize for being one of the first to split the atom.The building has retained a lot of it's old features, particularly inside, and it comes complete with creaking floorboards and a blackboard that you can write whatever you want on - without teacher telling you off. There were 3 cycling couples staying there : us and a French Canadian couple coming to the end of our trips and a young German couple just a day into their tour of the South Island.
"
51,"The day did brighten up briefly when Jo spotted a 'Mrs Mac's Meat Pie' sign outside the store at Linkwater and demanded one; on the basis that it may be her last opportunity. Mrs Mac's pies are definitely a cut above all the other brands though as I am writing this my memory does go back that 'Len's Steak & Oyster Pie' that I had at Te Kao on the North Island on our way to Cape Reinga; that was pretty darn good as well and certainly a rival to Mrs Mac.      We were at Picton by lunchtime and first off we went to the Tourist Office to book water transport and accommodation for 2 nights for the Queen Charlotte Track as we are off to walk it from Friday until Sunday. The weather forecast is not too clever for tomorrow so we decided to delay our start until Friday. That will then give us Monday to get our clothes washed and ourselves rested and sorted out before catching the ferry on Tuesday over to Wellington; which we haven't yet booked; must do that tomorrow.     We were sat in the campsite kitchen having our evening meal and in through the door walked Uli, our Austrian friend, last seen about a week ago at Motueka before he went off to do some sea kayaking. It's good to meet up again with other cycle tourists; there's a good camaderie amongst all of us; swapping stories of separate journies. Uli had just met up again with somebody he had last seen weeks ago down in Fiordland. We said our goodbyes later as he is off to the North Island tomorrow for his last 3 weeks. Thursday 18th March - getting ready for tramping A dull cloudy day and with a bit of drizzle in the afternoon before it finally started to get sunnier (a good sign for tomorrow); glad we delayed our departure for the Queen Charotte Track until tomorrow; it is forecast to be better then. It was yet another of those do nothing very much days apart from those pre-tramping chores of getting some food, washing some clothes and expanding not too much energy as we have 2 long tramping days ahead of us on Friday & Saturday. We booked our ferry to Wellington for Tuesday afternoon and that's about it. "
52,"We left our bikes in the campsite garage and with one day pack and one pannier each we walked the 400 metres down to the pier for the 09:00hrs sailing on the Endeavour Express boat for the 1 hour trip up Queen Charlotte Sound to Ship Cove, the start of the 71kms Queen Charlotte Track. The day was looking good and it stayed good and the forecast for the weekend was good - hurrah. This track is another of those 'civilised' tracks; there's no real wilderness out here; for example:- - you can get your luggage transferred daily by boat so all you need to carry is a light day pack, which is what we did. - you can buy food and drink at the overnight stops, which is what we did - you can actually mountain bike the whole route, which we didn't;I would love to do that sometime but Jo's not keen on anything other than a tarmac surface for the time being. There must have been about 20 people doing just that; mainly Kiwi's on  a long weekend trip So just after 10:00hrs we set off walking after first looking at the memorial to Captain Cook who stopped in Ship Cove 5 times during his 3 major world sailing expeditions in the 1770's. The only real climb of the day was straight away to get over a saddle before we dropped down to Resolution Bay after which the track undulated around the bays and then into Endeavor Inlet and around to Punga Cove. So it wasn't really a strenuous route just a long walk today.
     We got into chatting and walking with Kevin from Stoke-on-Trent (he was 10mths into a 12mth world trip) until Furneaux Lodge (after 3.5hrs) where we stopped for something to eat and drink; tea for one and beer for another.(guess who had what). All the mountain bikers were well into the beer; so much so that we left before most of them. It took one group of guys nearly 9 hours to 'ride' 27kms; they said they drank a lot, stopped a lot and they were just having a great time and weren't bothered in the least how long it took them - good for them. We walked it in under 7hrs. Punga Cove is actually a bit of an accommodation resort with all the appropriate facilities; swimming pool (too cold by 17:00hrs for that); restaurant (too expensive), bar(definitely have some of what they were selling) and they were doing a BBQ on the bar terrace by the waters edge, so we had some of that as well. An excellent end to the day. Today's interesting fact:- Ship Cove, on the South Island is actually further north than Wellington on the North Island: if you see what I mean. Check your maps- it's true. Punga Cove to Portage Bay - 25kms Today was slightly shorter but a lot harder; a combination of yesterday's long day and lots of ups and downs today made our legs a bit tired by the end; it was a gorgeous day to get tired in though. We left before 09:00hrs and finished about 15:30hrs it was a climb straight away to get up to Kenepuru Saddle after which the track either sidled round one side of the hills with views of Kenepuru Sound or went round the other side of the hills with views of Queen Charlotte Sound or climbed up and down along the crest of the hills with views of both Sounds; the views in all directions were just great. This section from Kenepuru Saddle onwards is a great mountain biking route.         There were two DOC camp/cooking shelters on the way; just handy for a rest and with good views from them; they were also patrolled by the local Weka (flightless bird) population who as soon as you sat down came looking for foodscraps; they didn't get any from us. Along the route there was quite a bit of ground damage in places; the responsibility of the local wild pig population. We did see 3 little pigs (true) but they ran off before we could ask them if they were still having trouble with their houses, well two of them anyway. The backpackers place at Portage Bay Shop was a neat place and our double room with balcony looked out to Kenepuru Sound. What was even better was the shop did takeaways so we had Fish & Chips for tea rather than spend time cooking - which would have been difficult anyway as we didn't have any food. Portage Bay to Mistletoe Bay and a boat back to Picton - 9kms A day for sauntering in the sunshine as we didn't have far to go and the boat wasn't due to pick us up until 15:30hrs. We also got an extra hour in bed as the clocks went back overnight and as we didn't leave until after 09:30hrs this was definitely an easy day. We weren't walking the final section to the track end at Anakiwa as we have done that bit before and we will have seen all the best scenery by the time we reach Mistletoe Bay. As per the first two days we had a longish climb straight from the off to get back onto the ridge and eventually to the highest point of the whole route at over 400 metres and naturally enough at this height some great views all round. We walked slowly, stopped regularly, met some the mountain bike guys again and finally descended to Mistletoe Bay and sat in the sunshine waiting for our boat, which duly arrived 5mins early.It was then just a 15min trip across the Sound back to Picton where our bags were waiting for us. Straight across the road for a coffee before heading to the campsite.     "
53,"A day of getting sorted out and getting clothes washed after the 3 days away tramping. It's great is this travelling lark but we forever seem to be washing clothes and a few of them are just about worn out now through continuous wear. Jo's throwing away a pair of shorts which have just about worn through and I've got a pair that just will not come totally clean; I will either have to change the washer woman or buy another pair - and these are top quality shorts, none of your cheap 'everyone gets a bargain at the Warehouse' stuff. The thing is, and which we tend to forget, that when we come away for a long trip with only the bare essentials then every bit of clothing we have with us gets worn far more often than it would at home so the clothing lifespan gets considerably shortened; the same rule applies to the tent which now needs to be replaced, after just over a year, before our next trip.  So after hanging nearly all of our clothes out to dry in the lovely hot sunshine we had today we wandered into town with one of us looking decidingly not the fashion man about town. Also one thing had got me slightly concerned; the weather forecast for tomorrow (when we catch the ferry) is for strengthening north west winds gusting up to 70kph late in the day which could mean a rough sea. Now, you will remember that I don't do bouncing boats very well (which is why I didn't go on the whaling trip with Jo at Kaikoura). Our ferry is at 13:30hrs and it's a 3hr crossing across the notorious Cook Strait which could turn out to be bad news for my stomach, so we went to the ferry terminal to try and get it changed to the 11:30hrs sailing which is on the Lynx, a more modern, more stable catamaran type boat that only takes 2.25hrs.The good news was we could get on it; the bad news was it would cost us an extra $30.The Finance Director's conclusion was that no stomach contents were worth $30; we'll buy some seasickness tablets instead and hope for the best. We paid a visit to the supermarket in the afternoon, that's another job that has to be done more frequently when travelling as we can't carry a lot of food with us.and consequently it is that bit more expensive as we can't buy in bulk. Don't get us wong, we aren't complaining just stating facts - this is our bed and we have to lie in it and are more than happy with that situation. We realised this afternoon whilst sitting in the shade out of the hot sunshine (it reached 23'C today) that this relatively settled weather we have been getting through March is what we should have got through February as well and we also realised we will be back home in just over a week - hope it's moved out of winter and into spring back there; we are not looking forward to putting long trousers back on.  Tuesday  23rd  March - Ferry to Wellington A lovely sunny, breezy day to leave the South Island. We left the campsite after 10:00hrs and went straight to the Pharmacy to get some magic pills to help make sure we (me, paticularly) arrived in Wellington with stomach intact; no big deal as it turned out as the crossing was reasonably smooth. At the Ferry Terminal the classification pointer behind the ticket counter pointed to a low moderate crossing on a scale from smooth-moderate-rough-very rough. If I ever walked in there and saw it pointing to 'very rough' then I would either be asking for a refund or another sailing; wild horses wouldn't drag on in those circumstances. The Picton Pharmacy had a nice little side number going; they made up their own seasickness pills; 4 pills for $6, enough for 1 crossing for 2 people - a good investment. We also followed Jo's rule for long boat trips; get a pile of food inside first and preferably something of the big breakfast variety, so that's where we went for lunch bfore getting on the boat - a full English breakfast. The principle being that It's far better to feel sick on a full stomach than an empty one. Also it might make me determined to keep the food down seeing as it cost me $12 to put it down there in the first place. Of the ferry at 16:30hrs and then unfortunately we had a long hill to climb because we were visiting some friends (Paul & Helen) in Wellington and they lived at the top of one of the hilly suburbs about 6kms from the ferry terminal - the legs were complaining somewhat after doing nothing for the passt 3-4 hrs. Wednesday 24th March - A day in Wellington A dismal start to the day with a Southerly change coming through that meant low cloud, low temperatures and some rain but luckily it brightened up by lunchtime. It didn't really matter what the weather did today as we were wandering from Internet Place (to add some pictures to the website & reply to e:mails) to Cafes(to have a coffee and later some lunch) to various shops (looking for gifts to take home). We met up with Helen on her lunch break and then later in the day after having some success buying presents we went to visit the Old St Paul's Church which is quite unique in that it is a wooden structure; the wood panelling and arches and the whole gothic type interior looks fantastic and it had a nice warm feel to it,so different from the standard cold, stone church interiors. Another story for the coincidences book:
Paul & Helen were away on the South Island for a tramping holiday and they met an American cycling couple from Seattle; this was the same couple who we met briefly at the Westport campsite a few weeks ago.
"
54,"A beautiful blue sky sunny day for our departure from Wellington.It took us 2 buses and about an hour to get to the Airport to pick the hire car up which luckily was a large Holden estate model so we had enough space to get both bikes in easily; it had all the whistles and bells as well. We were back to Paul & Helen's before noon and after loading everything up we were off shortly after and drove about 350kms up the West Coast to the Mt Taranaki area and to a cabin at a campsite at Stratford by 17:00hrs 'ish  A little secret: We told a bit of a porky (well, I did) when booking the car; you can't specify what car you want but I said that there may be 4 people with lots of luggage so they wrote that on the request form but couldn't of course promise anything. The result being we got this big car instead of one of those little 1.3 small models which we saw waiting to be picked up - we would have struggled getting the bikes in one of them. On our way up to Startford we saw evidence of the aftermath of the major floods that this area got some weeks ago. There was an area where the road crossed  the Rangitaki river beyond Wanganui that still looked quite devastated with mud and flood debris covering some of fields.The lady at Stratford campsite said she had never seen any storm like it before and yet 15kms further up the road she said they hardly got any rain at all. Lord of Rings: All the hooha about the final film has just about died down now but there still remain some reminders and the best is the huge Gollum on the top of a building at the Airport with his outstretched hand within tantalising reach of a large gold ring. Hard luck Gollum, it was not meant to be. Friday 26th March - to Auckland It got cold last night even being inside a cabin; the car's thermometer said the outside temperature was 5'C and that was at 09:00hrs! The reward, though, for the overnight clear skies and cold was a beautiful sunny day with the temperature gradually rising to 22'C as we drove the 400kms approx to Auckland; the car's air conditioning was brought into use - lovely. We saw 1 lone cycle tourist on the way up; which was about the only thing that grabbed the driver's attention. Driving a car is definitely not my favourite pastime and is only seen as a necessity for getting from Point A to Point B. We got to our accommodation near the Airport by mid-afternoon and crashed out (metaphorically speaking of course). Saturday 27th March - Auckland We returned the car (in one piece) in downtown Auckland by mid-morning and did the round of the shops etc to buy a couple of things before returning by mid-afternoon to our accommodation. We also called into an Internet Cafe and were amazed to get an e:mail from Hans, a Dutch guy who had come across our 'Across Australia and around Tasmania' travelogue; we met him briefly on that trip whilst in Victoria State. It's just great to hear from past cycling acquaintances and makes you realise how small at times this world is and also the wonders of the Internet for easy and quick communication.This couldn't have happened 10yrs ago. Cycling weather: We were chatting to Brian, the owner of Skyway Motor Lodge and he remarked on the number of cyclists who have turned up at his place in a car with their bikes in the back in this year having packed in cycling earlier than planned; It has certainly been a bad summer weather wise for cycle touring. Some guys even giving up on NZ and going across to Oz for better weather. Message to other cycle tourists planning a trip to NZ and flying in to Auckland: stay at the Skyway Motor Lodge (www.skywaylodge.co.nz) because:           - it's good value accommodation; dble ensuite rooms for $65 - free transport to and from the airport - free tea and coffee - free storage for your bike boxes/bags etc provided you stay at least 1 night on your return - and they are good people Here endeth the advertisement When I went to get my bike bags out of the store there must have been about 12 or more bike boxes in there. If you ever turn up at Auckland without a bike box then check out Brian first as he sometimes picks up boxes from the Airport that have been left there by incoming cyclists. Sunday 28th March - sort out and pack up A day of sunshine and packing bikes up, washing clothes(again) and generally getting sorted out; and also a day of lazing around, reading and relaxing and that's about it................the show's over.

55,Journal updates: We have a few more pics to upload and perhaps some changes to the text in places. The only thing we intend to do is to add a reference to another site where all the other pics we took on the trip will be held. Thanks for viewing.
56,"My wife, Merleigh, was very supportive although she never really shared my enthusiasm for the trip.  Fortunately, her belief that God watches over little children, fools and old men got her through the planning stages.  Then one day she asked if she could meet me somewhere along my planned route and camp with me.  That sounded great to me and soon thereafter I could tell she felt better about the whole idea.  In November of 2003 the guy in the big brown truck delivered a BOB Yak Plus trailer to my doorstep and the trip was on.    By the way, you can click on any of the photos in this journal to see a larger version."

58,"As I unloaded the bike and hooked up the trailer I realized I had more than just a few butterflies in my stomach.      This was a major adventure for me.  Fortunately the excitement quickly replaced the butterflies and in no time I was happily spinning down the nearly deserted highway. I made a brief stop at the little town of Kerman for a Sausage McMuffin with Egg and some orange juice.  From there it was nineteen miles to Mendota, the last 'town' I would see until the following day.  Along the way I passed a man carrying a bedroll and not much else.  I stopped to see if there was anything I could do for him.  He was hungry and tired.  I gave him some food and shared God's love for him.  He appeared grateful for both. As the day progressed a stiff wind grew from the west.  To compound matters, as I began the ascent into the mountains I noticed the pavement got rougher and was rather poorly maintained.  I was forced to watch the roadway much more closely to avoid potholes, asphalt patches and debris.      Despite the deteriorating road conditions my attention was drawn to the wildlife.  There were little cottontail rabbits everywhere.     Sharing space with the rabbits were squirrels, mice, snakes and a wide variety of birds.  At one point I watched a hawk swoop down and grab a quick meal.  A little later a coyote crossed the road in front of me carrying a rabbit in its mouth.   The sights, sounds and smells of nature made the time go by very quickly and it wasn't long before I saw the grove of trees that marked my destination for the night, Mercey Hot Springs. Mercey Hot Springs is a camping oasis in the middle of the desert.     Native Americans used the springs for bathing and recreation long before John N. Merci acquired the land for the purpose of raising sheep around the turn of the century.  He changed the name to Mercy Hot Springs to make it sound more Americanized.  Mr. Merci sold the property to a developer in 1912 who attempted to turn it into a resort.  The new owner changed the spelling to Mercey in an attempt to make it sound less medicinal.  But because the location was well off the beaten track the facility has never enjoyed much in the way of financial success.  Nevertheless, the current owners have built a very nice little swimming pool for the use of paying guests.  They also channeled the hot springs into a large, enclosed hot tub which definitely eases tired muscles at the end of a long day. After setting up camp I took a dip in the pool.  The water was refreshingly cool after the hot afternoon ride.    Then, after a satisfying dinner, I headed for the hot tub.  As I approached the tub I heard voices on the other side of the fence.    Because I'm not a  'clothing optional' kind of guy I waited until I had the place all to myself.    I was in bed by 9:00 p.m. and slept like a log until sunup.  Day number one was a good one.

59,"The day began with a very steep, two mile long climb to the south.     The grade was steep enough in places that walking the bike and trailer was easier than riding.  I was encouraged by the apparent lack of wind.  But when I crested the hill I could see dust blowing in the valley below. I knew I was in for a rough ride. Part of my gear for this trip included a tiny, hand-held ham radio transceiver.  Besides providing 2-way communication with other ham radio operators while in camp, it also enabled me to tune in the NOAA weather broadcast stations throughout the country.      A quick check confirmed my suspicions that the wind in the valley ahead was blowing straight out of the west at a steady 35 mph.  Groan! For the next two and a half hours my speed never got over six miles per hour.  My eyes watered from the constant pounding of airborne dust particles and every turn of the pedals was an effort.  I struggled across the open valley floor and then began another torturous climb to the 2,400 ft. pass ahead.  From time to time I would find shelter from the wind behind a large hill and would start to pick up a little speed only to be pushed back again.  After what seemed like forever I saw the sign on the fence belonging to the Summit Ranch.   I had reached the top and was happy to see the road head downhill again.   A little over an hour later I turned right on Highway 25 heading north toward Hollister and San Juan Bautista.  The wind had subsided to a mere 10-15 mph by now and was no longer blowing directly into my face.  With all the hard work behind me I realized that I was really hungry so I stopped in the little town of Tres Pinos at the Veranda Café.  I ordered a double hamburger, some potato salad and a Pepsi.  Refueled, I rode the final few miles to Mission Farms RV Campground in San Juan Bautista. For those contemplating a stay at Mission Farms, I'd like to offer a word of advice.  While the management honored my request for a tent site, they did it as a courtesy.  Mission Farms is designed to accommodate recreational vehicles only.  They do not have tent sites at their facility.  Nonetheless, they are sensitive to the needs of  bicyclists and will often exercise a good neighbor policy.  I was allowed to set up my small tent beneath a tree in a small, grassy area just inside the main entrance.  Thank you, Mission Farms, for your hospitality.   Once settled in for the night I set out to explore the town of San Juan Bautista and specifically the old mission located at the north edge of town.  The mission was established in June, 1797 by Father Lasuén.  It grew quickly in size but suffered the effects of numerous earthquakes over the years.  It seems there was always a construction project in process.  The history of this, and other early California missions, is very intriguing and can be found at various Internet web sites.   While visiting the mission I happened upon a man's wallet lying on the ground.  I contacted the mission authorities, a ranger, but the lady in charge suggested I turn the wallet over to the police.  I found the one and only police station in town but it turned out to be unmanned most of the time.   I took the wallet back to the campground and asked Mary, the lady at the front counter, to call the police switchboard to ask an officer to drop by.  Meanwhile I rode my bike the short distance back into town to pick up some food for dinner.  Before I could get to the store the ranger from the mission spotted me on the road and stopped to say that the owner of the wallet had contacted her.  She sent the man to the police station.  I was close by so rode over and met the man and his wife.  To make a long story short, the lost wallet was returned to its rightful owner, the police call cancelled and I was able to practice The Golden Rule in real life.  Like day number one, day number two ended on a high note.
"
60,"Cows turned out to be a major source of entertainment on my trip, but there is much about them I don't understand.  For instance, almost without exception cows would stop what they were doing and stare at me as I pedaled by.  They never turned their bodies, only their heads.  Some would moo at me, but most just stopped and stared.  And then there was the cow that played 'chicken.'  I was pulling a steep hill outside San Juan Bautista when I encountered a huge cow standing squarely in the middle of the road in the right hand lane.  I figured she would turn tail and run as I approached, but not this Bossie.  She stood her ground, head lowered, ready to defend her turf I guess.  I wondered if she was a member of some sort of cow gang.  Anyway, I dismounted and walked the bike around her.  She never moved a muscle so I can only assume she was having a bad hair day or something.   Okay, back to my travels.  Today was my official 'Dawdle Day.'  The calculated distance to Monterey was less than 40 miles so I decided to take my time, gawk at everything and just smell the roses.  It turned out to be a good plan. Once again I was faced with a steep climb almost immediately after leaving camp at Mission Farms on the way to Salinas.  The road has several, descriptive names including San Juan Canyon Road, Old Stagecoach Road, San Juan Grade Road and Salinas Road.  There were about four miles of leg-numbing pedaling before I reached the top, but the view from the crest was worth the effort.    About half way up I encountered 'chicken cow.'  I was also treated to a long stretch of wild roses growing alongside the road.  The bushes were in full bloom and the smell was incredibly sweet.   Dropping down into the Salinas Valley was another treat.  Although the road surface was rough and full of patches I didn't mind the slow pace.  There were so many things to see that I didn't want to miss a single thing. At one point I passed what had to be biggest strawberry field in the world.  It must have been two hundred acres in size.  The berries were bright red and absolutely huge.  My mouth watered for a taste but I couldn't bring myself to pick one.  The old Christian ethic was at work again.  I waved to many field workers along the way and they all waved back.  Many gave me the thumbs-up sign.  I silently thanked them for their hard work. Salinas seems to be a nice little town.  The drivers were polite and quick to share the road.  The only bottleneck I found was just south of town on Davis road, and then only for a short stretch of shoulderless pavement.  Before heading west again I stopped at restaurant with 'Waffle' in its name and fueled up.  I had ham and eggs, toast and hashbrowns alongside a huge strawberry waffle.  The waitress was skeptical that could finish my meal but obviously she didn't know much about bicyclists.  I did everything but lick the plate. I headed south out of Salinas and picked up Reservation Road going west.  It wasn't too long before I entered the town of Marina.  At the intersection of Reservation Road and Del Monte Blvd. I found the famed Monterey Bicycle Path.    It was a real treat not having to worry about automobile traffic.  Of course there were joggers, skaters and other bicyclists on the path but they posed little danger.  As I proceeded south I could smell the ocean.  Finally, I got my first glimpse of Monterey Bay and I was ecstatic.   I continued down the bike path following the Pacific Coast Bicycle Route until I came to Pearl Street and the approach to Veterans Memorial Park where I planned to spend the night.  The climb to the park was every bit as brutal as others had described and I ended up walking my bike part of the way.  But I eventually made my way to the main entrance and found the hiker/biker area.  I searched for a level place to stake down my tent but something inside me just didn't feel right.  There were a couple other tents there, but no people.  My gut feeling was so negative that I repacked my trailer and left.   I found a reasonably priced motel on Fremont Blvd., checked in and took a long, hot shower.   Then, with the trailer stored safely in my room I headed back to the beach area and the municipal wharf.    I spent a lot of time looking at the boats in the harbor which brought back many fond memories from my childhood. My father was a commercial fisherman out of Seattle so I was no stranger to boats, docks and sea water.   Then I rode down to Cannery Row and checked out all the tourist traps but didn't spend a dime.    From there I rode further along the bay on Ocean View Blvd. before finally heading back to my room.    There was a Denny's just down the street where I had dinner before going to bed.  Day three was as good as it gets.
"
61,"  Today's ride would mark the first time on the whole trip that I didn't have some sort of headwind to contend with.  In fact, there were times when the wind was actually at my back.  What a strange feeling it was to see the flag on the back of my trailer hanging limp while my bike computer showed me moving along at upwards to fifteen miles per hour.  Hey, I could learn to like this. Riding along the Salinas Valley reminded me that this is one of the richest agricultural regions in the entire country.  Lettuce was the most recognizable crop being grown and the fields stretched for miles in all directions.  The crops require an enormous amount of irrigation and I was treated to a brilliant light show from the morning sun making rainbows in the spray.   I tried to capture the colors with my digital camera but it didn't work.  Despite the beauty all around me, I kind of missed the cows. After a couple hours on the road it felt like my bike and I were on autopilot.  The road was nearly flat so there wasn't a lot of shifting to do.  There weren't many curves to negotiate so steering was pretty much fixed.  I was just cruising along in my own little world while my mind wandered aimlessly.  Then, out in the middle of nowhere I saw a sign announcing the entrance to Mission Soledad.  What a surprise.  I hit the brakes, jogged right and found myself  sitting in front of another Spanish Mission dating back to the eighteenth century.    The place was deserted except for a small mobile home on the edge of the property where I assumed the caretaker lived.   I wandered the mission grounds for nearly thirty minutes, completely alone, trying to envision the Padres as they ministered to the Indians or the occasional settler.     The grounds showed signs of being well cared for and there were many flowers in bloom.  I sat on one of the old benches, wishing it could talk, but it stayed quiet.    After a refreshing drink of cold water from a faucet by a rose garden I reluctantly got back on my bike and once again headed toward King City. I have only been to King City once before but I kind of fell in love with the place.  Actually, I fell in love with the San Lorenzo County Park on the outskirts of town.  The park is more than just another place to spend the night.  Rather, it is a history lesson with campsites.  Just beyond the entrance station are rows of antique farm equipment on display.  There is an old, one-room school house on the grounds sitting next to a turn-of-the-century railroad depot.  In the middle of everything is a huge old barn which has been turned into a museum.   Tonight I would have company in camp.  My wife, Merleigh, drove over the mountains from home to be with me.  She brought a slightly bigger tent that the one I carried as well as her own sleeping bag and Therm-A-Rest.  It was really great to see her again.  After a quick shower and a change of clothes we went into town.  I brought her up to speed on my travel adventures over dinner.  Then, as I contemplated the next leg of my journey, I made the decision to forego the extremely difficult route back over the mountains.  The next morning I tossed the bike and trailer into the back of Merleigh's pickup truck and traveled to Coalinga, California in style.
"
62,
63,"As there were no apparent campgrounds nearby, Merleigh and I began searching for a motel room for the night.  The woman who worked in the Chamber of Commerce was very enthusiastic about a bed and breakfast in the vicinity but I wanted something a bit more conventional.  So off we went in search of suitable accommodations.  There were numerous motels from which to choose but we didn't see much that didn't bring the name, Norman Bates, to mind, so we headed out of town to Interstate 5.  We found a nice Best Western at the intersection of highway 198 and I-5 and settled in for the night. The following morning I was in the shower by 6:15 a.m. and out the door soon after 7:00 a.m.  Merleigh saw me off and then went back to bed for another hour of sleep.  As for myself, I was anxious to get back on the bike.  It promised to be a warm day with a breeze from the west.  It doesn't get much better than that. This part of the San Joaquin valley is much like the Salinas valley in that it is basically flat land with extremely rich soil.  Once again I found myself riding adjacent to heavily irrigated fields with arrow-straight rows of greenery.       Even better, I rode past a number of dairies as I approached Hanford, so the cows were back.   I also ran across a small, picturesque ranch with some sheep grazing beneath a few shade trees.  There was an ewe with a tiny little lamb at her side.  I tried to take a picture but the wary mom led the baby away before I could get a closeup.   I stopped at a fast food joint for a bite of lunch in Hanford but the kid behind the counter had an 'attitude' so I walked out.  I have made a pact with myself to no longer put up with snotty service people.  I found another place nearby and the young woman behind the counter made me feel like I really meant something to them.  I thanked her for the service and hunted down the manager to let her know what a great employee she had.   After a satisfying lunch I continued on toward Visalia.  The plan was to spend my last night on the road at a KOA just outside Visalia even though it would put me a mere 35 miles from home.  I arrived at the campground just in time to fall into line behind a couple with a beautiful, 34 foot 5th wheel.  When it was my turn to register the lady behind the counter asked me what type of RV I had.  I told her it was a three foot travel trailer.  She looked me straight in the eye and asked the question again.  I pointed out the door to my bike with my BOB Yak trailer.  She laughed and assigned me to a tent site with a big shade tree.  Merleigh showed up ten minutes later.  We set up the tent and went into town for a little sightseeing and dinner.  We returned to camp at dusk, watched the sun go down and went to sleep.  "
64,"1. Never once, while I was on tour, did I wish I'd stayed home and watched Oprah.  2. Gasoline prices were at record high levels.  I saw premium selling for $2.75 per gallon in one place.  I felt pretty smug knowing I had traveled nearly 400 miles and didn't buy a thimble full of gas.  3. Dogs were not the problem I feared they would be.  4. Automobile drivers were, for the most part, very thoughtful and courteous.  They gave my bike and trailer a wide berth, honked, waved and smiled at me everywhere.  5. You see things from a bike you would miss while driving an automobile.  6. People throw an incredible amount of trash along the roads from their cars.  I pulled into my driveway well before noon just as the kind lady who took care of my cat was leaving.  We chatted for a minute while I put my bike in the garage.  Then my beloved cat came out to greet me.  I thought I would have to have him surgically removed for a while as he wouldn't let me get more than six inches away from him.  I really wanted to take a shower but he wanted to snuggle in my lap.  He won. I consider my first long distance bicycle tour to be a complete success.  I achieved everything I had set out to do, and more.  What else can I say except that traveling by bicycle is great 'mental floss.'  So, would I do it again?  (grin) What do you think?  One last note  If you enjoyed reading about my travels, I would appreciate your taking a minute to sign the guest book associated with this journal.  Thank you.

66,"I first thought of biking coast to coast when I was about 14.  My bike was my ticket to adventure.  It brought me to baseball games, downtown, on adventures with friends, and to rendezvous girlfriends.  Biking was as much a part of my live as food and sleep.  Then on my 16th birthday, I got my driver's license.  Although I still rode, other things in life took on greater importance.   As an adult, I have toured extensively with my wife, mostly in Europe - the two of us happily carrying our gear from village to village.  We actually met on a bike ride - a fundraiser for the MS Society Fundraiser in Minnesota.  My friend and I were passing  her while climbing a hill, and the thought of trying to strike up a conversation was all the excuse we needed to slow our climb. The rest is history.  As Judy tells the story, we were interchangeable.  She thought we were both cool guys in bandanas, and liked our company and attention.  In the end, we both dated her at one time or another, but happily, Judy and I ended up together.      I took to riding a mountain bike almost exclusively for 10 years.  Then last summer, I bought a Cannondale R2000 road bike, and was immediately taken with the smooth quick handling. Out of the saddle, climbing a hill, you could just feel the bike being propelled upward, all a result of your own power.  I just never got that feeling from a mountain bike.  So I rode a lot last year, and while on a 3 day circumnavigation of Lake Champlain with Judy and John, a close friend, the idea of a cross country ride was reborn in my mind.  Judy and I had talked about doing it sometime, but the timing wasn't great for her just now.  So John and I started talking about the two of us doing it.  The idea took on a life of its own, until we had talked about it too much to turn back.  So here we are.           There have been many equipment lists posted in other journals, so I'm only going to add a few general comments.  To make uploading this journal easier, I'm bringing an Apple 12"" PowerBook and a Canon Digital camera.  Since we are staying in motels, most of which will have phones, internet access should be fairly easy.  I've packed the computer in a kayaking dry bag which, in addition to being totally watertight, allows you to blow it up a little providing some cushioning.  I was advised to put a little envelope of silica gel inside to keep the potential dampness out.  I also am bringing a Suunto Vector wrist computer mounted on my handlebar.  It provides altitude, compass, temperature and barometric information.  Finally, I'm bringing an ipod with over the ear style earphones for those long isolated stretches. (For safety reasons, I'll only use one earphone.) Most of the tool lists I've seen are way overdone in my opinion.  We're bringing all the obvious tools for tire repair, a small multitool, small bottles of chain lube and degreaser, a shop rag, and that's about it.  We're not bringing cable cutters, freewheel removal tool, chain tool (our chains have a removable link, so none is needed), etc.  Hopefully, these will be wise choices. Thanks to all who have supported us, some of whom thought us crazy, but supported us anyway.  And to all who have pledged a contribution to Habitat for Humanity, a special thanks.  But mostly, thanks to Judy and Cher, our wives and partners who have encouraged us every step of the way.   "
67,"Addison Independent3-22-04 By PETER CONLONMIDDLEBURY - When biking buddies Dan Borden of Cornwall and John Stark of Middlebury hit the road on their Cannondales next week, they hope to accomplish two things: complete their 3,160-mile journey without incident and raise $5,000 for Addison County Habitat for Humanity.        On Thursday, the pair will fly to San Diego, Calif., where they will begin a journey that could take them through snow in New Mexico, searing heat in West Texas, and stifling humidity along the Gulf Coast. Their destination is St. Augustine, Fla.  Borden and Stark are following a route recommended by Adventure Cycling, which estimates the men should be able to handle 55 miles a day and complete the effort in 63 days. Borden said they expect to do better.  'We expect to do it in six to eight weeks, with about 45 days of actual riding,' he said.        While the pair fully expects to enjoy their travels - they will stay in motels and with friends along the way rather than be weighed down with camping gear - the ultimate beneficiary will be Habitat for Humanity's efforts in Addison County.  That effort has already created one home off Route 116 in Middlebury and is nearing completion of another home off Mead Lane in Middlebury. The organization, which builds homes for low-income people (who must contribute time on the project), is already thinking about where to begin the next house in the area, and the $5,000 or more the men plan to raise will provide a major shot in the arm.  All pledges will go directly to Habitat for Humanity as Borden and Stark, both self-employed, will cover their own expenses.  "
68,"Today is the day.  All the rushing around to be prepared and too little sleep blissfully gives way to much needed down time - a 3 hour layover at JFK and a 5-1/2 hour flight.  John picked me up promptly at 5:15 am, with the bikes all loaded in the truck.  We had a little scare as it was starting to rain and the boxes were uncovered in the back of his truck.  A lot of rain  would have rendered the boxes useless for travel.  But thankfully, it remained a sprinkle, and all arrived well.  John had the foresite to dress in shorts for the occasion, despite the Vermont early spring cold.  For me, upon arrival in San Diego, one of the first orders of business was to expose a little leg. John's cousin Frank graciously picked us up at the airport and welcomed us into his home.  Tomorrow we'll assemble the bikes and run any last minute errands before saddling up Saturday morning.     "

We decided do the ceremonial tire dipping in the Pacific today, and incorporate it into our last minute preparations since Frank's house is almost 25 miles east.  Then we can start Saturday past most of the traffic, and at about 400 feet elevation.  We took the Trolley, which is part of San Diego's transit system, down to near the starting point at Dog Beach.  (The trolleys and the buses both take bikes in San Diego - a nice touch.)  As the name implies, it  is indeed a frolic ground for dogs to run around and play with other dogs and the water.         After getting our tires and Johns shoes wet, we were off.  He had been stuck holding both our bikes while I took some photos, and a wave came up from behind.    We followed the San Diego River Floodway on an off-road path for a while, before challenging Friday afternoon rush hour traffic.  Thankfully, most of the roads had a marked lane for bikes, but it was a challenge. We'll be up early tomorrow and be on our way.  We still have to go to the post office in the morning.  We'll be sending back some stuff before we even get started!  I had packed more cold weather clothes than needed after reading journals from previous years showing snow in the mountains early in the ride.  But this year, it's apparent that most of those clothes won't be needed, so home they go.  We'll also send a pedal wrench and bike packing material to a friend in St. Augustine for later use.   "

John's brother-in-law Ross is joining us for a couple of days, and met up with us at Frank's.  We were ready to set off to the post office and to get breakfast, but my tire had gone flat overnight and needed to be repaired.  Then what was to be a quick trip to the Post Office took much longer.  The PO didn't open until 9, and John broke off a valve stem and got our second flat of the young trip.  We headed back to Frank's, loaded our gear, and set off for real.  We hadn't gone 100 feet when Ross' rack started acting up.  There was no solution short of a new rack, so back to town we went.  At least our misadventures were equally distributed among the three of us.    It was 1 o'clock when we finally got on the road.  The route followed a gentle grade up through urban East San Diego County.  Traffic gradually thinned out as we climbed to the town of Alpine.  It was great to be on the road at last.  We arranged accommodations and had a nice mexican meal, before retiring, tired but content.   "

From Alpine we biked through the Sweetwater River watershed which provides water to the San Diego area.  The surrounding vegetation is chaparral, which is highly flammable, resulting in many of the forest fires we've read about in Southern California.  The route takes us to our first stretch of Interstate riding on I-8.  We had 35 mph swirling Santa Ana headwinds/crosswinds which slowed us to a crawl.  One bridge we crossed had a sheer 1000 foot drop off to the side, and when the crosswind blew us that way, it seemed the safer bet to ride closer to the interstate traffic than over to the side.  Fortunately, traffic was light and the bridge fairly short, so we made it through.      We had good roads the whole way, but darned those winds.  Ross turned off to head homeward, and John and I continued to climb to about 4000 feet before descending into Pine Valley.  When we arrived we were trying to decide if we should press on.  I called ahead to see if any rooms were available farther ahead, when one place started telling about their honeymoon suite.  When she got to the part about the mirror over the bed I had to cut her off, as that was an amenity neither John or I were willing to pay extra for.  We decided to stay in Pine Valley at the Pine Valley Inn Motel, where Dan & Ray put up us in a nice clean room and took good care of us for $49.  Pine Valley is a picturesque little town complete with a bike shop, big grocery store, diner, ice cream stand, and a gourmet coffee shop that opened at 5:30 am.     "

The next 40 miles were short climbs and descents on smooth Old Hwy. 80.  The road parallels I-8, and is therefore lightly traveled.  The wind picked up once again, but the terrain wasn't as challenging as yesterday.  We're so close to the border we could throw a rock and hit Mexico, and the Border Patrol is everywhere.     We had an outdoor lunch at the restaurant at Jacumba Hot Springs Spa with much needed shade provided by the lattice work overhead.  They cater to the many bikers who come through, and offer rooms, hot springs, and even massages for tired muscles.  We've found that so many people have done the Southern Tier Route that nobody we meet thinks we're crazy, and in fact, we're not even a novelty.   At one point I was cycling alone and stopped for a rest, and there was true, dead silence.  I felt like I was the only person on earth.  A rare moment.     At last we finished the mountains on this first stage after a cumulative climb of 8500 feet.  We then re-entered I-8 and descended for 7 miles.  To play it safe, we had to keep our speed down to about 30 mph due to the tricky winds.  After the descent we rode on Route 98.  By this time the winds had calmed down, and we had a fabulous spin on a slight downgrade for about 20 miles.  Then we headed north to El Centro to end our day.  John is retired military, so we're staying in the ""bachelor"" housing at El Centro Naval Air Station.  The accommodations are amazing.  Spotless, with coffee, refrigerator, microwave and phone in the room, and a public area with large screen TV and free videos - all for twelve bucks!       A couple of packing notes:  the flip flops I am now wearing offer the best weight to utility factor of anything I packed.  They weigh almost nothing, and have a great aaahh factor for when you get off the bike.  The other item I packed that I'm getting a lot of use out of is a small digital voice recorder that I keep easily accessible so I can make spoken notes of thoughts and observations I'm having.  Sure beats trying to write and ride at the same time. Well, we're both pretty tired, so off to bed."

There's a purity to the heat, unsullied by humidity.  That said, the desert really threw us a challenge.  Leaving when in the season when we did, we had hoped to avoid both cold late winter temps, and extreme heat.  But it has been unseasonably hot in the southwest recently, so we have to settle for one out of two.  That we are still carrying long biking pants and fleece seems almost comical, but we may still need them in the elevation in New Mexico still ahead. After John's obligatory McDonald's breakfast, when available (2 sausage McMuffins-hold the bun-and a senior coffee), we headed up route 86 toward Brawley.  Although there was a bit of traffic, the road was smooth, and with a wide shoulder.  Temperatures were already in the mid 90's by 10 am.  Our route took us east through the Imperial Valley, with lush irrigated fields of carrots, alfalfa and citrus groves interspersed with vast expanses of desert.   The fields gave way to a vast expanse of empty desert as we entered the North Algodones Dunes Wilderness Area.  For all back in northern climates, here they use plows to clear the roads of drifted sand.    We were warned of very limited services along this stretch, and as the temperatures started to soar, we made it to our final water stop of the day.  The map showed it as the town of Glamis, but it was nothing more than a tent, and a couple trailers that cater to the sand dune four wheelers.  On weekends, and during spring break, the area teems with enthusiasts, and food is served.  But today, midweek, an ice cream bar and cold soda was the best there was.  Still, we were grateful for that.   (Updated Scoreboard - Vehicles 3, Rattlesnakes 0) Six miles beyond, was a similar outpost which was to be our last services for 41 miles.  By now, my thermometer read 115 degrees in the sun, which was probably a little overstated.  But the ambient temperature was about 105, and it was still only 1:00 in the afternoon.  With literally nothing ahead - no water, no towns, no food, not even any shade - we decided the best course of action was to wait out the heat.  We met a nice group of four wheelers from Minnesota, where I grew up.  They've been doing this for years, towing their equipment in trailers all the way to this destination a couple times a year.  I've always been amazed at all the different sub-cultures that exist. For those camping, roadside camping along most of this stretch is legal.  But we aren't carrying camping gear, so that's not an option.  After stocking up one last time on snacks, and water at $3.50 gallon, we set out around 3:00.  We tried to time it late enough that sun would be at our back and getting lower, but early enough to ride a minimum after dark.  As we finally approached our destination of Palo Verde, the Chocolate Mountains appeared as the sun started casting colorful low light.  Although we were really whipped, scenery was still to be appreciated.         We had called earlier to the only motel in town, so we checked into our waiting room, totally spent.  A quick shower and a burger later, were in bed by 8:00."
74,"VITALS Miles:  20    Average Speed:  13.5    Final Elevation:  500 feet    Today's Climb:  100 feet    Cumulative Climb:  10,662  feet    Weather:  95 degrees, sunny & a little cooler  Wind:  Light SW  5 mph Blythe, CA   Wednesday March 31, 2004 John Stark Dan and I arrived in Blythe this morning after a short 20-mile ride.   By far our easiest day. Yesterday we left El Centro, US Naval Air Facility, at about 7AM and arrived in Palo Verde some 93 miles later at 7 PM.  At the naval base our rooms were $12 and free laundry was included, thanks to John being retired military, Hopefully we will get a chance to stop at many more bases During the heat of the day, which was about 100 degrees Fahrenheit, we stopped at Glamis, a lovely garden spot which consisted of a store, that's it. This store was made up of high prices and poor attitude. This is something you can get away with when the nearest town is 40 miles away.  The heat was so fierce at noon that I napped under a tin roof on a picnic table. Next stop was Palo Verde 41 miles later.  In the AM I drank 4 qts of water. In the PM more.  Not a ride I want to repeat soon. Of course, since we are traveling through the southern deserts of the country, there will probably be considerably more of the same. A positive note about low humidity and high heat is that my tears evaporate immediately leaving my face dewy and fresh.    After 2 days of 84 and 93 miles this is our rest day.  I decided to catch a movies, Dawn of the Dead, the bloodiest movie I have ever seen, lasted 10 minutes and walked out. Our next big town before Phoenix is Wickenburg, a 2-day ride. Then on to Phoenix and the bright lights. Today I purchased my first tube of Desitin, for those of you not in the know, this is diaper rash ointment,  Cher used this on the girls, what's good enough for them is good enough for me.  One of the things about a lengthy bike ride is the vicious way that skinny seat attacks one's butt. This might seem like whimpering.  Dan likes to be far ahead of me, he complains that my sobs are distracting. That's it from John Stark and Daniel Borden lost in the great southwest deserts.       "
75,"Filed by John Thursday, April 1, 2004 Salome, Arizona John Stark We left Blythe, CA shortly after 7 AM pedaled a few miles and crossed the Colorado River.  At this point the time went forward an hour, not an auspicious way to begin the day.  I went the first 7 miles with my brake on. At this point going back to bed was probably not a bad idea. Instead I got lost and went 78 miles. Dan only traveled 62.  I pointed it that it takes a real man to do an extra 16 miles; he said something about only a real fool would do it.  Except for the wind it was much cooler today.       For quite a ways we traveled on I-10 a major highway.  Since it is the only road going east, so bicycles are allowed on it.  Rubber debris from blown tires was constant on the soft shoulder.  Every mile or so there would be burned pavement from blown tires or accidents.  We finally got on route 60 with the requisite towns we have become used to. A store is quite often the only thing in town. The country is spectacular with the mountains surrounding us, large cactus have started springing up.  Tomorrow we will stay in Wickenburg, which is a destination stop for western gear and memorbialia. Tomorrow will be a short day, unless of course, I get lost again.  Filed by Dan Today we said goodbye to California, as we crossed the Colorado River into Ehrenberg, AZ.  There, we rode on I-10 for 33 miles.  It's wasn't the most relaxing riding.  Traffic came from behind so fast that I gave up looking for it in my mirror, and just hoped to not hear the sound of the rumble strips being crossed.  One 5 mile stretch had grooves four inches wide and an inch and half deep running diagonally across the entire width of the shoulder, so every thirty feet or so, your bones got a jarring.  But as usually happens, the road improves, and soon I was spinning along new pavement at 20+ mph. The route exits the interstate briefly at Quarztsite, famous for its rock and mineral deposits.  Soon after, it leaves the interstate for the day for good.  In the afternoon, a mighty south crosswind came up.  I asked an elderly woman I met at cafe stop if it's always so windy.  She assured me that it isn't, that it's just fixin' to rain soon.   With about 5 miles to go, the road bears a little north, allowing the wind to help give a push up the last climb of the day.  So here I am, at Sheffler's Motel in tiny Salome, AZ.  Good night all.       "
76,"Filed by John Friday April 2, 2004 Wickenburg, Arizona John Stark It was a cold and rainy day!  We left Salome this AM with a cold rain and the wind in our face Aguila is about midway between Wendon and Wickenburg, 22 miles from each town. Five miles from Aguila I had a flat tire.  I almost chuckled because it was the front tire, easy to fix, I've always had flats on the rear, hard to fix.  In no time at all I had the tire changed.  Unfortunately the spare had a leak, as did the next spare. By this time I was freezing, with no more spares.  I hitched a ride into Aguila and met Dan who had a spare tire.  The restaurant, Two Pelicans Pub and Grub, had a laundry and a wonderful waitress her name is Jeri.  During pit stops I would step off into the bushes a few feet, where there are so many snake holes that the ground caves in as I walk.  This of course made me a little wary.  As I was biking ahead of me I saw a large rattlesnake that appeared dead.  A couple of days ago a nine-year-old boy was interviewed in the hospital having been bit by a rattler in his thumb.  This had happened when he lifted the snake on a stick.  When asked what he would do next time he saw a snake; 'jump back quick 2 steps, Mr. Snake can't strike that far.'  So I steered a wide path around 'Mr. Snake,' I was pretty sure he was dead, but not positive.   A follow-up to my tire story, 5 miles outside of Wickenburg my front tire again went flat.  Fortunately I was able to inflate it several times, enough to get me to Wickenburg.  It appears that I am constitutionally incapable of fixing the front tire on a bicycle. Tomorrow on to Phoenix.  Filed by Dan Sat. April 45:30 am About 10 miles into the ride yesterday, it was time to break out the mental gratitude list.  The rain was still falling steadily, and the wind was just starting to pick up.  I tend to view how challenging things are in a relative manner.  I need for things to get worse to appreciate how great it really is to be soaking wet riding your bike into a headwind in 50 degree temperatures.  But, I had food, water, my bike was working well, I didn't have to ride 100 miles to catch a plane in time or lose the non-refundable fare, I didn't have any flat tires (sorry John), it wasn't 105 degrees, I was healthy, have good friends and family, and I'm out here doing something I love.  It made things much easier. At the beginning of the day I was thinking, hey, Wickenburg is supposed to be a cool Western town, and we'll probably be in about 1:00 and could do some site-seeing.  Within an hour, all I could think about was the town of Aguila ahead, and hopes of a warm cafe to get out of the rain.  I remembered how if I go running in the rain or snow, I sometimes wear ski goggles so I can see.  Has anyone out there tried this on a bike? We stayed on route 60 all day, which was a good two lane road with generally nice shoulders.  There would be only two towns along the way - Wenden, which was only 6 miles into the ride, and Aguila, 22 miles farther.   On the west side of town, there wasn't anything except for a small market, where I asked about a cafe inside.  Thankfully, only 1/4 mile further, my hopes were realized. Two Pelicans Pub & Grub became my refuge for a couple of hours.  My hands were so numb I couldn't get my handlebar bag off the bike at first.  Once inside, I commandeered a booth and ordered coffee.  I knew I was ahead of John, but I didn't know by how much when.  I called several times on the cell phone and left messages.  By now an hour had passed, and there was a pretty good size puddle forming under me on the booth seat and floor.  It was nice hanging out with the locals shooting the breeze.  I was still wet and chilled though, and found that there was a small coin operated laundry in the back of the building.  Everything I owned had been packed in ziplocks and plastic bags and stayed dry.  I was able to put on fresh clothes, dry my wet clothes and get warm again. I was getting worried about John and went out to look down the road, when a pickup truck slowed quickly and out jumped John.  We spent another hour there with our waitress Jeri's good cheer, and were off again, dry, fed and watered.     The remaining ride was uneventful, except for John's final flat of the day.  We had a gradual climb up to 2400 feet, and a strong headwind, but no more rain.  The last 8 miles were on a downhill grade, but with the wind, we still had to pedal hard.   Found a great place to stay on the west side of town - The Western Hotel. It didn't look like much from the outside, but ours is a large spotless room with a king and queen bed, refrigerator, microwave, TV,  phone, sitting area with couch. and coffee maker - all for $44.  My firrst task was to procure a newspaper to ball up and stuff in my shoes to help dry them out. Thanks for the great idea Marc!  After dinner, we settled in to watch the Coen brothers movie, O Brother Where Art Thou, and patch a few tubes, then to bed. Today we're going to be joined by Brian, a guestbook contributor who lives in Phoenix.  Weather permitting, he'll ride up to meet us half way, then we'll all ride to Phoenix together. Thanks to everyone sending messages through the guestbook.  We won't be able to respond to everyone, but we read and appreciate them all."
77,"Filed by John Saturday April 3, 2004 Flagstaff, Arizona  Fort Tuthill Recreation Area John Stark We made it to Phoenix at about 2 PM leaving Wickenburg about 8 AM.  Chilly to start with over present east wind trying to blow us back west. Coming down a long grade, the wind was so strong we were only making about 12 mph. At about the 25-mile mark we met Bryan from the Phoenix area who had ridden up to meet us.  Big guy with a great heart, took us to his home, introduced us to his wife and children.  He then took us to the Phoenix airport to rent a car.  We turned down an invitation to stay for dinner and spend the night with them.     After renting a car we drove to Flagstaff and plan to hike the Grand Canyon tomorrow.  This is an Air Force recreation base; thank god I am retired military.  This is a very impressive place, hotel rooms, cabins, best of all cheap.  Both military bases have been far superior to their civilian counterparts.   After only biking 50 miles my butt is less sore than usual, that doesn't mean I'm not suffering, still enduring.  It will be good to get off the bikes for a couple of days.  My good friend Moore Newell hiked the Appalachian Trail last year taking 6 months to complete it.  Right now 6 to 8 weeks seems like more than long enough to say nothing about 6 months. Ben Franklin said, 'Experience keeps a dear school, but a fool will learn in no other'.  I woke up to this AM to find that I had still another flat tire.  Dan has been saying that he doesn't use tire changing tools to put the tire back together because it causes pinches in the tube, i.e., flats.  Finally I decided to try his way, ola no flat.  At a bike shop I today I mentioned this to the mechanic. Oh yeah he remarked much too much chance of getting a flat, using tools.  Being a quick study this only took me five or six flats to absorb. Just want to put in a plug for my wonderful wife Cher who has been so supportive of me on this journey.  Without her backing and encouragement I wouldn't be here.  Thanks Cher, I love you. Tomorrow Grand Canyon. Filed by Dan Sat. April 310:30 pm After a good night's sleep, we stopped at The Horseshoe Cafe right on Route 60 in town, where you can get pancakes with your smoke filled room.  I came out of the rest room and there was cloudy in there.  However the food was good, and they had peanut butter, which I had been in search of on a menu since the start of our trip.   Its unlikely next door neighbor, The Pony Espresso, is a smoke free coffee house with a hippy feel to it.  They also serve fresh baked goods, and have an internet terminal.   We headed out of town toward Phoenix to meet up with Brian.  It was cool, and a little breezy, but the sun was coming out, and we had a gradual downhill grade.  The Adventure Cycling Route says to turn off Route 60 onto Route 74 in Morristown, but Brian had suggested staying on Route 60 into Phoenix in order to avoid a later stretch on Lake Pleasant Road, which is narrow, with traffic and no shoulder.  Even Adventure Cycling warns to be careful there.  Our alternative route was brand new asphalt, which had quite a bit of traffic, but also an enormous 12' wide shoulder.  The smooth ride, downhill grade and new friend more than overcame any traffic annoyance.  We had a quick lunch at McD's, and continued into Phoenix.  We needed a bike shop for some repairs for John's bike, and Brian led us straight there.  I'd like to give the shop a quick plug, but I don't remember their name.  I'll update later if I can find out.  Brian took us to his house nearby, and we met his wonderful wife Sandy, and their three kids.  They were so warm and welcoming, and they made our city biking easy.   Brian took us to the airport to get a rental car, and then we were off to Flagstaff for our Grand Canyon side trip.  We drove through the Red Rock country near Sedona, but is was nearly dark.  Hopefully, we can do the return to Phoenix in the daylight, where we plan to pick up where we left off on Monday or Tuesday.  What a great day!   BTW, for others planning to do the Southern Tier Route, Brian and Sandy want to continue their tradition of lending a helping  hand.  You can E-Mail in advance to click to show email."
78,"Filed by John Sunday April 5, 2004 Fort Tuthill Recreation Area Flagstaff, Arizona John Stark Rest day, no biking, hiked the Grand Canyon for relaxation.  This morning we woke up to snow on our car.  We are at 7000 feet elevation, but it is supposed to be warmer. By the time we reached the Grand Canyon the snow has disappeared but it was still cold and the rain had stopped.  It was to sprinkle a couple more times but there was considerable sun.  We hiked 3 miles down the Kaibab trail to Skeleton Point where we had a fine view of the Colorado River.  After lunch up we went. The climb seemed moderate, however if you listened to the other people or read the map it sounded like we had just completed what was considered a very difficult climb.  The trail had steps and was delightful. There was a woman; Dee Dee doing some publicity shots on the edge of the canyon clad in pedal pushers and a halter top, 1946.  Dutton might remember this story.  Having ventured too close to the edge over she went, the only thing that saved her was sliding down and off the cliff was  a mound of debris built up in her crotch stopping her momentarily.  A ranger risking his life grabbed a small bush above her and saw that the debris was trickling away and that he had to do something immediately. He grabbed her with his free hand and another ranger dropped a rope, which was secured, about her middle.  On the way her halter was yanked off and as she came over the rim all the photographers were standing there and they apparently did what photographers do.  She got more publicity than she expected, making all the magazines.  She thought the rangers should have been more careful.  This was 1946 and topless was a long way off.  Many of the other stories didn't end well, I won't recount them. The Grand Canyon was spectacular; many others have described it better than I can. Look it up. Tomorrow we are off to Phoenix to see Dan's cousin.  Then we will conquer the southwest, maybe subdue it.   Today the clocks changed, but not in Arizona, these are some independent folks. Filed by Dan Mon. April 59:00 pm Yesterday we hiked for a few hours in the Grand Canyon.  No matter how many times you've been there, you're never really prepared for the grandeur.  There's really no hint that it's coming.  The terrain is fairly flat forest leading up to the rim, and then it all opens up before and below you.  We were wondering what the reaction could have been of whoever discovered it. On my way up, a group was pondering during a rest what the 7 natural wonders of the world are.  My Judy and I have wondered about this too, but I had never checked for sure.  Like putting a jingle in your head, it was all I could think about the rest of the hike.  I had to check when I got back.  So for those keeping score at home, the Seven Natural Wonders of the World from the Grand Canyon's web site are: Mount EverestVictoria FallsNorthern LightsThe Great Barrier ReefThe Grand CanyonParicutin VolcanoHarbor at Rio de Janeiro Enough from me.  I'll let the picture speak for themselves.                   "
79,"Filed by John --Phoenix---Tempe----Apache Jct---Florence Jct----Superior Monday, April 5, 2004 Phoenix, Arizona John Stark Dan washed our clothes last night which left me with a speedo bathing suit and fluorescent yellow see thru rain pants to wear.  Quite a sight especially since my bathing suit has speedo in large letters on the back.   We are spending the night at Motel 6 on the southeast corner of Phoenix.  Tomorrow we will be leaving bright and early, see above.  Will try to put where we're going and where we have been. Aside from driving a car down from Flagstaff, this has been an unremarkable day.  Went and saw Ladykiller with Tom Hanks, a Coen Brother's movie. Bizarre and funny, this is why I love the movies.  Thanks for the suggestions for the Chamois Butt'r.  Hope it saves my butt.  An inordinate amount of time is spent,; thinking about my butt, too sore, asleep,    ual dysfunction.  God l pray there is no permanent    ual malfunction.  Moore tells the story of a prominent man in his eighties who had lost his    ual drive, when somebody said how sorry they were.  He said, 'on the contrary I feel like I'm finally able to get off a wild horse whose reins I had dropped.'   Filed by Dan Mon. April 5 10 pm It was really nice to have a complete rest day.  I went and had lunch with my cousin Susan, and their friend visiting from Sweden.  Her house was in the midst of a major expansion, which, like most of these projects, was running way behind schedule.  We still had a wonderful, but too short lunch in the back yard which backs up to the Squaw Peak Recreation Area.  I was sorry not to have been able to see her husband Lars.  I missed his great sense of humor.      Off to bed, and back in the saddle tomorrow."
80,"Filed by Dan Tues. April 6 5 pm Hi all,I'm posting from the public library in Superior Arizona because the place we're staying doesn't have phones in the rooms.  I'll try to put some photos on this page tomorrow.  This little town of 2500 has a really nice library with at least 4 computers with high speed internet access.  Pretty cool. Our ride started near the Phoenix Airport, and stayed on smooth roads through urban Tempe, Mesa, and Apache Junction.  It was 30 miles before we got out of the city, but Adventure Cycling's route took us on mostly lightly traveled roads.  Leaving the city behind, we turned on to Route 60 and started a gradual climb, ending here at about 2900 feet.  Route 60 was a four lane road with plenty of traffic and a wide shoulder.  At what seemed to be random intervals, there were guard rails that gradually angled in toward the road until it forced you into the traffic lane.  I'm not sure why they do it that way, but it made for a few harrowing moments.  We thought we were going to have a lunch break at Florence Junction, but the store there was no more, a casualty of the new road that bypassed it. Much of Superior is like that too.  There is the newer part of town on the main road, and the old part, Uptown, that still exist on the old grade.  They are starting to revitalize it and renovate some of the buildings, but it still has the feel of a town time passed. Tomorrow we start climbing right out of the gate - about 3000 additional feet I think.  We may have to make it a short day and stop in Globe because lack of services beyond it would make it too difficult to do in one day. There are a couple of Mexican restaurants in town that I'm eying.  Bye for now. Filed by John Thursday April 6, 2004 Superior, Arizona John Stark This is being posted from the Superior Town Library. It feels like home. In Middlebury, VT I was a trustee for five years. I was making good use of the library dozing on the couch upstairs, until Dan roused me.  We started out in Phoenix this AM and made excellent time until we hit Apache Junction where we stopped at a convienence store. Our next stop was Florence Junction, 17 miles later where we would have lunch. Last year they built the highway around the store in Florence.  By the time we got there they had packed up and gone probably last November. If there had been anything left on the stove it would probably be cold by now. So we had power bars and were on our way. There appears to be 2 houses in Florence, so I would suggest that if this garden spot was on your agenda it could probably be skipped. At the top of steep hill outside Superior I took a       spill and bruised my hand. Prior to this Dan and I had been discussing the benefits of shaving my legs, that is I had been doing the discussing. A friend of mine, who I met in a class, said the reason he shaved his legs were that, when not if, you fell if you had unshaved legs the skin came off in chunks and there was a danger of infection. With shaved legs you slid on smooth skin, much less damage. In              ton recently, I talked to a bike mechanic and remarked that he must race since he shaved his legs. His response was that he no longer raced but that he enjoyed the aesthetics of looking at his shaved leg when he was biking.  Sooo. I have thought that I could shave one leg and see how it works, of course I would post pictures. Since I generally fall to the right this would be the first one to be stripped. It will be a great conversation starter with some of the hermits of the southwest. They already think bikers are a strange breed. Used chamois butt'r today, much better on chafing, however butt still numb and sore. Fortunately Moore reminded me that after hiking the Appalachian Trail his feet are still numb, and that the     s would have great fun amusing themselves and their friends by sticking tacks on chairseats. I certainly do appreciate these helpful tips, keep them coming. Tomorrow could be a tough day as we immediately start climbing. Not sure where we will end up. Somewhere in Arizona I'm sure."
81,"Filed by John Wednesday April 7, 2004 Globe, Arizona John Stark Left Superior, AZ this morning, a town of hard times.  Several years ago the copper mine closed, then the highway was routed around the town.  Pretty much the whole town is boarded up.  We went straight up about a nine percent grade for about five miles.  Passing lane ends 1000 feet was a welcome sign, meant we were almost at the top.  There was a sign that said 12 miles to Globe. Dan told me at this point that it was pretty much downhill for the rest of the way into Globe.  We headed down a steep grade around a corner and faced another 4 miles or so of uphill and then once again that sign that passing lane ends 1000 feet, this time for real. Focus is when you are going 40 miles per hour down hill with a heavily laden bike.  Usually I pass Dan on downhill's for 2 reasons; I'm heavier and he knows better than to go that fast.  Remember that old experience keeps a dear school but a fool will learn in no other.  Twice I hit cracks in the road, going too fast to see them, thought I was going to lose my bike.  My motto has always been when in doubt straighten them out.  Seemed to work on skis, maybe not bicycles. We are staying in a Days Inn a beautiful place on the eastern edge of Globe. Globe is a booming town thanks in no small part to 2 international copper mines.  There was even a Wal-Mart where I was able to buy a headset for my phone, now I am able to do multitasking; riding bike, playing with my GPS, and talking on the phone. Today was a tough short day, about 27 miles.  Tomorrow will be a tough long day of 80 plus miles.  It will be an early night and early morning. On to Thatcher or Safford.  Filed by Dan After filing from the library in Superior yesterday, I ran into a group of 3 Brits that were doing our route, but east to west, and against the prevailing winds.  They had been camping and sleeping on church floors the entire trip, and had only paid for lodging one night.  Of course John immediately wanted to investigate this form of budget travel further, but I would have none of it.  In addition to the re-routing of the road, the recent closing of the copper mine there has been devastating. Short day today.  We slept from 8 pm until 6 this am.  I was really behind on my sleep, and it felt great.  I think I've also been behind the curve on nutrition, and have been forcing food through a poor appetite.  But the appetite seems to be coming back, and I'm feeling more myself. We climbed our first real mountain pass as we climbed out of Superior and through the Queen Creek Tunnel - it sounded like a freight train in there, and a couple of truckers thought it would be cute if they blew their horns at us.  Just after the tunnel, we took a rest.  John held a Pilates clinic for my benefit, so there we were roadside, bent over at the waist doing our stretches. After an incorrect road sign prematurely announced the top, we finally descended into Miami and Globe. In contrast to Superior, these are prosperous towns mainly due to the rich rock and mineral deposits, and the Phelps Dodge Copper Mine. I'll keep the narrative short as there are a bunch of pictures to post.  Hope you enjoy them!                                 "
82,"Filed by John Thursday April 8, 2004 Safford, Arizona John Stark Left Globe Arizona this morning at 8 AM and arrived in Safford, AZ this afternoon at 3PM.  This was a distance of almost 80 miles; we averaged about 16 MPH with fully loaded bikes.  This was our best time yet, either we are getting stronger or the terrain and weather was more cooperative or a combination of both. After our first 20 miles we stopped at a store in Peridot.  There we met Kevin half Apache half Dutch.  He is living on the San Carlos Apache Reservation; this runs from Globe to Pima, a huge area.  He gets public health service, dental, and reduced housing and many other benefits.  He leased 4 acres from the US Govt for 100 years for $25 an acre.  This land can be passed on to his heirs.  To take advantage of this one must be Native American or married to one.  Since I can't change my birthright I had no choice so I got married.  Technically, if one were to quibble, this might be called bigamy; I will leave it up to my other wife, Cher.  It is interesting that these disenfranchised people have this tremendous ongoing effort to help them.  When you look at blacks that certainly are at least as disenfranchised as Native Americans, our record is abysmal, at best.    After Peridot, the next stop was Geronimo 29 miles down the road, what a great name.  Unfortunately the one store in Geronimo was closed.  This has been a not uncommon occurrence  in this area.  Living appears to be hard; a lot of people are just eking out an existence Tomorrow we were faced with a 120-mile ride with steep mountain passes included before any lodging could be found.  We probably would have had to hitchhike or sleep on the roadside.  Let me assure you that idea of snakes snuggling up to me on the ground, don't bother me at all.  However thanks to tremendous assistance form Safford Chamber of Commerce and a retired mining engineer Gordon, we may have found an alternate route.  It is possible if we take this alternate route we may avoid the high point of 8200 feet.  To miss this climb would distress me not at all.    Tomorrow on to Lordsburg, New Mexico, about the same distance we went today. Filed by Dan As it is late, I'll just post a few photos, and save more for tomorrow.  I went for a walk through the town, and much to my chagrin, I forgot my camera.  Won't make that mistake again as I missed a few good shots.     "

We got a fairly early start today, only to lose an hour entering New Mexico, and going back on daylight savings time.  It's nice to be one hour closer to our loved ones.  We decided to take Route 70 all the way to Lordsburg because there was no way physically possible to take Adventure Cycling's route and make it to a motel in one day.  We are allowed on I-10 here, and will take 2 days to make the trip to Las Cruces where we'll probably take a rest day.     We were assured that that the route was totally flat, and were looking forward to an easy day, but we were led astray by our Chamber of Commerce buddy Gordon.  I'm sure if you've only driven it, it seems flat, but we climbed 1200' in one stretch - almost as much as we did going over the pass a couple days ago. John and I were making quick progress when I had my first flat in a while.  When I stopped to change it, there was another of those completely silent moments, when it was just me and the land.  I remember to stop more often to take it in. So much of the focus on a ride like this is mental, and going stretches of 40 miles without seeing another human being and without anyplace to stop can get into your head.  After Texas, I think I'll be ready for more signs of human presence.  I'm grateful to have John to do this trip with, otherwise the isolation would be too much.   I learned two things today 1)  Don't try to change a flat tire without taking all your baggage off the bike, 2)  If God gives you a hill to go down take the ride.  Who am I to try to improve upon it by pedaling.  I figured that at roughly 320 pedal revolutions per mile, we will pedal 1,043,200 times on this trip, so there's no shame in coasting. I've been using a little radio with one earpiece (never two for safety), and I'm afraid I'm becoming a country music fan.  Of course, that's about all there is, but I'm grateful for anything to break up the long stretches.  I think I'm going to ask Judy to send my ipod out. I'm looking forward to a couple of shorter days.      Filed by John Friday April 9, 2004 Lordsburg, New Mexico John Stark My friend Moore cautioned me not to listen to those people who say it is all-downhill.  Oh that I had heeded his words.  Left Safford this AM with the tip that it was all downhill and flat.  It was flat for about 2 miles then it went up for the next 25-30 miles.  In Duncan at the 40-mile mark a storeowner told us that it would be uphill all the way to Lordsburg.  It was fairly level the last 40 miles with minor hills.   My bout of NSB (numb sore butt) has been supplanted with another ailment.  It has been budding for the last week, EEEN(enlarged, erect, enflamed, nipples.  This is a painful and obvious condition; I have been catching sidelong glances at stores.  Built up testosterone and shirt rub are probably the causes.  Band-aid on the nipples will probably help part of the problem. Dan had a flat tire about 12 miles out of Lordsburg, so I took the lead. Thinking he was right behind me I was going between 19 and 22 MPH.  This effort was for naught as he was at least 20-30 minutes behind me.  This effort plus losing an hour have me ready for bed. We have been saved, I-10  allows bicyclists so we won't have to go to the mountains, yet.  It should be about 50 miles to Deming.  On Sunday we will ride into Las Cruces, Monday will be a rest day.   -The purpose of this trip is to raise money for Habitat for Humanity.  Our goal is to raise at least $5,000.00.  Many have already pledged or sent checks.  Any amount is appreciated - a penny a mile comes out to $31.60.           "
84,"Filed by Dan Sat. April 108 pm What a range of experiences today.  Had this HUGE tailwind for 60 miles!  We we're flying along I-10, often spinning at 25 mph.   It felt almost effortless, like having cruise control on.  Then the semis would pass and we'd catch their slip stream.  When he was about 3, my nephew Ariel's response when asked how a train goes -- Zooooooom!  We were zooming.  Normally, you ride low to cut wind resistance, but here, you sit upright to catch as much of the tailwind you can, like a sail.    We crossed the continental divide, which here, is virtually flat.  Not quite how I had imagined it, but certainly worth a photo  We met some great people from LA during a rest stop - Bernard, his sister Tia, and her son Shon.  With another brother, they have what sounds like a great tour company - Amazing LA Tours (www.amazingLATours.com).  They have planned tours, or will structure according to your desires.  If you're going there, check them out.  Our momentum was interrupted by my first flat of the day.  Rather than trying to change it on the side of the Interstate, I tried to limp along a mile or so to an exit by pumping it up, riding 1/4 mile, pumping it again, etc.  I must have damaged the tire by riding on low pressure, because when we got checked arrived at our motel, I had another flat, then another, then another, culminating with a blowout through the wall of my tire.  Thankfully, we had enough tubes, and I had a spare tire to boot.  We'll have to stock up on bike supplies in Las Cruces. Cher, it's funny you mentioned singing in the guestbook, because at one point as I was cruising along, I found myself singing at the top on my lungs to The Band's ""The Night they Drove Old Dixie Down"" on the radio.  Riding and singing left me a little winded, but it sure felt good. I'm using an eyeglass mirror for the first time, instead of handlebar mount I'm used to.  It takes a little adjustment, but I find it works great.  I'm also playing around a little with seat height to help with a tender knee.  If any bikers out there have any suggestions, or similar experiences with knee issues, please let me know.  Nothing serious, just a little annoying. Filed by John Saturday April 10, 2004 Deming, New Mexico John Stark Today we crossed the Continental Divide, the elevation was 4585 feet. To put this into perspective, I believe Mt Mansfield the highest mountain in Vermont is not as high.  We made amazing time averaging 18.2 mph on I-10.  It was about 60 miles to Deming and another 60 to Las Cruces.  We left Deming at about 3 PM and saw a storm approaching us from the east and also the wind had shifted around to the east.  We then decided to stop, which was extremely fortunate as Dan had at least 4 flats in the hotel room.  We just went to Wal-Mart where I had a flat.  Much better here than on the highway.  I understand that Joann Gruber, my twins Ali and Glory's fifth grade teacher sometimes reads our journeys to the class.  When they were babies their older sister, Liberty who is now in eighth grade would plague us to play 'squirt the baby.'  What we would do was lather Ali and Glory with Desitin from head to toe.  Then we squirt them back and forth across our king size bed.  Liberty would sit on end of the bed clapping her hands with glee and shrieking, 'Squirt the baby.'  I was reminded of this because I put so much Desitin on my butt last night that I slid right off the bed; headed for the door, next stop El Paso.  Fortunately Dan was thinking fast and slammed the door stopping my slide, leaving a huge white smear on the door.  Maybe Ms Gruber would allow Ali or Glory to read this to the class, I'm sure Liberty will also want to read this to her class. Many people have asked me is this harder than hiking?  It is different, last spring on the Appalachian Trail I lost 12 pounds in about the same time.  This is definitely not the case on this trip.  One of our big concerns is are the beds going to be too soft at night.  I never found anything soft on the Appalachian Trail.  What riding a bike is like is similar to running pretty hard for an hour or so taking a rest and doing it again. We ride for about 6 hours a day, which is like running for 6 hours, without the wear and tear on our legs.  Weight of all our equipment and bikes are about the same as what I carried in a pack.  My butt didn't hurt, and I didn't have to concentrate all the time.  Hiking I could occasionally doze off while hiking.  There is no dozing while riding a bike.  Almost constant noise of traffic and dirt and dust make for a long day.  On the plus side are beds, showers, and hot food.  But I'm not sure it is any easier than hiking. Tomorrow on to Las Cruces, we are praying for an west wind and mild weather.  The forecast says rain and cold.  Monday we will rest and recuperate.    "
85,"Filed by John Sunday April 11, 2004 Las Cruces, New Mexico John Stark Left Deming this AM facing a strong cold east wind.  We didn't know at the time that this was the high point of the day.  After about 10 miles it started raining, fortunately I had noticed that at mile 17 there was a store.  Two miles before this store I had a flat tire, I tried pumping it up it up a couple of times, but to no avail, I finally had to resort to walking the last mile or so to the store.  Hail and a thunderstorm with very strong winds descended before I reached the store.  From this time on the weather got much worse.  We finally hitched a ride with two very scary characters into Las Cruces.  I kept my hand on my mace in my pocket the entire time.  One of them claimed to be a former marine, so he and I bonded.  For whatever the reason we disembarked without incident at the Holiday Inn.   Tomorrow the weather is supposed to moderate.  We have had so many flat tires that we are in desperate need of a bike shop to replenish our tube supply.  Most of our tubes have two patches.  We keep picking up these fine pieces of wire that are probably from truck blowouts of retreads.  These pieces are so small that they are difficult to detect.  I found 2 in the tire I changed today.  From now on when the weather looks this bad we will stay put. After that a bike shop and a book store.  There are plenty of sights in the area and several movie theatres.  A day of rest will be much appreciated.  All in all it has been an exciting way to spend Easter. Filed by Dan Any singing today would have been singing in the rain, or hail, or lightning and thunder.  I don't know that I've ever experienced such a range of weather in that short a time span.  John had been right behind me, but the wind was so loud, I never heard him yell that he had a flat tire.  I turned around on our exit, and he was nowhere to be found.  I made it to the store just before the rain turned into a downpour, but poor John was caught in the middle of it.  We were never able to get above 13 mph today.  If it had just been the cold and the wind, we would have be fine, but once we were wet, all bets were off. The employees at the store were great, serving us free coffee and conversation while we lobbied incoming customers for a ride.  One of them would have driven us to Las Cruces, but it is now against company policy since a worker who had done just that (from a different store) was found murdered and his truck stolen.  That wasn't quite what we needed to hear as we were asking every customer with a pickup for a ride.  But despite a little concern, we arrived safe and sound.  The weather is supposed to be nice, but cool tomorrow, then sunny as far as the eye can see - is that like it's all downhill from here??      "
86,"Filed by John Monday April 12, 2004 Las Cruces, New Mexico John Stark Rest day in Las Cruces, feels strange and somewhat unsettling to not be pedaling.  We went to a bike shop where I bought some tubes and a tube repair kit, and a new split bicycle seat.  Have had some suggestions that this might be the way to alleviate my sore butt.  Time will tell.  Had my chain cleaned, it was so dirty that the bike wasn't shifting properly.  Visited a great bookstore, Coas that sells both used and new books.  When you go in they call a guide by intercom to show you to the part of the store you are interested in.  It is a huge maze, a place I could spend several hours in.     At one of those towns with one store that we passed the other day, an old guy came up to me in a motorized wheel chair.  He struggled out of the wheel chair and came over and said, 'I've just got to see that flag.'  On the back of my bike on a flagpole is a 12' by 18' Marine Corps flag.  He touched it reverently, gave me a thumb's up and said 'semper fi, I was in Korea.'  As he hobbled away I thought yeah semper fi. When I was a recruit in Parris Island Marine Corps Depot, I had what I thought at the time was a despotic drill instructor, Staff Sergeant Johnson.  He said, 'When the going gets tough the tough get going.'  This was in 1963; he also said that we might be fighting those folks over in Viet Nam.  None of us recruits in boot camp had ever heard of Viet Nam.  A little over 2 years later I volunteered to go to Viet Nam, thinking at the time that war was romantic and might be a little bit fun.  Never been more wrong in my life.  Since that experience I've found that I don't feel really alive unless times are exciting, tough, and scary.  Maybe that's why this bike trip is oddly satisfying; at times it has all these elements Tomorrow on to El Paso, Texas our fourth and biggest state.  After another 200 miles we will be out of the hills and flat land. Maybe.      Filed by Dan.   Had a great rest day.  The weather was clear, calm and a little cool - one of those ""perfect temperature"" days.  After the bike shop, I went to the campus of New Mexico State University.  I stopped at this great sandwich shop for a pastrami reuben on rye - spicy mustard and all.  As much as I love Mexican food and rice and beans, it was nice to have something a little different.  It's always nice to be on a college campus - I had no idea the age of the average coed is about 14.  Did the rest day shuffle - laundry, relax, catch up with friends, hot tub, explore, and soak up the local culture.  One would think there would be plenty of time for all that on riding days too, but there just isn't.   In the afternoon I rode a few mile to the quaint town of Mesilla, which had many well restored adobe buildings.  The old jail once held Billy the Kid who was awaiting his hanging when he escaped on April 30, 1881.  He avoided capture until July 14, when he was ambushed and killed by Sheriff Pat Garrett.  I'm looking forward to our fourth state, Texas.  Once past Del Rio, a few hundred miles still, the terrain is so flat that our maps no longer have elevation profiles.  Now if we can get the wind to cooperate, the most physically challenging part of the trip will be a wrap.  Stay tuned for a revision to my unfettered optimism.      "
87,"Filed by Dan Tues., April 138 pm Texas has always been looming out there, so large that it will probably take more than 2 weeks to get through it.  Leaving Las Cruces, on route 28, our first stop was the post office in Mesilla, where my third round of mailing stuff home took place.  I always over-pack when I  travel, but in these circumstances, it really makes a difference.  We then cycled through beautiful countryside, laced with pecan groves and onion fields.  Next came the beginning of horse country, with several large thoroughbred farms along the way.  For the first time in a while, I actually had to pay attention to the map, because unlike most of our route thus far, today's route had several turns along the way.         Approaching El Paso, we paralleled the Mexican border for several miles along the Rio Grande.  It isn't the mighty river here that I have in my mind's eye, but its symbolism is powerful.  Entering El Paso, there were long lines of trucks waiting to get over the border with their wares - NAFTA at work.       There's something about immigration here I've never understood.  People come across the border illegally, enduring the most horrible of conditions through rat invested tunnels, in sweltering locked truck trailers, or just braving the cover of darkness with a coyote to whom they've paid a family's fortune.  Yet busloads of Mexicans come over the border legally as day workers, and even to go to casinos for entertainment (if you can call it that).  What is keeping these people from just disappearing into the fabric here, and why would anyone risk so much choosing to come in illegally instead?  The only thing I can think of is that coming in illegally, there would be no record, whereas coming in legally and walking away, you would risk the authorities trying to find you.  But does INS really have the resources to hunt individuals down?  If anyone with a better understanding can shed some light, I would be grateful. I found El Paso to be a pleasant surprise.  Almost no one I spoke with, nor journals I read, had a good thing to say about this city.  But I found the international flavor to be exciting, the markets bustling, and the people friendly.  I know there are bad parts, be we somehow managed to avoid them.  We continued along the border on Delta Drive, which passes the Chamizal National Memorial.  Over the years, the Rio Grande has made several course changes - and without asking permission.  So logical a natural border the river is, if it moved, so did the border.  Many disputes erupted over the years, the most famous being in 1851, when a large course shift in Texas' favor created a large wedge of land called El Chamizal.  The countries bickered over this border change for 60 years before the territory was awarded through arbitration to Mexico.  The US, however, rejected the decision (I guess acting unilaterally again), and held on until 1963 when a review board awarded 436 acres of the area to Mexico, and 193 to Texas.  More than 3000 Americans woke up to find they now lived in Mexico, and had to be relocated. Tomorrow we head off into the vast emptiness of Western Texas.     Tuesday April 13, 2004 El Paso, Texas Filed by John John Stark As we approached El Paso on highway 58, off to our right was a fence with barbed wire on top.  Then as I looked more I realized the Rio Grande was just beyond that then Mexico. It looked like a third world country, poor.  A couple of Mexicans shouted something to us and waved and I waved back.  Along the way we encountered several Border Patrol vehicles, just sitting there watching. It looked like a fairly easy border crossing and the Border Patrol can't catch them all.  When my family and I were in Florida this spring I was informed that smuggling aliens was much more profitable with less risk, than smuggling drugs. Moore asked what do we eat?  If we are in a restaurant I will order some cheap filling breakfast, usually pancakes.  Sometimes the hotel will provide a continental breakfast.  Such was the case in Las Cruces this morning; I had cold cereal, several tiny muffins with jam, toast with some sort of gravy, 5 or 6 cups of juice and lots of coffee.  We didn't eat again until about 2;30 PM, when we stopped at McDonalds.  I had a double cheeseburger $1, chicken sandwich $1, 2 apple pies $1, senior coffee $.27.  My wife Cher describes me as a right hand menu guy.  Usually at the bottom right corner will be a grilled cheese sandwich for about$.89, and I will proclaim I'm not very hungry and order the grilled cheese.  On our first date I said I wasn't very hungry and why didn't we split an order, of course dutch treat.  Cher has mentioned many times that I then proceeded to eat the entire meal.  There is a reasonable explanation for this, too lengthy to go into here.  Some members of my family have described me as cheap; I prefer the more descriptive, frugal.   In the evening I will have a hamburger and several candy bars, striving to keep a proper balance of the food groups.  This evening I even ate some of the lettuce that came with hamburger.  What amazes me is that riding for 6 hours or better a day, good nutrition and my weight doesn't seem to be going down. We have gone about 840 miles and are looking at 1,000 or so miles through Texas.  At this point I want to go in the straightest possible line, in the least amount of time to Florida.  I miss my family and my butt is sore.  Fortunately the weather has been quite nice.  It has been demonstrated to me that we aren't prepared to ride in extreme weather, to dangerous.      "
88,"Filed by John Wednesday April 14, 2004 Fort Thomas, Texas John Stark Slow day getting started from El Paso this morning.  There are a million ways to prolong getting on our bikes in the morning, and today we used several of them.  We walked a mile back to go to Wal-Mart so I could get a camera and Dan wanted an air pump. Success on the camera but nix on the pump.  Fortunately there was a McDonalds on the way back to the motel, I limited myself to 2 sausage egg Mac muffins.  After mounting our bikes, 4 miles east of the motel was another Wal-Mart where Dan got a pump and I a book.  Having exhausted all stalling options we finally started out.        We managed to go a little over 50 miles, and praise the lord it was flat.  Some wind but over the last 40 miles we probably averaged a little over 17 mph.  At a break Dan let me know that tomorrow held some bad news, actually it was much worse than I could have imagined, the dreaded time change.  Even though the time change won't come until we have been riding an hour or so tomorrow, I bit the bullet and changed my watch tonight.   Motels are few and far in between in western Texas. I have become a hardcore negotiator in trying to get rates down.  First I try military, AARP, government, US Boats, AAA, and then I get tough.  I explain we are on a mission of mercy raising money for Habitat for Humanity.  With my voice cracking and tears trickling down my cheeks I pull out the Addison Independent article telling about our trip.  Usually I am dealing with the only motel within 30 miles, these innkeepers wouldn't give their homeless mother a discount.  Today after I had gone thru my shtick, the innkeeper looked at me with beady eyes and said $45 tax not included.  But I protested we never pay over $40 tax included.  We got a beautiful room 2 sinks for only $45 tax not included, grrr.   Tomorrow we are on to Van Horn I-10, which is 58.9 miles by my gps, which only measures straight lines.  I-10 is a little shorter and the hills will be more gradual.       Filed by Dan April 14 10 pm Since it's late and we're getting an early start, I'm off to bed.  Tomorrow beckons.     "
89,"Filed by John Thursday April 15, 2004 Van Horn, Texas John Stark Had 3 flats on the way to Van Horn today.  Just as I had finished changing the last one, along came a pick-up coming from the east on this gravel access road that I had pulled off I-10 to change my tire. It turned out to be a federal fireman from White Sands Missile Base, by the name of Steve Tuckness.  Let me tell you a little about Steve: he had turned around and come back to see if I needed any help.  He persuaded me to accept a ride with him past the construction on I-10.  He turned put to be such a likable cheerful guy I stayed in the car to Van Horn, about 15-20 miles.  I should mention that once the construction was done I didn't suggest he let me out, oh no.  It seems that Steve likes his job, likes his life, and even sees his ex-wife who divorced him because he woke up happy every day.  Think about that for a minute.  My wife Cher says that people like Steve are angels who are put in our path at certain times.  Steve dropped me off at McDonalds and insisted that he buy me a coffee.  While we were there everybody who came in and out of McDonalds he greeted and hoped they would have a grand day.  My day after meeting Steve did a 180-degree turn.  The resentments and irritation at having all these flats and bad luck, just disappeared, poof gone. I'm firmly convinced that god put Steve in my path just when I needed him.          Dan and I agreed on a route to Del Rios and then up to San Antonio.  The more direct route along I-10 saved 80 miles.  The alternate route will allow us to visit San Antonio and stay at Fort Sam Houston, a famous Army base.  Neither of these had been on regular schedule.  We had been scratching about this for a couple of days.  It was meeting Steve and having an attitude readjustment that enabled me to seek a compromise route that suits both of us.  Best of all it is relatively flat, with no day over 90 miles. Filed by Dan Thurs. April 159 pm It was great to get an early start.  I think I had ridden 50 miles today by the time we started out the day before.  We rode along I-10, which for the most part had a wide concrete shoulder that made for speedy riding.  Traffic was a little heavy at times, but was more than offset by the zoom factor.  At one point I was racing a freight train and nearly keeping up.  The fact that I was going as fast as I could, and the train was going slow didn't diminish the return to childhood memories of racing cars on my bike.  Along the way were friendly horn beeps from truckers, and waves and thumbs up signs from construction workers.  We'll be leaving the Interstate tomorrow in favor of a route that gives an approach to San Antonio that sallows us to sidesteps the hill country of Texas.       I stopped at the incredibly helpful Chamber of Commerce in Van Horn to get some route information.  Anyone coming through these parts would do well stopping in.  One of our biggest dilemmas has been choosing a route with motels within a reachable distance, factoring in mileage, wind, weather, and hills.  In fact, our route tomorrow spans 74 miles without a single legitimate town, so we'll have to carry extra food and water.  Within a few days, we shouldn't have to worry about such things as we will be getting into more inhabited country for the rest of the trip.    I finally solved the veggie dilemma.  My concerns weren't helped by an article in the El Paso newspaper about the high incidence of foodborne illness in lettuce, and other vegetables.  I finally bought some canned spinach and a can opener, stuck it in a microwave, and was in macrobiotic heaven.  While hardly gourmet, it tasted great."
90,"Filed by John Friday April 16, 2004 Marfa, Texas John Stark Today was a tough day; we made about 75 miles in 6 1/2 hours, riding 5 of those hours.  I drafted behind Dan the entire day, which made me go faster than my ordinary pace.  We took only 2 breaks, where we got off the bikes, once in Valentine at 38 miles, and 16 miles later halfway to Marfa.  Now I had several stops to pee but I never leave the bike.  Since I have my new digital camera I stand there astraddle the bike getting rid of the morning's coffee.  Passing traffic think I am getting shots of the scenery.  I probably make 6 of these stops in the first 20 miles.  After drinking 4-6 cups of coffee in the morning, it seems I have to make frequent stops.  I don't think it's the coffee; it's probably excess water, so from now I will limit my water intake.    In the town of Valentine where we took our first break, the only building in town that was open was the Post Office.  We were able to get water behind the Post Office from a well.  We took our break at a closed gas station; there was a closed restaurant just up the street. West Texas seems to be a hard place to make a living.  Towns look like ghost towns, with what is there being poor.   This area of the country is flat and sparsely populated.  We climbed most of the day until we were above 4900 feet.  Just imagine this is higher than Mt. Mansfield, and goes on as far as we could see.  For miles we stayed at this level. Of course with a wind in our face, er, in Dan's face, I was tucked in behind.   When we pulled into town I stopped at the first motel and did my usual hardnosed bargaining.  Of course she didn't budge an inch even though the lot was empty.  There were 2 other motels at the second the clerk informed me that because of a motorcycle rally there weren't any rooms for about 50 miles.  Tail between my legs I returned to the Capri Motel.  Unfortunately the empty motel had just rented their last room, my room.  Luckily we went across the street to see about renting an apartment for one night.  No luck, but as we were leaving the motel lady came running out and said she had a cancellation.  We were considering asking the churches if we could sleep on their pews, which would have fit nicely in my price range. Filed by Dan Fri. April 169 pm I get a little apprehensive on these long desolate crossings.  Six hours riding without anywhere to get food and water (we later unexpectedly found water at a small post office) is a little daunting.  But we had just enough traffic and friendly waves to feel that we'd be well taken care of if we ran into any problems.  The empty areas of California, Arizona, and New Mexico had a lawless feel to it - like a haven for crazies wanting to escape civilization.  No so much here.   Speaking of crazies, any readers thinking of doing this trip may want to consider Route 90 from Van Horn, due to the flat terrain, and shorter distance.  The riding surface was great, with a wide shoulder the whole way. At first the town of Marfa had the same ""town stuck in time"" feel to it.  But to my pleasant surprise, it seems to be making a comeback.  There were several art galleries, a great bookstore with FREE high speed internet, and two restaurants where we could have spent John's food budget for an entire week.  The town benefits from being a jumping off point for Big Bend National Park, The Davis Mountains, and the McDonald Observatory.  The classic film, Giant, starring James Dean, Rock Hudson, and Elizabeth Taylor was made here, and the cast and crew were housed at the beautiful, historic Hotel Paisano during filming.  Much memorabilia is displayed in the lobby.  Across the street is the old Opera House, now used as an office space.  When it was built in the early 1900's for $4500, it was the only venue for silent movies between El Paso, and San Antonio - a distance of more than 500 miles.  And to think I complain about having to go to Burlington for the movies.      I used the iPod for the first time, and it was awesome - perfect for this long day.  On today's program was:  Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young - 4 Way Street (the electric side) and Elvis Costello - My Aim is True. Since lodging was so tight due to the weekend Motorcycle Rally, I called ahead to our next stop and got one of the last two rooms in town for Sat. night.  Unfortunately, there aren't phones in the room, so there probably won't be an update tomorrow."
91,"File by John Saturday April 17, 2004 Marathon, Texas John Stark Moore was right when he said beware of people who say it is all downhill, yeah and let me sell you something.  There was a slight uphill to Alpine after 22 miles or so we were told.  We actually managed to hit 5100 feet of elevation.  The next leg to Marathon about 35 miles was very gradual for a while and then, dare I say it, downhill.  In fact it was uphill most of the way with a brutal wind blowing in our face.  The wind was so strong it was difficult to go downhill, when there was downhill.   It is getting to the point where I am able to ignore my sore butt, enflamed nipples, numb sore foot, hip, and mind cramps.  Going 22 to 35 miles without a break is becoming routine.  Pee stops aren't considered resting because I never actually get off the bike.  There are a couple of explanations for these factors; one is that I am getting in great shape mentally and physically, or the second, which I lean toward, is that my entire body is seized by a giant cramp and my mind leaves my body, to reassemble in the evening.  So far I've been lucky and have managed to reconnect, but what if it don't happen?  As you can see this trip has sparked some profound and vigorous brain action.     Tomorrow is again 55-60 miles, of course downhill.  The next day is about 90 miles, guaranteed downhill.  I am sitting outside my motel room with a strong east wind blowing my face; east is the way we wander.  Filed by Dan Sat. April 174 pm For the second day in a row, a had a flat before even leaving the motel.  Better there than on the road.  I had underestimated today's distance by 9 miles, which coupled with swirling winds made things challenging at times.  Our first and only stop was in Alpine, which is a very nice little town.  We saw a lot of motorcycles from the rally, and hung out for a couple of hours.  I needed to refresh my tube supply, so I called the only bike shop in town.  It closed at noon, so we hurried over and met John Elbury, the owner.  Hours vary, so if you're coming through, call ahead.  He has a very nice little shop that can handle most repairs and flat tire issues.  And if you're having sanity issues, he's also a clinician in the mental health field.  During the grey months of winter, bike shop business slows down, but he does a brisk business counseling people.  In the sunny months, the reverse is true.  He was an all around good guy.     On we went to Marathon, and our waiting room at the Marathon Motel and RV Park.  It is a very cool little place with a nice restaurant, an outdoor fire pit and gathering area where tonight they have live guitar music, and a few rustic cabins.  Our room is so small that it can barely fit the small bed and roll away, let alone our bikes.  But it has everything we need, and a beautiful setting to boot. The town, while very small, is very sophisticated.  There are several galleries, a bookstore, restaurants with interesting menus for a change, and a bakery/coffee shop with internet, which is where I am filing this from since our room has no phone.  I can't put my finger on it, but this place has a very content feel.  For dinner we had some great Texas BBQ at a local restaurant.  Later, I was sitting in the lobby of the Gage Hotel thumbing through a book of photographs by local photographer, James Evans, when I came across one of Judy, The Burro Lady.  She was the subject of pictures John and I took.  She's well known around these parts, and just drifts about crossing these long expanses on her burro.  The photographer had on several occasions asked permission to photograph her, and she had always refused.  But one time she agreed.  He later showed her two 11"" x 14"" images he had taken of her, which she said were ""nice"".  He tried to give them to her, but she refused.  Initially he was hurt, but then realized, what would she do with them?       Somehow we've managed to ride over 300 miles in Texas and have yet to see an armadillo or an oil rig, although I did see a tarantula.  But we still have 400 miles to go.     "
92,"Filed by John Sunday April 18, 2004 Sanderson, Texas Today was supposed to be downhill all the way from Marathon to Sanderson, and it was after about 30 miles of uphill.  It was about 55 miles point to point with nothing in between.  The wind was in our faces the entire way, so even when we did hit the elusive downhill, it was like we were pedaling uphill.  The countryside is spectacularly beautiful, with wild flowers everywhere.  Everything is green, a birder's paradise with the little critters chirping along the way.  West Texas has already received its annual rainfall.  We were told at a restaurant that this is the best and greenest it has been in 15 years.  Makes you wonder what it is like in a usual year.  Apparently brown is the normal landscape coloration. West Texas is about the size of Wisconsin and there are only 55,000 people in this vast area.  The Spanish have a word for the area, which escapes me, but means desolate, deserted.  We were told that in Alpine one could buy a section of land, one square mile (360 acres) for $8,000.  Just south of Alpine one can buy 5 acres for $450.  In Sanderson where we are bedding down, people just left their houses and moved away.  In the 55-mile stretch I could count the number of buildings on one hand.  We are traveling Route 90, sort of a secondary road where the speed limit is 75.  Coming into Sanderson, the sign read, 'reduce speed to 65'.        The West Texas people have been a kindly diverse crew, going out of their way to help us.  This afternoon, Mildred Barber, horsewoman, carriage driver from all over, but 'born and raised in Texas,' held court at our table throughout our entire meal.  Advised us where to stay and eat, and when told that we have to go 90 miles tomorrow before a motel, she went out to her truck and tried to give us a tent.  Who would have thunk it?  Oh and she runs the only liquor store in town.   Tomorrow we are going 90 miles before the next motel, in Comstock just outside of Del Rio.  There might be one store, in Langtry, about 60 miles outside Sanderson.  But it's all downhill. Last night at the Gage hotel in hotel in Sanderson I heard a very interesting singer, Craig Carter.  Of course western. Filed by Dan Sunday April 188 pm We went to bed last night with a howling east wind, but in the middle of the night, it stopped like someone closed the window.  So we got on the road early to try to beat it.  In the past several days, it didn't really come up strong until afternoon.  Riding through a mystical fog, the landscape takes on an entirely different character in this different light.  I got in a groove riding so I didn't really stop much along the way, arriving in Sanderson before noon.  It gets hard emotionally seeing these depressed towns and the hard lives people live.  Through it all, they are among the most genuinely friendly people I've met anywhere.     Yesterday, we exceeded 30,000 feet climbing - more than the equivalent of climbing from sea level to the top of Mount Everest.  Happily, it's all downhill from here again.  The last few days, we've been turning up in the same town as a British rider, Dave Telling.  He has done a number of these rides including the Outback of Australia (he assures us that is really remote) and all over Europe.  He goes at his own pace, stopping to bird-watch along the way, and camping when he feels like quitting for the day.  Tonight, he's living in luxury at the next door motel.  I paid him a visit to chat and he insisted on making a donation to Habitat.  He asked me to send his love to his family.  Tomorrow, we'll probably separate for good, leaving us with memories of his good cheer and conversation.   Tomorrow, we likely have our last day in the sparse West Texas countryside.  It will be a long 90 mile ride, and we'll leave early to again try to beat the wind.  Once we hit Del Rio on Tuesday, towns and civilization return.  At the moment I'm looking forward to the change, but I bet there will be days in the future when I'll think longingly of this area.   Most likely, we won't have internet access in Comstock, but we'll update as soon as we can."
93,"Monday April 19, 2004 Del Rio, Texas Today was a tough ride, knowing we had 90 miles to the next town with a motel we left in darkness at 6:30 AM; sunrise is at 7:30.  One hundred yards down the street we got a sign from god, in the form of a lightening bolt.  We heeded this and immediately retreated to the truck stop across from our motel.  These West Texas folks were impressed that we had been spoken to so directly.  One or two thought an open wound or stigmata would have been bona fide.  After telling my tale to a couple of dozen Texans, Shaun Blackmon from outside San Antonio gave us a ride.  Shaun was a wonderful companion, he is a rancher, appraiser (real estate and gemology), and raises exotic chickens.  Being a student of history he told us that the Republic of Texas encompassed several states and went clear to the Canadian border, prior to their joining the Union.  We stopped at a ranch about 50 miles east of Sanderson and several miles off the highway to pick up a trailer load of goats and sheep that were going to auction.  Talk about isolated.  Having been, myself, a dairy farmer in another life, it was enlightening to hear about cattle raising from a real pro.  Shaun had been a partner with another fellow on a 50 thousand acre ranch for several years.  Shaun has a couple other 10,000-acre ranches that he and his wife own.  In Vermont a big farm is 300-500 acres, it is unheard of to have landmasses this size.  The other day I said a section is 360 acres it is actually 640 acres or one square mile.  Can be bought for $8,000 in West Texas.         Tomorrow we will be getting an early start heading toward San Antonio; it is about 150 miles with luck and good weather we might make it in 2 days.  Apparently the land is quite flat for the most of the remainder of our trip, at least it's not downhill. Filed by Dan Mon. April 199:30 pm With 90 miles to the next motel, 56 to the first open store, lightning and pouring rain, and a headwind coming up that would eventually build to 30 mph - and all before dawn - it was with a sense of relief that we embarked on a different sort of adventure.  After an initial sense of relief, I felt a little disappointed  that we weren't able to ride this segment.  But it soon became a part of the journey.  It's funny how these things work out.  If not for this unexpected change in plans, we never would have spent time on a real Texas ranch, nor would we have had the pleasure of getting to know Shaun and the other locals we hung out with while waiting for a ride. The Texans are happy about the amount of rain they've had recently.  They spoke of the drought coming to an end, and when I asked how long the drought's been going on they replied, ""about twenty years.""  It's not just lore.  Time, distance, land, weather, even the people in Texas really are big.       So now we leave the west.  My first experience with the west was on a road trip I took with a high school buddy right after graduation.  Naturally we went low budget, camping the entire way, sometimes eating nothing more than a can of spaghetti-o's, or a potato fried up in a pan for dinner.  I think I took $300 for the six week trip, and that was to pay for 1/2 the gas too.   I came back with $2 in my pocket.  The first time I saw mountains up close I was hooked.  Being an underachiever, I wanted to own one.  As beautiful as the mountains are in Vermont where I now live, the mountains of the west are like no others.

94,"Filed by John Tuesday April 20, 2004 Uvalde, Texas Ferdinand the Bull with a weak bladder is my bike riding style.  Dan is Lance Armstrong, out front and goes from A to B fast.  Today it was supposedly all flat from Del Rio to Uvalde.  On this flat road we had 1600 feet of ascent and 1500 ft of descent.  Rolling hills with a strong wind in our faces for the whole 74 miles.  I'm sure there was far more uphill than my gps showed, these Texans are sneaky.  The TV guy said that the Texas State Capital is 9 feet higher than the US Capital.  I've heard them brag about everything except their educational system.  It was 34 miles to Brackettville and then 40 miles to Uvalde, with no stores in between.  We are still at over a 1,000 feet of elevation, it will be nice to lose that and also that east wind that makes for such slow riding.  It took 6 hours of biking time to make 74 miles.  My moving average was about 12.3 mph and overall average was 8.6 mph, so you can see I took some stops.     Low clouds made for a cool day of bike riding.  Lush vegetation and prolific wildflowers mark this part of Texas.   This has been a wet spring, but the countryside is definitely changing.  I got 74 photos of the sights along the way.  Too many to post using slow Internet service.  Have been taking pictures of the many different ranch signs, some are truly unique.       Most pickups have cattle guards on the front.  Deer jump the fences and feed in the median at night where their only competition is cars.  Shaun who gave us a ride yesterday says he barely slows down for a 150 lb deer, they just bounce off the cattle guard. Tomorrow we are aiming for San Antonio that is at least 75 miles.  We might stay at Lackland Air Force on the southeast or Fort Sam Houston in town on the east. Filed by Dan Tues. April 2010 pm With all the rain they've had in the desert, the cacti are about to explode with flowers.  Unfortunately, we've left the desert about a week too soon.  When you've been in nature's brown hues for so long, the first greens you see are almost overwhelming.  Spring has sprung.  The smells and the feel of the air tell you something is different.     The downside of the terrain change is we've lost the vistas we enjoyed for so long.  We were buffeted by winds again today, but not as bad as the last few days.  Someone told me that the prevailing wind patterns here are caused by geological features that will soon change, resulting in a more southwesterly flow.  I hope that doesn't turn out to be like, ""it's all downhill from here.""  I saw a Border Patrol officer who had stopped a tanker truck, on top of the tank looking in all the hatches for illegals.  We also had to stop for another Border Patrol checkpoint - maybe our last now that we are leaving the border areas of Texas and pushing farther west and north.   There's been a recurring theme where towns seem to be about 40 miles apart.  It's because 40 miles is about one day's horse ride, which of course was how people got around when the towns were founded.  Tomorrow, however, we have 3 towns in a 30 mile stretch.  Yippee!  It's amazing how easily I can be amused. Traffic built throughout the day.  But the truckers always gave us a lot of room, and were again quick with a friendly toot and wave, which made it bearable.  Tomorrow it's on to San Antonio, where they're having a big festival.  I hope to get into town to be a part of it."
95,"Please check back for the latest posting.  Filed by John Wednesday April 21, 2004 San Antonio, Texas John Stark Road had a smooth surface for most of the day and the wind had died down.  Heavy cloud cover kept it cool until we got to San Antonio.  When the road surface is rough as it was for about 10 miles, my hands take a pounding, my gloves were lost 10 days ago, and they gave some protection.  We did almost 84 miles and are just outside Lackland Air Force Base on the south west side of town.  We ate dinner at the officer's club on base, had Hungarian Goulash.  You pick the food and they cook it, I put about 2 pounds of steak on the plate.  When the waiter took a long look at the plate and blanched, I knew they weren't planning on someone like me.         We are planning to go into San Antonio and see the sights on Thursday.  First I plan to go to Lackland and get a good gym workout.  Need some exercise after sitting on that bike all day. Getting out of San Antonio could be a challenge.  We came in on 90 and were going to continue on this road.  The traffic is brutal, we are viewed as something lower than road kill by most drivers.  Texans are used to hitting things, if the number of birds, rabbits, and skunks on the roads are any indication.  There are always buzzards around either feasting or looking for there next meal.  They seem to know when some poor critter is about to expire and start circling.  Toward the end of the day I keep an eye peeled for them, if they appear in numbers it is time to drink some water.  One bird followed me for about 5 miles. Of course the constant nagging thought is that they possibly know my condition better than I do. Filed by Dan Thurs. April 2211 am It's nice just kind of hanging out around the motel for now to catch up with friends and e-mail.  A little later we'll be heading in to the city to catch a little bustle and some events from Fiesta.  We weren't able to get lodging at Lackland Air Force Base as we had hoped, so we're at a Best Western nearby.  We're lucky we arrived mid-week, because there's nothing available for the weekend due to Fiesta.  Tomorrow, we'll have to cross the city, then wind our way to connect back with Adventure Cycling's route near Navasota, TX.  Anyone out there with route info to get us there in bike friendly fashion, please post in the Guestbook. The ride from Uvalde was unremarkable, except that the wind was not a major factor for a change.  US 90 was a nice road to ride on, usually with smooth wide shoulders.  The rough stretches made riding the sweet spot in the traffic lane where cars had worn the surface smooth a necessity, if only for a brief respite.  But because traffic was pretty heavy, I had to keep one eye on the mirror at all times.  Closer to San Antonio, the road became a divided 4 lane highway, with traffic increasing as both San Antonio and rush hour drew closer.     The roadside was full of the smells and sights of spring, with large fields of Black Eyed Susans, Daisies, Texas Blue Bonnets, and beautiful pink flowers whose name seem to escape everyone I ask.  I saw my first armadillo of the trip, but being dead, he wasn't looking especially photogenic.  Better luck next time, both for me and the aardvark.

97,"Filed by John Friday April 23, 2004 Seguin, Texas John Stark Late start this morning, it was raining and roads were slippery.  Where we were on the southwest side of San Antonio was heavy traffic and no place to ride a bike.  We did what any red-blooded adventurer would do; we hopped a city bus to downtown.  This whole week is fiesta and today there were 2 parades, we kept wending our way back and forth across the parade route.  We visited the Alamo and McDonalds and headed out of town.  I'm not sure Texans would approve of these two places in the same sentence.  Finally got that famous battle cry, 'remember the Alamo' figured out.  This battle cry came when Sam Houston won the definitive battle ensuring Texas's freedom from Mexico.  Texas was so proud of Sam Houston that when he was governor during the civil war and didn't want to secede; the legislature fired him and then Texas joined the confederacy.                  It is muggier and hotter in this part of Texas.  For at least the past 4 days there has been heavy cloud cover.  I'm being spoiled, not sure if we will be able to ride on sunny days.  Don't have to worry about tomorrow; rain is forecast and that familiar southeast wind that has been with us for most of the trip.  Being halfway there is a huge boost, being that much closer to my family and home.  Some days it is a temptation to catch a ride and get this bear over with.  In the morning I will get up and practice, 'one day at a time.'  Sometimes on the bike I am practicing one minute at a time.  I have a little portable radio music gadget that I have listened to a couple of times.  It has been too distracting, occasionally I ask myself distracting from what? We are much stronger, and tomorrow should be a productive day if the gods of wind, hills, and flat tires co-operate."
98,"Filed by John Saturday April 24, 2004 La Grange, Texas In the mornings before we start I have been doing Pilates that keeps me limber, and Transcendental Meditation that keeps me sanguine.  My Pilate's instructor Nina in Middlebury, VT was going to supply me with new routines.  She and her assistant Jennifer have said that with all this effort, I now have the body of a defeated 70 year old.  But with perseverance, there is still hope for me.  For the first 30 miles on I-10 it was new road surface and no wind, heaven on earth, we averaged over 16 mph.  Out of nowhere came a strong headwind that cut my time in half.  Still managed to go 57 miles by noon to Flatonia where there was a McDonalds.  Checking my tires I had 3 pieces of wire in my rear tire and 2 pieces of glass in my front.  Removed all and amazingly my tires still have air.  Cutting back on dessert, I managed to avoid the 2 apple pies that I have been having 2 or 3 times a day.  My seat will have to be expanded to accommodate all this junk food.  Possibly this is nature's way of getting rid of my sore butt, pad it with good old-fashioned fat.       After lunch we decided to get off I-10 and take 609 north, nice back road with lots of hills and even more wind.  This was 20 miles to La Grange, a tough 20 miles.  Ended up doing about 80 miles, now we have to figure out where to go next.  If we hit another road like 609 it will almost double our time.     Tomorrow is yet to be decided, storms are still a distinct possibility and winds a certainty. Filed by Dan Sat. April, 248:30 pm Today started with ominous clouds, and the guarantee by local TV weather forecasts of rain all day.  So packing included putting everything in ziplock or plastic garbage bags, making sure the computer was safely sealed in the dry bag, and leaving rain gear easy to get at.  Despite the cloud cover, it looked like we may have a little opening, so leaving early may mean one hour out of five without rain.  Riding in the rain really isn't that bad unless it's also cold, which it had been earlier in the trip.  Your normal run of the mill rainfall, as opposed to a wind driven downpour, can actually be quite nice - sometimes refreshing, sometimes mystical.  So I was prepared both mentally and physically for the rain.  Of course, with each passing hour, things grew less threatening, until in the afternoon, we actually had sunshine - the first we've had during riding hours for days.  One of the great things about a trip like this is that you have no idea how each day will turn out, and trying to predict only serves to show how out of one's control things really are.   Just as unexpected as the dry day, so too was the strong wind.  As we started to bear Northeast (a new direction for us) the wind started to come from --- the Northeast! (a new direction for the wind).  Mother Nature sure have a creative sense of humor. After battling the wind a while, my brother-in-law Tim called as I was beginning a rest break.  He was driving a truck from Los Angeles to Florida, and was on I-10 a few hundred mile behind us.  Half jokingly, he asked if we wanted a ride.  Half jokingly, I said no.     We must have passed through half a dozen towns today.  It's really nice to now have the option of going farther, or cutting the day as we see fit.   Anecdote:  Yesterday I had the first incident of a dog (two actually) chasing me.  Nothing serious - a little yell to stop, and a squirt from the water bottle did the trick.  Since I was ahead of John a ways, I called and left a message on his cell phone to alert him.  Today while we were at McDonalds, the cell system delivered the message. On to tomorrow, whatever it may bring."
99,"Filed by John Sunday April 25, 2004 Brenham, Texas Have been working on healthful eating, in an effort to get more vegetable intake I had only onion rings for lunch.  For supper chicken tenders from Wal-Mart and for the all important whole grain and fruit, oatmeal with raisin cookies.  My meals at McDonalds are generally lacking in vegetables, for the necessary balance I sit next to Dan who generally has a salad.  This is known as the proximity factor, I feel as sated as though I just had a carrot juice cocktail.  My double cheeseburgers are complimented with 2 apple pies.  During the day slim Jims provide protein and the necessary fats and extra sodium.  Some have wondered how I can eat such a wholesome diet and be concerned with weight gain.  Probably on the days when I will have 4 apple pies and 2 cherry pies, the two fruits don't compliment each other and there is some binding of the fat molecules.  As with is true with all revolutionary diets there is probably some fine-tuning that needs to be done.  After that, look out America, for the John Stark on the road lean machine healthy eating diet.      Enough about food.  The weather was rainy, windy, with thunder and lightening.  At one point the lightening was striking within a couple of hundred yards from me.  After considering stopping, I thought to myself people in cars don't get hit by lightening, and I have rubber tires, just like a car.  Therefore I should be safe.  At the moment of this bit of incisive thinking a stray bolt of lightening hit right next to me. This caused me to reconsider my original hypothesis, I started thinking my tires are skinny and close to the ground, and I don't recall seeing cyclists in thunder and lightening storms.   Maybe this isn't safe!  I'm sure somebody out there has the answer to this perplexing question, hopefully before the next electrical storm. Tomorrow we plan to go to Conroe, about 61 miles.  Today we thought we would get to Navasota but the weather and hills defeated us.  We went just under 50 miles, but believe me it seemed much farther.  We didn't arrive in Brenham today until 5:00 PM and it would have been at 7:30 if we had pressed on. Met Mike Wagener, a Brenham local and a peach of a guy.  Very positive outlook, builds computers and has climbed Mt Rainier.  See his picture.  Also Helen and Ken Sutton who we met in a restaurant this morning, had a nice chat with Ken about biking.     In answer to Moore's questions; no I haven't tried Texas catheter, and I am definitely in another state, physically and mentally.  And what was the third? Filed by Dan Sun. April 2510 pm It was raining right from the start today.  We waited around until 10 hoping to catch a slot between storms to ride in, and we did.  For about 40 minutes.  And 10 minutes after it started raining, I was just as wet as if we hadn't waited at all.  Really, the worst part of the day was sitting around trying to ""time"" things right.  When the rain was lighter than a downpour, it was quite pleasant.  It wasn't cold, so it was easier to focus of the sights and smells of spring.  After about 20 miles, the first stop was Round Top.  I hadn't seen John for a while, so I called and left a message that there were places to get out of the rain.  He'll probably get the message sometime tomorrow.  Round Top seems to be a destination on the Texas Blue Bonnet Trail, a designated scenic route that Houstonians travel in droves for a Sunday drive to escape the city.  Even on this rainy day, there were 20 people waiting outside some trendy restaurant, waiting for it to open at noon.  The population of Round Top is listed as 76, but I think there were more houses and antique shops than that.       After a light bite, the rain let up, and we set off on a route suggested to us by a wet motorcyclist coming from a Harley gathering.  Guaranteed to save 10 miles, he assured us.  In the end we were grateful it was only a mile or two longer than our original route.  I took us on a pretty, winding, up and down little road, barely wide enough for two cars to pass, speed limit 60 mph.  Thankfully, the only car we saw was when we were unsure which way to go at a junction, and someone happened upon us to steered us the right way.  The remaining 10 miles into Brenham were pretty tough, with 20 mph headwinds punctuated with one rolling hill after another.  It's amazing how we can climb almost 2000 feet in a day, and end up at almost the exact same elevation.  As it was getting late, we chose to stop for the day in Brenham, a luxury unavailable to us just a few days ago.   Tomorrow, we'll try for Conroe - about 65 miles, after which, we've been assured, it's perfectly flat."
100,"Filed by John Monday April 26, 2004 Conroe, Texas John McKoy of Oregon wrote that lightening, which is high voltage, travels around the hard shell of a car, in the case of a bicyclist, what you get is chicken fricassee or something like that.  Apparently I was fortunate that I wasn't struck by lightening, people have accused me of being hardheaded maybe that had something to do with it.  Regardless I think the next lightening storm I will sit out, not under a tree.     We went from Brenham to Navasota this morning a hilly, windy ride.  While having lunch at McDonalds on our way to Conroe, one of the employees told us there was maybe 2 hills we would confront and then it would be flat.  A shudder passed through me when I heard this, I tried to pretend I hadn't heard, but it was to late the curse was set.  Even after spitting over my right shoulder and spinning around 6 times in an attempt to mitigate the curse, much to the amusement of the McDonald employees and customers.  It was much worse than I feared, of course the hills were there, however the curse at least doubled the wind we were riding into.        In Texas they have this quaint practice of pass and swerve.  The front car will up observe a car coming up behind him and he will swerve into the breakdown lane.  The passing car will swing around in a pass.  This seems to be an automatic reaction, the swerving car doesn't look, and the passing car doesn't look.  Since the passing car sometimes straddles the centerline the only one who seems to notice this maneuver is the oncoming driver.  Generally they clutch their hand to their heart while their eyes cross convulsively, I'm sure this is great business for the local hospital emergency rooms.  The person who was telling me about this told me it is legal, he said they lose several bikers a year in this manner, sort of a cost benefit analysis.  Considering that it is at least a misdemeanor to travel less than 85 mph on Texas roadways, it is wonder more aren't lost.   Tomorrow looks like a long hard day, in other words another average day. Filed by Dan Mon. April 2610 pm Just a long tough day - no other way to describe it.  The wind alone would be enough, but taken with the hills, it added up to a tiring day.  Spent it almost entirely on the drop handlebars.  We got started later than normal, and the distance was longer than we anticipated, so we finished late, too.  I think Texas Fatigue has settled in.  By the time we escape in a couple days, almost half our riding days will have been in Texas.  OK, enough whining.  Tomorrow is another day.      "
101,"Filed by John Tuesday April 27, 2004 Liberty, Texas We are staying in Liberty, Texas after a day of flat roads and mostly smooth highway.  It doesn't get much better than that on the bicycle.  Almost 65 miles, a quarter of the effort that it took yesterday.  Liberty Rose Stark-Rinder is my 13 going on 14-year-old daughter. She is the apple of my eye, could there ever be a girl this smart, twice as shiny as a new penny, good and kind, as the day is long?  I don't think so.  And here we are staying in a town of her namesake.  I'm sure she will be tickled pink to see herself mentioned in this journal.     We were chatting with 2 women at our 2nd out of 3 McDonalds and one of the women, April remarked she has identical twin 10-year-old girls.  Co-incidentally I have twin identical 10-year-old girls, Ali Lovette and Glory Bianca.  All that I said about Liberty applies to these 2 girls.  I happened to mention that I have 11 children, Laura said, 'You must like adventure to be on this trip and have all those children.'  April said, 'Heck no honey he just likes sex.' Blushing furiously I vainly tried to protest, amid their gales of laughter.   Tomorrow should be our last day in Texas.  Then we will travel the southern route of Louisiana, right on the gulf.  I have always been curious about this area of the country I have read many James Lee Burke novels about this area, a dark mysterious area it is. Filed by Dan Tues. April 279:30 pm We intended to get on the road early - at least we left the motel by 7:30.  But there being no breakfast at this motel, we had to stop along the way at McDonald's.  There we met Steve & Sherry.  Steve's dad was an avid cyclist, having done many long tours, including a cross country tour on a route similar to ours.  We had been stumped about how to cross Louisiana, so Steve rang has dad up right on his cell phone for some pointers.  So when we officially got on the road, it was after 9:00.   Continuing on Route 105 to Cleveland, we finally did something we hadn't done in days - 15 mph.  The road was flat, and the wind, while not a tailwind, wasn't much of a factor.  What a boost it was.  In Cleveland we met at McDonalds where we had to make a route decision.  John's wife, Cher, who had been on the phone with the road gods in some government office in Louisiana, patched John in on a three way call, and the decision was made.  We would take the southern route, crossing into Louisiana after Port Arthur, and bike along the Louisiana Gulf Coast.  Having been warned away from the heartland of Louisiana as  ""Deliverance Country"", and having already been looked up and down a little too closely a couple of times, who was I to argue?     I want to put a rest to some vicious rumors - we are not receiving any appearance money from McDonalds, not that we wouldn't take it if offered. So just east of Cleveland, we headed south on Route 321 to Liberty.  After a couple of miles with rough roads, we hit a newly paved section, and with the wind a bit more behind us, it was clear sailing the rest of the way.  Perfectly flat, signs for Boiled Crawfish, Fried Catfish and Etoufee announced that we we're nearing a new region.

102,"Filed by Dan Wed. April 289 pm When you're riding into a headwind, you get advance notice of upcoming roadkill.  And there is a lot of roadkill.  It's quite a system really.  Texas drivers drive fast, hitting critters crossing the road slowly, providing food for the buzzards, which often become roadkill themselves.  The authorities have their hands tied, unable to lower speed limits to a safe level for fear of upsetting this delicate ecosystem. Today's ride was blissfully flat.  The winds however, were back in full force.  Rumors that I proposed turning back toward California just to catch a tailwind, however, are somewhat exaggerated.Home stye cafe Fannett texas.jpg We followed Route 90 out of Liberty to the tiny town of Nome.  What started as a short rest stop and bathroom break at the convenience store (and only store in town) turned into an hour of chatting with the locals filing in after stopping to pick up their mail at the post office across the street.  If we were still riding the Adventure Cycling Route, the likes of us would be commonplace.  Here, we're celebrities, albeit crazy ones.     Just past Nome we left 90 for Texas 365, a pleasant 2 lane road with no shoulder, but light traffic.  We cut through the low country heading toward sea level.  We're starting to see herons, and turtles, and yes, more dead armadillos.  (Is that the plural of armadillo?)  With 20 miles to go, we stopped for lunch Fannett at The Home Style Cafe.  John had Chicken n' Dumplings, Cheesy Potatoes, and a homemade cinnamon roll, and I had chicken and sausage gumbo - all homemade, of course.  We've begun asking directions just as conversation starters - we usually take our leave about an hour later.  I really like the pace of days like today.     The drivers, like the landscape, are changing character.  I think drivers see us akin to gnats buzzing about their heads, and their role as drivers, to swat at us.  Nothing dangerous yet, just something to pay attention to.     The next few days will be along the Louisiana Gulf Coast, and low country.  I can't wait!  "
103,"Filed by Dan Thurs. April 299:30 pm We finally got a tailwind today.  It was leaving Port Arthur, and taking a highway cloverleaf entrance.  Of course since it was a full circle, we were bound to get a tailwind somewhere along the 360 degrees.  After that, we were back to headwinds.  Actually, the wind being SSE was more a crosswind to our easterly direction, and long stretches had wild bamboo growing, which acted as somewhat of a windbreak.       The ride today was simply beautiful through largely undeveloped seashore and marsh on a quiet, smooth backroad.  And of course totally flat - for real!  Anyone planning this trip using Adventure Cycling's route may want to consider this alternative.  It's lightly travelled, and the road was great, as opposed to the rough roads on Adventure Cycling's route through Louisiana that people complain so much about.   It's alligator mating season, many people have warned.  I have this fast forward movie playing in my head with me, having interrupted an alligator in mid-mate, being chased down the highway while I squirt him with water from my water bottle - not the most effective deterrent to a water-borne animal. We are staying in Cameron, which looks like an out-take from Forrest Gump, with shrimp boats and vendors everywhere you look.  I think the Spanish word for shrimp is Camerones, which would explain the town's name.  There is a lot of helicopter traffic here, as people are shuttled to and from the offshore oil rigs, some over 100 miles away.    With the Louisiana drivers, we're back to friendly waves, and wide passage - so far.    We've been cautioned ti won't last.  My Brother-in-law Bob, his wife Teri, and my niece Suzy and twin nephews Ryan and Garrett live in Lake Charles, about 30 miles away, and made the drive down to meet me for dinner.  Thanks guys, I had a great time! Tomorrow should be a long day, but 1/3 of it will be to the Northeast, which should provide a partial break from the wind. Filed by John Thursday April 29, 2004 Cameron, Louisiana Finally left Texas this morning, started at Port Arthur and went south and then east along route 82, which is the along the coast of Louisiana.  What a beautiful ride, a birder's paradise, the whole way. When we got to Holly Beach we spent several miles right on the ocean, absolutely beautiful.  Still a strong wind in our faces, feels like we are climbing a hill all day.  I have found that if I don't fight the wind and just go with the flow it is much easier; some would say that this is a metaphor for life.  Everybody has been so helpful along our trip, the acts of kindness have become routine.  Yesterday Terrell Wousley gave us his cell phone number and his address in Louisiana if we wanted to stop and sleep on his screened porch.  Today along the coast 2 men turned around and inquired if I needed help, apparently I most have looked sort of desperate, normal enough look for me from about noon on.    We were warned about the bull alligators along the road in Holly Beach, they are quite aggressive during the mating season.  This will be a great chance for a photo opportunity, camera in one hand and Halt in the other.  Halt stops dogs not so sure of gaters, would be nice to have that info before I am faced with a charging bull, if the spray fails I plan to place my helmet in his mouth, removing my head first.  As a last resort my bike will be used to buy me a little time, unfortunately I haven't had the opportunity to put this plan into action.     Tomorrow we will continue along the coast, there isn't any more lodging for about 120 miles.  We might have to resort to plan B, if you wonder what plan B is you are not alone, we don't have a clue either. With this persistent wind 60 miles seems like a long day, about what we covered today.  The common advice was to travel from west to east because the prevailing wind was from the west.  Talked to a woman today she said the winds in this area come from south, north, east, never the west.   We welcome your comments.  Feel free to post a message to us using the Guestbook.

104,"Filed by Dan Friday, April 309 pm I was soaked all day.  Though not overly hot, the air had the kind of humidity that takes your breath away when you venture outside from air conditioning.  I like the heat, however, so I found it very pleasant. Continuing along route 82, the road was like our own personal parkway, crossing through lush low country with wildlife everywhere.  Fish jumping, turtles ambling, birds nesting, frogs croaking, and gators lurking, unfortunately, out of our sight.       I had spent the first 55 miles keenly aware that the road, then headed east and buffeted with a strong crosswind, would then turn due north, giving us a tailwind that dreams are made of.  Except the wind shifted to the east, so we had more of the same for 30 more miles.  The last 10 were straight into that east wind, making for the hardest riding of the trip.  When I would feel tired, I thought of the 70 year old men who had passed through Cameron recently on bikes.  After crossing the country west to east, they were now headed back the other way. At a convenience store rest stop in Pecan Island we met Betty, an all around good egg.  She told us of a friend who had walked into her house and moved a piece of cardboard designed to keep mice out, only to discover a very poisonous Cottonmouth Snake.  She ran to get a shovel to kill it, but when she returned, the snake had vanished into some unknown nook or cranny in the house.  She's doing what any sensible person would do - she's moving out.  Betty usually just shoots them when she sees them.  ""God put them on the earth for target practice.""   At another stop, I was asking a woman route information.  She couldn't understand a word I was saying, nor could I understand her.  We had to bring a third party in to figure everything out, and I later discovered that she didn't know  what she was talking about - not uncommon in these parts when seeking directions. It's been a long, satisfying day.   I think it's time to give in to sleep. Filed by John Friday April 30, 2004 Abbeville, Louisiana John Stark 96.5 miles longest day to date, but not that tough a day.  Left Cameron this morning with thunderstorms threatening, never materialized even had brief sunshine.  It is an oppressive heat down here, when we remark on this people say 'oh it's spring this is beautiful weather' I'm not sure I would care to be here in the summertime.  The last 15 miles today were into the strongest wind we have encountered; several times I thought the wind was going to blow me over.  Little children skipped by us like we were standing still, we practically were.  Birds again flew over us most of the day, truly a birder's paradise.  No luck with getting a picture of an alligator, apparently they like the sun, and there hasn't been much of that.  There have been a couple of dead frogs in the roadway; they must measure close to 2 feet long.   Nighttime is when they come out, word has it they are more dangerous than alligators.  Several of them jumped in the water as I rode by, sounded like someone had thrown a stick of dynamite, the wave of water drenched me.  Good thing we aren't doing any night riding, it would be like getting hit by a kamikaze pilot, I'm not sure if they are man-eaters.   Last year I went 150 miles on the Appalachian Trail with my friend Moore, he went the whole way to Maine from Georgia.  He had this book of pilgrimages that he would read to me from time to time.  A quote he sent a few days ago said, 'Prepare for everything, and expect nothing.' Now the way I had remembered it and the way I prepared for this pilgrimage was just the opposite, needless to say preparing for nothing and expecting everything has led to some unusual outcomes.      Tomorrow we will stay on the southern route through New Iberia; within 2 days we should hit New Orleans.  Getting closer!"
105,"Filed by Dan Sat. May 110 pm We awoke to Louisiana thunderstorms, and a forecast for more throughout the day.  The skies cleared, at least for the moment, and we set off.  All of the riding today was on US 90, a busy, mostly 4 lane road with shoulders of varying quality.  At times, the shoulder was full of random drops of asphalt, as if the paving machine had a runny nose.  And I've never seen so much road debris.  Nails, construction materials, car parts, wire, whole pieces of paneling - you name it.  Given fairly uninteresting scenery, it at least gave something to focus on.  We may have a couple more days of this riding until we get back on a coast road.  The wind was our invisible foe again - mostly a crosswind.  I just take it as a given, and push through it with the hope that with each passing weather system, it may turn in our favor.  In spots where there are at least some trees to act as a windblock, you can pick up 2 mph in riding speed.  For now, you just take what you get.       Just before finishing for the day, I had a flat on a busy interstate bridge.  It was too dangerous to fix there - thankfully the motel was just a 1/2 mile walk.  Ten minutes after arriving, it started to storm, and it's still raining 7 hours later.  Talk about grateful.   Louisiana Anecdotes - Theirs is not a low fat diet.  As Joe Pesci says in ""My Cousin Vinne"", have yas heard about the growing cholesterol problem down here?  I can't even find so much as 2% milk, let alone, lo-fat.  You get the feeling that what they do serve is ""fat fortified."" Being called sir by someone 10 years older than I is getting unnerving.  Do I really look that tired by the end of the day.  I guess it's better than being called maam.   Today's Music:  Lyle Lovett - Pontiac; Joni Mitchell - Hejira Filed by John Saturday May 1, 2004 Morgan City, Louisiana Did about 68 miles today with the constant wind making for a long day.  Met a couple of nice people today Ed Domingues owner of Eddies One Stop in Erath, LA.  Also Liza Robinson front desk at Best Western who was Morgan City Employee of the Year.  She is currently working to become a physical therapist.     Tomorrow on to almost New Orleans, town called Westwego.  It has been raining hard for several hours; fortunately it waited until we got checked in.  The forecast says it is supposed to be sunny.  "
106,"Filed by John Sunday May 2, 2004 Boutte, Louisiana My sister-in-law Ro who lives in Madrid has expressed concern over my hygiene and safety, not to worry.  I have one pair of biking pants and a biking shirt that I wash on a daily basis, sort of; they take a shower with me.  In Texas these used to dry over night now they are always damp, but since we are bathed in sweat all day this doesn't seem like much of an inconvenience.  My socks are all black, I'm never quite sure if I am wearing clean or dirty socks.  My clothes for the evening are a black t-shirt and light khaki shorts both synthetic, I washed these once.  The t-shirt never seems to get dirty or smell, the shorts take on sort of a camouflage configuration.  Since we are always in a different place nobody notices what I am wearing.  Ro asked about my undies, but undies are so bourgeois, no place for them on a cross county adventure.    Today was record setting, I had 5 flat tires one of which was a blowout, and my tire was ruined.  As I came out of the motel office after checking in my tire was flat for the 5th time.  There has been so much debris on the road; hopefully they are better in Mississippi, which we should hit tomorrow.  Everybody has been very kind in Louisiana, today at our 68th   or so McDonalds Sheri Opal of Houma, LA noticed my Marine Corps flag and came out and donated to Habitat for Humanity.  On the highway I had just finished using my last spare tube and a former marine stopped and offered me a lift, it was very tempting, as soon as he left I regretted my decision turning down the ride.  Never again will I take a motorized vehicle for granted.   It was a cool overcast day and I did about 65 miles.  Even though I thought it was damp and cool apparently a couple of Louisiana men thought I looked overheated.  They slung what looked like a 2 quart cup of ice and soda into my back going about 80 miles an hour.  The force of this almost sent me into the ditch if it had hit my head I might have been knocked out.  They didn't bother to stop so I could give them a special thank you.  Tonight my clothes needed cleaning, everything is all sticky, I guess those folks weren't drinking diet coke. Tomorrow on to New Orleans, new tubes and tires, some of my tubes have 5 patches on them.  Worse than that I am out of patches.     Filed by Dan Sun. May 210 pm Saw my first alligator.  It was roadkill - on a bridge no less.  Now how an alligator got there, I have no idea.  To get there on its own, it would have had to climb one of the pillars supporting the bridge, crawled laterally upside down, hoisted himself over the guard rail on onto the road surface.  Do these things want to mate or what?!   Half of the miles we rode today must have been on bridges.  Through the bayou, they can stretch for miles before the road touches firm ground.  They are only about 10 feet above the swamp, but provide great viewing of the plant and wildlife.  This region is uniquely beautiful.      A gentleman we met at lunch said the road is so full of debris because of all the scrap metal trucks passing through.  Sounds believable.  Other than that, the most exciting thing that happened was a bee mistook me for a big yellow flower and was trying to pollinate me. We can add a new dangerous saying to the lexicon.  ""After you leave Louisiana, the roads are all good"" takes its place in our collection along with: The wind almost never blows from the east. Tomorrow, it will be cooler. Tomorrow it will be warmer. Tomorrow the rain will end. It's just ahead, not very far at all. It's not very spicy - (a Texas favorite). This shortcut will save you 10 miles - guaranteed. and of course, It's all downhill from here. Tomorrow, we should pass 2000 miles on our way through The Big Easy.  We are in desperate need of tubes, tires and patch kits, so we'll hunt down a bike shop while in town.  We're told we can get across the mighty Mississippi on a ferry, which will be fun.  Then to the smooth roads of ""anywhere but here."""
107,"Filed by Dan Mon. May 37 pm What an adventure today was.  We had a nice tailwind and were cruising along when the road debris won out, and blew a pinkie size hole in the sidewall of my tire.  I had the brilliant idea a few weeks back that surely I won't need another tire for the balance of the trip, so I didn't buy one the last time I had a chance way back in Las Cruces.  Well, you can't put a new tube in a tire with a hole that big in it, or else the tube will do a bubble gum imitation, blowing a bubble through the tire wall, which then explodes sending anyone nearby diving for cover.  This I know this firsthand.  We were also out of patches, so I went to a gas station and bought a tire patch kit and radiator hose tape, put a patch inside and outside the tire, wrapped it with the tape, and set out on a wing and a prayer, hoping it would hold 9 miles to the bike shop.  It did.   A great guy, Greg LaCaze, owner of The Pedal Shop, set us up with new tires, tubes, and directions for getting through the city.  IF you're coming through this area, check him out.  People for the last 200 miles have been warning us to be very careful in New Orleans, and Greg was no exception.  We passed through a whole range of neighborhoods on our journey to the Mississippi.   The river crossing on the ferry was a delight, emptying us right onto Canal Street and in to the French Quarter.  We pedaled lazily, taking in the city's rich tapestry - the sights, the smells, and the sounds, as live jazz poured out of almost every restaurant in the quarter.  And this was noon on a Monday.       We had to move along to stay in front of rush hour, and headed east toward our next state - Mississippi.  Along the way I had a machine to man encounter with a car.  I really don't remember exactly what happened, but I ended up spilled out on the nice plush grassy boulevard, adrenalin rushing, but unhurt and thankful.  Police Officer Ernest Cortez who witnessed it came over to help,  and asked if there was anything we needed.  I said directions.  I told him where we were headed to find a motel, but he warned us away to a better neighborhood.  We had a nice chat, and he gave us his card with instructions to call him if we needed anything.  Another great person encounter.    After checking into the motel, I ventured out to a nearby convenience store in search of a Mississippi map, only to find a sign, ""Temporarily Closed"" on the window.  They had just been robbed.  So after a quick dinner, I'm back to the safety of the hotel.  I think I'll stay in for the night. Filed by John Monday May 3, 2004 New Orleans, Louisiana Left Boutte this morning and a beautiful morning it was.  Maybe unusual for around here no clouds sunny day and about 75 degrees, first nice day we have seen in about 10 days.  Managed to make 10 or 15 miles before Dan had a blowout, fortunately it was only a few steps from our second home, McDonalds.  Awash in coffee we headed off for the Pedal Shop in Bretna.  Greg, the owner is a super guy, most friendly bike shop we have run into on our trip.  I bought 4 tubes and 2 foldable tires for $57, so one can see his prices are reasonable as well.  Greg drew us detailed maps to get to the ferry and how to navigate New Orleans.  The ferry was a great experience, crossing the Mississippi, what a wild turbulent river.  Any type of ride is welcomed, I hated to leave the ferry, and it was only when they threatened to bring out the dogs that I reluctantly disembarked.  So far I have gone through 3 tires on this trip and have bought 3 new ones.  Tubes and patch kits I haven't kept track of.  At home a flat was a rare occurrence and it never dawned on me to fix a tube, I just bought a new one.  Now instead of doing my nails in the evening I am filling up the sink to check for leaks in tubes and patching them. We are staying at the La Quinta on the east side of New Orleans, we were warned that we were heading into a very dangerous area and then there were no motels for 40 miles or so.  We have gone through several areas that I wouldn't care to go through at night.  At Motel 6 I met the most enthusiastic and positive person of this trip, Decarla.  She is president of her evangelical society.  There is a picture of her and her fellow worker Angel.     Today was a short day; going through New Orleans especially the French Quarter took a lot of time.  The house in the French Quarter are unique, hopefully some of the pictures we took of them will do justice to their New Orleans flavor.  Tomorrow on to Mississippi, I know I said that yesterday, but tomorrow we will make up some time for the easy day we had today, 40 miles."
108,"Filed by John Tuesday May 4, 2004 Gulfport, Mississippi Two beautiful days in a row, I don't think I can stand it.  My brother Ben, an engineer who turned 61 yesterday estimated that I have a flat at least every 100 miles.  Yesterday no flats, today almost at the end I had a rear flat.  Now when this happens there are no tears or curses, just a quick and businesslike tire change, well maybe at the end of the day there are a few blue words.  This reminds me of when I was a dairy farmer and I would be milking my cows when one of their manure-laden tails would swing around and catch me the face.  At first when this happened I would leap up in indignation that the cow had personally and maliciously struck me, with time I could wipe my face shrug it off and continue milking.  You are probably wondering how does this poor booby get off comparing milking cows and changing tires, a very good question.      We are staying in Gulfport, maybe a little to the west of town within walking distance of the Grand Casino.  We are staying at a Days Inn on the 3rd floor facing the ocean.  Circumstances have turned me into a hard bargainer.  Started out that price was $65 for a back room, ended up with ocean view for $45.  Shortly after getting in Mississippi we have been riding on the ocean and it is truly gorgeous, the view, smell of the ocean, and a great day weather-wise are a combination that is difficult to beat.  Tomorrow looks like more of the same, riding along the ocean and beautiful weather.  Later in the week it is supposed to get up in the mid 80s, a little warm for bike riding but it beats the alternative.  My mother said she had snow this morning in Westford, VT and my wife Cher said it was cold in Middlebury, VT this morning.  Probably the folks in VT don't want to hear about us riding along white beaches on the shores of the Gulf of Mexico, or complaining it might get in the mid 80s.  When I went out for dinner it was cool enough for a light long sleeved shirt.  Ah that's enough about the weather.  Tomorrow Alabama.  Only 2 McDonalds today, will work at getting back to the average 4 a day by tomorrow.     Filed by Dan Tues. May 49 pm Today was just one of those special days.  We quickly escaped New Orleans for the serenity of the backwater wildlife preserves of southeastern Louisiana.  When we were just about to leave Louisiana, I came up behind what must be the state's only street sweeper.  I thought, ""well that's why this road has been so free of debris.""  However, once in front of it the road was equally clean.  Go figure.  Maybe the roads of Louisiana were too much for this lonely machine, and it was trying to flee to the friendlier pavement of Mississippi.      Leaving behind the challenges of bad roads, headwinds, hills, and weather, today almost felt like cheating.  Light winds, beautiful scenery and a mostly smooth road made for near effortless riding.  At one point I was crossing a long bridge with water all around me and one of the great feel good songs of all time playing - Walkin' Slow by Jackson Browne.  It didn't seem like it could get any better.  Later it did.  Two Harley riders from Missouri gave me a hot tip as to the whereabouts of an alligator sunning himself in the bayou.  It was the first chance I had to catch a glimpse of one without paying.   We rode for miles along the white sand beaches of the Gulf Shore, and arrived at today's destination, Gulfport, Mississippi.  After checking in I walked along the beach toward the sunset.  As twilight fell, I headed back only to find the full moon rising out of the Gulf, showing off the same orange hues as it rose as did the sun when it set.  I've never seen anything like it.  Sigh...    "
109,"Filed by Dan Wed. May 57 pm I wish I could send some of this sunshine back to everyone in Vermont.  The last couple days have been one beach town after another - Bay St. Louis, Pass Christian, Long Beach, Gulfport, Biloxi, Ocean Springs, Gautier, Pascagoula.  Though the roads have been busy, the scenery more than made up for it.      I had no idea what a big deal gambling is here.  A couple of the casinos look to be almost Vegas-sized.    A few years ago, on one of my first trips out east, I asked a Toll Booth operator on the Garden State Parkway if this was the right way to the coast.  He looked at me like I was from another planet.  Finally, he said, ""you mean the shoa??""  Today, as I was nearing Alabama, I asked how far it was to the border.  They looked at me like I must have meant Mexico.  Finally, they connected the dots, ""Oh, the stateline!""  I think people are aware that I'm not from around here.   Entering Alabama, The Indigo Girls, ""Southland in the Springtime"" playing in my ears, the scenery was lush, the road smooth, the air oozed spring.   Amazing that over 2100 miles into the trip, riding can still have these perfect moments.  I arrived at tonight's destination, early for a change, in Bayou La Batre, a tidy little town with a working fishing port.  Tomorrow we wind our way down to Dauphin Island, so named by Louis XIV, after one of his court's explorers landed there in 1699.  Lot's of sand, sun and history in store.     Filed by John Wednesday May 5, 2004 Bayou La Batre, Alabama Started in Gulfport, MS and traveled 68 miles to Bayou La Batre, 7 of those miles were spent trying to find my lost bicycle mirror, but no luck.  Another beautiful day, probably a little warm later on in the afternoon, not complaining just presenting the facts.  Traveled on the water to Biloxi then away from the water to here.  Missed not having a shoulder on the road the drivers sometimes come much to close for comfort.   Met John McKee in Ocean Springs, MS, he and his wife are transplanted from the Boston Area.  John is an enthusiastic guy and an impassioned cyclist, he races mainly triathlons.  He will be racing in Panama City, FL this weekend; we might be there about the same time John is racing.  There is a picture of John outside his clinic.  Another cyclist that I met just outside of Ocean Springs was Robert a former Marine,  He had a cart that he was pulling and that he was collecting bottles in;  he said in the last 2 weeks he had made $100.  He drove his bike to Idaho, camping out, recently and has over 5300 miles on this bicycle.  Two very different guys, both enthusiastic, friendly, and loved their bicycles.

    This was a day without flats, 2 McDonalds, 2 pies, and a McChicken sandwich, and of course many senior coffees.  All in all a fine day! Tomorrow we will be heading into Florida, we will get to take a ferry before we cross the state line.  It is so exciting to get on a ferry and have someone else move us.  We might make Pensacola Naval Air Station where I will try to get a room in the bachelor officer quarters (boq)."
110,"Filed by Dan Thurs. May 69 pm It wasn't until today that I really allowed myself to think of the end of the trip.  As I was trying to get a phone number, a woman was showing me a U.S. area code map, and for the first time I saw how far we've really come.  Now I find myself slowing down, on the one hand not wanting the trip to end; on the other, I miss my wife Judy, and family and friends.  I miss our dog Greta. and the comforts of home.  This kind of travel takes you out of that comfort zone, and hopefully expands it.  It broadens your horizons and challenges you to enjoy life in the moment, not just in the rear view mirror.  It's not easy, but that's part of the point.  You return with a greater range of experience, and hopefully a more accepting view of the world around you.  I have my Judy to thank for the travel bug.  Her love of travel was passed down to her by her grandmother and her father, and now through to me.  I have no doubt that I would have remained in ""my comfort zone"", if not for her enthusiasm for leaving it.  Thanks sweetie. So today's ride was one of mixed emotions, and again, of great beauty.  Our route took us down through pristine bayou on the way to the ferry at Dauphin Island.  With historic forts, beautiful scenery, plentiful white sand beaches, and the ferry to points east, it looks to be a great place to visit for a different type of vacation.  The ferry was a pure delight, with nothing to do for 40 minutes but take off my shoes, work on my tan lines, and enjoy the scenery.       After, we rode 20 miles through the Bon Secour National Wildlife Refuge, with pine forest bordering uninterrupted stretches of white sand beach.  I had to slow down, not wanting it to end.  Traffic and development increased as we left Alabama and entered Florida.  Hopefully, once through Pensacola, they will lighten up a bit.     Filed by John Thursday May 6, 2004 Pensacola, Florida John Stark I could get used to these flat roads, it has started to fade in my mind, all those hills.  Today did 78 miles even though 4 of those miles were on a ferry.  Riding along the coast is wonderful, the wind and air in my face. Today was a lot of dunes that blocked the actual view of the gulf, but it still is exhilarating to be so close to salt water.  The weather was once again gorgeous no clouds temp 88 by 4 PM.  I realize that I will have to start earlier in the morning to beat the heat.  After riding the ferry and riding along the Alabama coast I was amazed at how built up the shore is.  In Louisiana and Mississippi there was still a lot of single-family dwellings and it looked like ocean front property was still reasonable.  In Alabama as far as the eye can see are high-rise buildings.  Of course Florida has more of the same.  From here on we will be on the coast through Panama City, Port St Joe, Apalachicola, around Lanark Village we will leave the coast.       Went the whole day without a McDonalds, never saw one.  After I crossed into Florida on Perdido Key I saw a Burger King, now I had seen a couple of Burger Kings earlier in the day when I was fresher and had more resistance.  But 2:30 in afternoon, no breakfast, a Cliff Bar for a snack, and in a moment of weakness I found myself at the counter of Burger King ordering 2 Junior Whoppers and of course a senior coffee.  I sat in the back away from an exit and quickly devoured my meal, not bad actually.  I slunk out the side door hoping that one of the McDonald mind control police wouldn't be cruising by to report me and revoke my membership in the senior coffee club.  I want to publicly state for the record that this was an aberration and that tomorrow and forever I will be back at McDonalds.  My son Alex who is in the Coast Guard, questioned how I could be going through such a rich area of the country for food diversity, and for god's sake eat at McDonalds? There was certain validity to his question, my response quieted him, but do they have senior coffee?  I'm sure this confirmed what he has long suspected, terminal dementia on my part.    On the ferry ride to Dauphin Island had an interesting chat with a retired Methodist Minister Bill Holmes and his wife Nancy.  In Gulf Shores I stopped for directions at a fish shop and Joe was so agreeable and helpful that I had to get his picture."
111,"Filed by John Friday, May 7, 2004 Fort Walton Beach, Florida We planned on going to Laguna Beach today which would have been 80 miles, a respectable day.  However I stopped in Fort Walton at the tourist information service to ask directions, and they informed me that after Destin the next town 4 miles away there were no more motels until Panama City.  Prices are very high in this area, after calling several and becoming more discouraged, I noticed a rundown motel across the street called the Greenwood Motel, they had a room and it was in my price range, those of you that know me realize that this must be one cheap motel, indeed.  We got a room with a balcony overlooking the bay, about 50 feet from the water. The view is absolutely spectacular, by far the best room we have had yet.  What all this means is that we can't afford to dawdle for the next 6 days. My plane is leaving Orlando at 6:30 AM a week from tomorrow; it is time to go home.  I miss my wife Cher and girls, Ali, Glory, and Liberty.     This morning as I was riding along I was talking to Cher about our minister's recommendation; Johanna Nichols suggested that I lay my hands on my tires and say a Unitarian Universalist blessing, when asked what that would be she said that I would think of something, whatever comes to mind.  Three days ago I grabbed those tires with both hands and felt the force, or something like that. Lo and behold no flats for the next 2 days.  So this morning I asked Cher if I should do this every day or if once was sufficient?  After hanging up I had a flat tire.  Upon repairing this flat I grasped those tires with the fervor borne of desperation, I reflected mightily on a blessing or two.  Three times I grabbed those tires, a woman walking by gave me a wide berth and showed me her mace, perhaps the moaning and gnashing of my teeth and her thinking I was speaking in tongues caused her some concern.  Too little too late, I was to have 2 more flats before the day was out.  I'm not exactly sure what it is that I am doing wrong, perhaps I said the words in the wrong order, or not loud enough, tomorrow I will work a little harder.  At McDonalds they told me that I would have to go outside to have my senior coffee, my carrying ons were frightening the other customers.  To bolster this blessing, not that I don't have faith, I bought 2 more tubes today.     The weather has continued to be beautiful, and Dan said that tomorrow we are supposed to have a following wind; inadvertently he may have cursed us much like when people would say it's all downhill.   Filed by Dan Friday, May 79:30 pm Flat tires and lack of motels further down the road conspired to keep our day a little short.  Leaving behind the morning traffic of Pensacola, while crossing a toll bridge I left the bike lane to ask at the booth if I had to pay. ""If you don't get back on the bike path you do"", he admonished.  He really took his job too seriously.

  I then turned on to scenic Hwy. 399 through The Gulf Islands National Seashore - 15 miles of the most incredible beach I've ever seen.  Completely undeveloped, yet accessible for all beach-goers, I biked on a brand new, paved bike path with pristine sand dunes on my left, and the turquoise waters of the gulf on my right.  Though it seemed to go on forever, even a bike's relaxed pace brought it to an end too soon.  I would urge anyone coming through to visit this national treasure.     The route rejoined US 98 for the remainder of today's ride, with traffic building as it got later in the day.  Hopefully, traffic on Saturday and Sunday mornings will be more agreeable.  "
112,"Sat. May 810 pm What is it about the ocean at sunrise that makes people want to do stretching exercises.  I don't stretch in the morning at home.  But there I was at sunrise on the beach looking like some maharishi.  It's probably good for me - regardless, it was a pretty special way to start the day.   Out of Fort Walton Beach, we had no choice but to stay on US 98, which had a lot of traffic even at 7 am.  My worries that the whole day would be like that were unfounded, when we turned on to route 30A, which stays along the ocean, and has a dedicated bike path.  A lot of other bikers had the same idea - weekend warriors, escaping for their Saturday ride.  Nearly the entire route had housing on both sides, but peeks through to the gulf still made for a nice ride.  At one point, I rode through a roadblock - the local high school cheerleading team selling Krispie Kreme donuts for a fundraiser.  I had to muster every bit of willpower to keep riding, nearly turning to go back when they yelled, ""good source of energy - you look a little tired.""    The route passed through Seaside, one of those perfect planned communities, with perfect houses and landscaping, and probably a thick rulebook.  I stopped for a quick snack, but left quickly fearing my helmet hair would force an association meeting to be called.   This road emptied out in Panama City Beach, a beach resort town with a decidedly spring break feel.  For miles, mini-golf, water parks, beach paraphernalia,  batting cages, go-cart tracks, and the like.  Talk about over-stimulation.  And high season hadn't even started yet.  Finally, I was spit out of that scene onto another beach road, and past the finishing area for a 1/2 ironman triathlon where they stragglers were coming in.  I think that is a 2 or 3 mile swim, 50 mile bike ride, and a 13 mile run.  Seeing how they looked made my fatigue seem meaningless.  Then on through Panama City, a dreary place, and onto the beautiful grounds of Tyndall Air Force Base, with its huge pine trees, and beautiful waterfront.  Tomorrow is probably our last day on the water, until the Atlantic! Filed by John Saturday May 8, 2004 Tyndall Air Force Base, Florida Did almost 80 miles today, what with the heat and the spring break atmosphere in Panama Beach.  This beach went on for about 10 miles, constant development, only a couple of open spaces to the gulf and condos were being up at a wondrous rate.  Florida has said yes to the developers in a big way, at this rate there won't be any shore land left.  Traffic was heavy and constant, not always shoulders, which made for a stressful ride at times.     I want to thank John McKee for his donation to Habitat for Humanity.  John raced in a half iron man in Panama Beach today.  We came through town just as the stragglers were finishing up.  I'm sure John finished high in his age group; he probably finished high in the total standings.  The heat was in the upper eighties so the race must have been brutal.  When I checked in at Tyndall AFB, I said I needed 2 beds, the clerk said she would have to give us a suite, and they were $37.50, was that OK?  Yees, we have a living room, 2 bedrooms stocked refrigerator and snacks, and by the way no tax on the room.  The base is beautiful, right on the water, with beautiful landscaping.  We had dinner at the dining facility, great food, great prices; I could give up McDonalds for this.   Today was much better for flat tires; I only had 2, yesterday 3, working toward progress not perfection."
113,"Filed by John Sunday May 9, 2004 Carrabelle, Florida It was a tough morning I had to go to Port St Joe, 25 miles, to my first McDonalds.  Here I met Jerry Warren, a large guy, take a look at his picture, he and I could pass for identical twins.  We both have almost identical physiques I gave him a few tips on how he could bulk up to look like me. In chatting with Jerry I found out he grew up in Youngstown, Ohio.  According to him he was a gang member, had a pair of 45 pistols, a fighting machine.  He went on to become a professional heavy weight boxer for the next 9 years.  He now lives in Cape San Blas and has his own construction company employing 42 people.  He is solidly middle class, knows everybody in town, and acknowledges that he his is one lucky guy to have escaped his background.  Had a great conversation with him, set me up for the day.    Made it 81 miles today, took the scenic route down by Jerry's neighborhood, added 6 miles, this will be my last scenic route. In Apalachicola went right by Burger King, just didn't see it.  Ended up eating fresh grouper, not bad, may have to cut out one McDonalds a day and eat in a regular restaurant.   Want to wish Cher and my mom happy Mother's Day, to bad I can't be there in person.  Also congratulations to my son Abbott who graduated from Champlain College yesterday with a degree in accounting.  Depending on our day I should be home on Saturday at the latest.  It is difficult to look beyond the days riding, messes up my concentration. Tomorrow we should be in Perry. Filed by Dan Sun., May 910 pm Had heavy legs this morning.  It happens sometimes, and it almost feels like you're riding on flat tires.  It may be because this was our 17th consecutive day riding (more than 1100 miles since San Antonio) without a rest day.  Also, urban riding in busy traffic like we had much of yesterday really wipes you out mentally.  Your senses must be acutely aware of your surroundings constantly, watching for traffic ahead, behind, to the side, in your mirror, watching the road for obstacles, glass, potholes, sewer grates.  Not much time for sightseeing.  It is truly exhausting.  So it was fitting that our first 15 miles today were along a parkway lined with high pine trees, where US 98 passes through the rest of Tyndall Air Force Base on its way to Mexico Beach.  Here we found a quaint, less commercial beach town, with handsome houses, where every cross street ends at the Gulf.    For the next 25 miles, the wind made its presence known once again.  I guess I did curse us a couple days back when I mentioned that tailwinds were expected.  This stretch ended at Apalachicola, a beautiful little fishing village, with some stately old homes and fun shops.  A friend posted a message to us that 80% of Florida's, and 10% of the U.S. oyster supply comes from right here.  The remainder of today's ride was again right along the Gulf, with mostly undeveloped shoreline.  A nice way to end the day.     I mentioned flats tires earlier, and neither of us had one today.  I can't remember when that last happened.  However, I did have an interesting wildlife encounter.  I was riding merrily along when I spotted what I thought was some tire tread, or piece of radiator hose in my path.  I eased over to avoid it, and noticed it was moving. It was actually a dark snake, I'd say about 6 feet long if you straightened it out.  It was trying to cross the road, and just as I came upon it, a car came from behind, scaring it right back into my path.  I nearly jumped clear off my bike.  Somehow I got by, but the fate of the snake is unknown.  There are quite a few poisonous snakes down here, and some are pretty aggressive.  I'm told that this one probably wasn't the poisonous variety, but I felt lucky nonetheless."
114,"Filed by Dan Mon. May 108:30 pm We really can't catch a break with the wind.  It has now become such a part of our experience, that I don't even check the forecast any more.  Thankfully, it wasn't especially strong. The first 20 miles today were through forests of tall cedar trees, on flat straight roads, with a nice shoulder.  So were the next 20 miles, the next 20, and the last 25.  The scenery was pretty for a while, but a little variation would have been nice.   Not surprising then, that along with forests, came logging trucks.  If they passed you going your direction, you got a welcome pull in their slipstream, but if they passed against you, it would stand you up and knock your speed down by 3 mph.  Occasionally, a truck carrying fresh cedar bark mulch would go by, leaving behind the most intense cloud of pine scent which would linger for a mile.  Most of the trucks gave us plenty of room.  But four or five times, I had to get off my bike and off the road because an oncoming truck chose to pass right in front of me.  The sight of one of those behemoths bearing down on you at 70 mph is pretty scary.  Every time I stop and talk to someone, they close the conversation with, ""well, just be careful.""  In the interest of blissful ignorance, I never asked why.  Perhaps this is what they meant. My biggest accident of the trip happened yesterday.  I had a small bottle of chlorine bleach that I use to sanitize my water bottles.  Apparently, on a rough stretch of road, the bottle sprung a leak.  I had it in a ziplock bag, but that had worn through, so the bleach soaked through my panniers onto my favorite t-shirt.  I can't remember, is tie-dye in again?  Well if that's the worst of it, I have a lot to be grateful for.   Filed by John Monday May 10, 2004 Perry, Florida Ohhh is my butt sore, did 87 miles today with the wind in my face.  No matter which direction I went in it seemed like the wind would turn with me.  This has been my toughest day, not sure if it is the heat or the time change or a combination of factors.  The air is different once you get away from the coast, much heavier, like swimming through whipped cream.  Our route from Carrabelle long on miles and short on towns.  A couple of towns that I went through had nothing to show that you were going through a town, not even a house.  Didn't hit my first McDonalds until we got into Perry.  There is even a Super Wal-Mart.    We are debating whether to make it to St Augustine in 2 or 3 days.  A large part of this will depend on the weather, rain and wind.  Either way I will be flying out on Friday or Saturday.  "
115,"Filed by Dan Tues. May 1110:00 pm So tonight's the last night of the ritual.  Finding a motel, and getting off the bikes.  John showers and meditates; Dan explores our new home.  While I'm out, John will write his entry and prepare the his photos from the day.  Somewhere in there comes dinner.  We patch tubes, check tires, oil our chains, maybe do some laundry, check e-mail and see if there were any new guestbook entries.  Later in the evening, I will prepare my photos.  I'll upload John's entry and the blank template into which I enter the day's mileage and other statistics.  I caption the photos and upload them individually - with a dial up connection, it can take up to 3 minutes each.  While they're uploading, I'll write my entry.  Once it's put to bed, it's time to put myself to bed.  First a little pre-packing for morning, a little reading, then lights out.  Such has been our lives for almost 7 weeks.  I don't know how it will be tomorrow, but it will be different.  Maybe that's why I'm writing so late, perhaps lingering with what had become a comfortable friend.  Even if I don't get much sleep, I know tomorrow I could ride on adrenaline alone. Today began like most days, with me folding my map to show the day's route in my map holder.  But there was one notable difference - the rest of the trip all the way to St. Augustine fit in the window!  What a thrill that was.  We then phoned the local authorities to determine the best route to take.  We opted for US 98 out of Perry - a few miles longer, but with promises, later fulfilled, that it would be a better and safer road.  Again, the wind was in our faces.  Imagine being on an exercise bike where the resistance level is 2 or 3 notches above your comfort zone.  That's what riding into a 15 mph wind feels like.  Crossing the fabled Suwannee River, we began a 13 mile stretch that was the scariest section of road I've ever ridden on.  Much like yesterday's road, narrow with truck traffic and 60 mph speed limits, this stretch also had absolutely no shoulder.  The other route would have had even more of this kind of road, so this was still the best option.  With 17 miles to go, the road became divided highway with ample shoulders all the way to Gainesville.  Entering the city, there were even a few hills thrown in to remind us where we came from.  When Stephen C. Foster wrote this song, he spelled it Swanee rather than the correct, Suwannee, because he didn't want people mispronouncing it.  We're staying at a Holiday in on the University of Florida campus, with a high speed wireless internet connection, a McDonald's next door to keep John happy, and a Krispie Kreme across the street for me.  Does it get any better?       Filed by John Tuesday May 11, 2004 Gainesville, Florida Woowe if my butt was sore yesterday, today it went to a new dimension, the rear dimension.  It was a 96 mile day from Perry to Gainesville, but nowhere as near as challenging physically as yesterday.  Today I had plenty of sleep, limited my coffee, and drank copious amounts of water.  It was much hotter today with a strong headwind.  The roads were generally excellent, with one 15-mile stretch with no shoulder.  As we were coming through Gainesville just before the hotel we climbed a steep hill, I had so much difficulty climbing the hill that I was convinced that I had a flat tire, the only thing that was flat was my energy level. The amount of debris in the highway is amazing; I almost picked up a beautiful pair of scissors.  This morning I saw this stunning cane lying on the shoulder, it was very shiny, vibrant orange and black.  As I got closer I noticed that it was an unusually thick cane, in the next instant I noticed it was a snake, fortunately no traffic was behind me as I lurched into the traffic lane.  If I hadn't been so unnerved I would have gotten a picture of the snake, if he were deceased, maybe next time.     Now that the trip is one day from completion, I am starting to get a routine that will keep the pain to a minimum.  After 25 or 30 miles I will take a break, then breaks every 10 or 15 miles for the remainder of the day.  Of course plenty of water and food at our favorite stopping place McDonalds.  Being such a quick study it has only take me 7 weeks to come up with this routine, one day before the end of the trip.  Tomorrow, our last day, let me say that again, our last day will be another long day in the high 80's, but it will be our last day! "
116,"Filed by Dan Friday May 146 am I'm sitting outside at the beautiful Casa Monica Hotel in St. Augustine having a  good cup of coffee for a change as I write this.  The sun isn't yet up, and the air is thick with humidity.  After 48 days on the road, and 43 riding days, we arrived Wednesday afternoon to the cheers of my wife Judy and a handful of friends.  We had ridden the last 1,387 miles and 20 days all the way from San Antonio without a rest day, which probably wasn't the best thing for our bodies, but like they say, you have to make hay when the sun shines, and that whole stretch was without rain. We chose to end the trip at the amazing beach at Anastasia State Park.  The adventure Cycling route ends at US 1 and King St. in St. Augustine, which is a very anti-climactic red light intersection in a busy part of town.  For an extra three miles and a buck, if you follow King Street across the Bridge of Lions in the heart of St. Augustine and look for the lighthouse and signs for the State Park, you'll be rewarded with a serene one mile ride past the park gate to a beautiful white sand beach, and the Atlantic inviting you in.  There are showers and restrooms at the end of the road, and Island Joe's at the beach which has a convenience store, and a snack bar that serves a grouper sandwich that made the whole trip worthwhile.  Their fare is anything but standard beach food, and it's worth it to plan for a meal there.  There is also a picturesque campground in the state park, just a stone's throw from the beach. My wife Judy, publishes a tourism map in St. Augustine, as well as our hometown of Middlebury Vermont, so I've spent a great deal of time accompanying her down here on business trips.  The entire trip I had the picture of that beach etched in my mind, riding the final, peaceful mile.  In fact, the day we started our trip, she was in St. Augustine and we talked by cell phone as she was sitting on that very beach.  I had gotten a little misty the last few days thinking about the trip's end, but it wasn't until now as I write that the tears really started to come.  Time to go in for another napkin. Our last day started like most for the last few weeks, with a tough 15 mph headwind.  Heading due east almost the entire day, there wasn't any chance that a change in our direction would bail us out.  Slogging out these miles, you become a bit of a student of the wind.  One thing I've noticed is that on a windy day riding along tree lined straightaways, when we approached a curve, the wind always seemed to pick up.  Is there some law of aerodynamics that would account for this, or is it just coincidence and/or my imagination?       Following route 20 out of Gainesville, the first 11 miles were on a pleasant highway with ample shoulders.  But the next 50+ were on two lane shoulderless roads with a fair amount of traffic, much of it under construction.  It is incredibly noisy riding into this kind of headwind, so today's ride was anything but the peaceful slow roll to the finish line I had hoped for. We rode gently rolling terrain through Central Florida horse country to Palatka, crossed the St. John's River, then turned on to State Highway 207 to Hastings and Spuds, the self proclaimed potato chip capital of the world.      Veering right onto route 206, I counted down - nine miles to I-95, two more  to US 1, and finally, four to A1A, and the first glimpse of the Atlantic.    There we took A1A north, finishing the last 7 miles barely pedaling courtesy of that same wind that had been our nemesis for so long.  A well deserved way to end the trip.  Smiling all the way, we rode past the gate of the State Park and into the waiting arms of loved ones.

     So I'm off the bike, and taking a couple days of R and R before heading home Saturday.  John flew out this morning, back to the rolling spring green hills of Vermont.  It's great to be out of the saddle for now, but I'm already thinking about where the next trip will be.  I doubt it will be anything as ambitious, but anything can happen.     Throughout the trip, we took many deviations from Adventure Cycling's route.   From San Antonio on, we essentially created our own route.  Some decisions were good, others not so good.  We checked with local police and highway patrol departments for road conditions and traffic.  We asked a lot of people for directions and distances, and mostly got inaccurate, but well intentioned advice.  However, the experience of interacting with the locals made the quality of the advice unimportant.  Inevitably, our inquiries were the beginning of nice conversations.  Because we ventured off on our own, we certainly missed  some great scenery, but we saw New Orleans, The Gulf Shore National Seashore, the unspoiled Louisiana Gulf Coast, and countless other sights that we would have missed if we had stuck to the route.  All along the way I tried to live by the creed, ""It's the journey, not the destination.""  I would encourage anyone contemplating this, or any type of trip, not be afraid to make your own way.  The only way you'll miss is by not trying at all.    "
