15,"As for where we will be each night, that is up in the air.  We are on vacation, so this is no race for us.  I'm pretty sure we will be starting very slow heading up the MTS and then will pick up speed as the land gets flatter and our thighs get thicker.

21,"   The 10 mile ride from Oceanside was really beautiful.  The last 2 days were also nice, but this darn fog is really putting a damper on enjoying the beautiful views.  Also, haveto note a TON of race cyclists out here - wow.  RC and I look slow as slugs next to these guys. Stuck in Encinitas when we realize that RC's bike was way to squirely with only rear paniers and his fork couldn't take a front rack.  Much bike shop shopping later, RC ops for the trailer.  Much laziness also holds us in comfortable Encinitas.  Leaving SF was super stressful for me, I did not leave myself enough time before quitting my job and getting on AmTrak to get stuff done.  Encinitas offers a nice comfy place to make final adjustments and get my life in order. Ok, its now Tuesday night - 1 weeks since we left SF and we are going to start heading East tomorrow and will begin using our Adventure Cycling maps.  I'm excited!  This past week was more just prep and meeting up with old friends.  Now the adventure really begins.   Yup, I'm having bacon for breakfast tomorrow!   "

24,"More talk of CATMAN at breakfast.  guess the guy claims to be a shamen priest and is going to grow a tail next. Long ride today up and down at the top of these MTS but then a looong way down into the dessert.    The ride was great - to come out from all the MTS to see the desert floor way below us and then ride down all that way.  Wow. Stopped in Ocitillo, which really is nothing.  A hotel w 4 rooms, a few RV parks, 1 restaurant, and a small grocery - this is a sign of things to come?   Luckly we stayed w John Jackson at his ""Adult"" RV park.  Ok, nothing scetchy here, that just means he don't want kids around.  He let us stay for free since we were crazy enough to bike accross the country.   Super nice friendly guy - again a sign of the future? Hot as a !@#$ in the dessert, we felt the hot air

25,"For those of you who may not know...Sonya and I have left for our cross country bicycle adventure.  She's got a website up and sometimes running at http://www.crazyguyonabike.com/doc/sonyaman Check it out.  More updates to come.  Here's my little summary of events so far.   day1.  left Santa Monica for a 49.5 mile ride to Huntington beach,CA.  Many thanks to Diedra and Richie for putting us up for a couple of nights and making sure I started the trip with a wee bit of a hangover.  Fortunately I was feeling a bit better than Rich who had to go to work that morning looking a paler shade than normal.  Ride was great though it was foggy all the way to hunnington.  Turns out we would have mostly foggy weather till we left Encinitas and headed east.  but oh, do we miss the beach and the cool weather.  We stayed at a hotel in Huntington as therer were no campsites to be found.  The next day it was on to Encinitas, or so we thought.  The day turned out to be 60 miles and we stayed in Oceanside.  Some crazy driver nearly hit Sonya and then gave her the finger afterward.  Not too nice.  but mostly the drivers have been real nice.  Encinitas was only another 10 miles but it was begining to get dark so we stopped.  Did ride through Fort something or other on the way.  The tank crossing signs were quite entertaining.  Fortunately we saw none.   Next morning's ride to Encinitas was beautiful.  nice road.  Nice shoulder.  Lots of people out for run/walks and the ocean was filled with surfers.  In Encinitas we stayed with Meredith and George Hermann.  Two of our former housemates from college who are now married!  Many thanks to Meredith and George for putting us up much longer than was expected.  Sonya and I had some bike modifications to make and found things always take longer than expected.  I ditched the rear panieers for a Yakama trailer.  It makes the bike much less squirely.  So after 4 nights or so in Encinitas, and a birthday dinner with Meredith, we headed south to San Diego and turned east.  First night out we stayed in Lakeside, CA.  It was a 54.8 mile ride the final 10 miles or so were up hill.  Signs of things to come.  We got a great campsite on the lake for 2 bucks that night.   Next day we did a measly27.2 miles.  But it was up hill.  and steep!  Thank god for San Francisco!!!  This steep was nothing compared to Fillmore street.  The training rides we did weekends in the bay area really paid off.  In total I think we were on the bikes for 5 hours plus.  Not a fast average but not bad considering the climb.  We went from about 900feet to just over 4,000.  There was no camping in Pine Valley, CA so we stayed in the hotel there for the night.  If you're not doing anything on June 12th, tune into VH1.  I think we're going to be on TV.  We were the only to people one of the two restaurants in town when the film crew rolled up.  They were filming some sort of documentry on extreme lifestyles and they were profiling Catman.  A native of the area.  This guy is a real freak.  He's got his face and arms in a cat like tatoos, he's had modification to his lips, cheeks and teeth to make him 'catlike'.  It was interesting.  They taped us getting our reactions and then did a little interview with us.   Oh, and if you do get a chance to see the show, could someone tape it for me?  I've got a wedding to go to that night.  Naomi and Bryan are going to tie the know!  Congrats you two, Sonya and I can't wait. This is where my notes get a little sketchy.  The next day we ride I think to Live Oak Springs.  Sun is finally out all day after leaving the coast and it's strong up in the mountains.  We're going through sunscreen like it's water.  If anyone knows how we can get a sponsorship from Coppertone let me know, would you?  We're going through about a bottle a week!   Oh, Live oak springs is a snack break.  we're staying in Octillio tonight.  It's named after the Octillio cactus which is abundant in the area.  the last 10 miles into Octillio are all down hill on Interstate 10 with a 8% grade.  Unfortunately my trailer has an 18 mph max speed limit on it.  Otherwise...I probably would have killed myself going down this mountain.  Jack Johnson, who runs the RV park we are staing at in Octillio later tells us that a woman broke her collar bone riding down the mountain a few months ago.  When we get to Octillio we call the two RV places for camping.  One is 10 $ and turns out to be discustingly filthy.  The other is called Hideen Pleasures Desert Adult RV park and when I call about availability the guy tells us we can stay for free.  We're a bit sceptical as nothing is free and we're wondering what an 'adult' rv park really is in the middle of the desert.  But the place we checked out is so bad we give it a try.  We pull up there after riding the last 2 miles on a dirt road and I'm waiting for naked people running all around the place.  No such luck!  it's an adult rv park cause the propritor doesn't like putting up with kids.  Says he's raised enough of his own and doesn't want to have to raise anyone elses.  Jack tells us that if we're crazy enough to bike across the country the least he can do is put us up for free!  We get the residents airconditioned lounge for the night.  all the ice we can want and a great, clean bathroom and shower.  He keeps asking Sonya how many times her mother dropped her on her head when she was little that would be the reason for her doing this.  But he did tell me I had myself a nice girlfriend with me.  Said the last couple who came through the guy was about my size and his 6'3 250lbs + girlfriend was 'big enough to kill bear with a switch'.  I said thanks I guess. It's been getting real hot.  But that's the desert for you I guess.  We woke up in Octillio around 5:30.  Grab breakfast at the dinner and ride on out to blythe.  We get into town around 12:30.  Mostly down hill.  Maybe about 40-50 miles.  I forget.  Up pulls a cyclist on his road bike doing a saturday morning ride.  Sonya and I are bordering on miserable due to the heat but I put on my happy face and chat with Carter as he rides alongside next to me.  Offers us a place to camp for free in the city.  Turns out to be on the lawn of the Baptist church he belongs to.  But it's free, they have showers and we can get off the bikes.  So we take it.  little do we know it's going to lead us to attending service the next day, asking if we've been born again in Christ and the weather hitting an amazing 118 degrees in the sun.  Sure, it's only 103 in the shade, but there are no trees to offer shade in the desert.  But I'll get to that next email.  This one's too long already.  But as Shane said, 'if they don't want to read it, they can just hit delete!'  Congrats Shane on Berkley.  Glad you're staying in town. talk to you all later.  Feel free to drop me a line or leave us a post on our website.   RC
